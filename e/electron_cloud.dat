5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens.|$|E
40|$|The {{luminosity}} in RHIC {{is limited}} by vacuum pressure rises, observed with high intensity beams of all species (Au, d, p). At injection, the pressure rise could {{be linked to the}} existence of <b>electron</b> <b>clouds.</b> In addition, pressure rises in the experimental regions may be caused by <b>electron</b> <b>clouds.</b> We review the existing observations, comparisons with simulations, as well as corrective measures taken and planned...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>clouds</b> can {{adversely}} affect {{the performance of}} accelerators, and are of particular concern {{for the design of}} future low emittance damping rings. Studies of the impact of <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> on the dynamics of bunch trains in Cesr have been a major focus of the Cesr Test Accelerator (CesrTA) program. In this paper, we report measurements of coherent tune shifts, emittance growth, and coherent instabilities carried out using a variety of bunch currents, train configurations, beam energies and transverse emittances, similar to the design values for the ILC damping rings. The measurements will be compared with simulations which model the effects of <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> on beam dynamics, to extract simulation model parameters and to quantify the validity of the simulation codes...|$|R

5|$|The proton, the electron, and {{the neutron}} are {{classified}} as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and {{the same applies to}} all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud.</b> However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Electron</b> <b>clouds</b> {{are shown}} to cause {{pressure}} {{rises in the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In {{a number of cases}} beam induced vacuum instabilities were seen where the pressure grows exponentially with time. We analyze under which conditions <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> can lead to these vacuum instabilities. We consider as the feedback mechanism for the instability the following: rest gas ionization by <b>electrons</b> in the <b>cloud</b> and the beam, subsequent acceleration of the ions by the beam, and molecular desorption induced by the ions hitting the wall, leading to increased pressure and thus higher ionization rates...|$|R
50|$|Metallic bonding {{refers to}} the {{specific}} bonding between positive metal ions and surrounding valence <b>electron</b> <b>clouds.</b> This intermolecular force is relatively strong, and {{gives rise to the}} repeated crystalline orientation of atoms, also referred to as its lattice system. There are several types of common lattice formations, and each has its own unique packing density and atomic closeness. The negatively charged <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> of the metal ions will sterically hinder the adhesion of negatively charged protein regions due to charge repulsion, thus limiting the available binding sites of a protein to a metal surface.|$|R
50|$|Together with Professor Ronald Gillespie, Nyholm {{developed}} the VSEPR concept, which emphasized classical pictures of bonding, adapted to include features of quantum theory, but focusing on <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> of varying density within a probability envelope.|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own <b>electron</b> <b>cloud.</b> This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{polarization}} may {{be understood}} by assuming an atom as a point nucleus surrounded by spherical <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> of uniform charge density.|$|E
25|$|The atom is {{the basic}} unit of chemistry. It {{consists}} of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space hosting an <b>electron</b> <b>cloud.</b> The nucleus {{is made up of}} positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is appromixately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.|$|E
40|$|We present quantum {{mechanical}} {{calculations of}} Auger decay rates for two Rubidium Rydberg atoms with weakly overlapping <b>electron</b> <b>clouds.</b> We neglect exchange effects and consider tensor products of independent atom states forming an approximate {{basis of the}} two-electron state space. We consider large sets of two-atom states with randomly chosen quantum numbers and find that the charge overlap between the two Rydberg electrons allows one to characterise {{the magnitude of the}} Auger decay rates. If the <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> overlap by more than one percent, the Auger decay rates increase approximately exponentially with the charge overlap. This finding is independent of the energy of the initial state. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|At {{very small}} {{distances}} between the nuclei the repulsive interaction {{can be regarded}} as essentially Coulombic.

40|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>clouds</b> {{sometimes}} limit accelerator {{performance by}} their appearance when the circulating bunch population exceeds a threshold value. Dynamical models of cloud buildup, {{and of the}} phase transition from “cloud off” to “cloud on”, are enhanced when simple coupling between <b>electron</b> and ion <b>clouds</b> is included. Maps are then capable of reproducing the first order phase transitions sometimes seen in practice. They also predict that hysteresis, period doubling, and chaotic phenomena may be observed...|$|R
25|$|In June EMC2 {{demonstrated}} for {{the first}} time that the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> becomes diamagnetic in the center of a magnetic cusp configuration when beta is high, resolving an earlier conjecture. Whether the plasma is thermalized remains to be demonstrated experimentally. Park presented these findings at various universities, the Annual 2014 Fusion Power Associates meeting and the 2014 IEC conference.|$|E
25|$|Atomic orbitals are {{the basic}} {{building}} blocks of the atomic orbital model (alternatively known as the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> or wave mechanics model), a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter. In this model the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> of a multi-electron atom {{may be seen as}} being built up (in approximation) in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. The repeating periodicity of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s, p, d and f atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the quantum number , particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = 4s13d5 and Cr2+ = 3d4) can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.|$|E
25|$|Gas puffers at corner. Gas is puffed {{inside the}} rings where it ionizes at the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud.</b> As ions fall down the {{potential}} well, the electric field works on them, heating it to fusion conditions.

50|$|Steric effects {{arise from}} {{a fact that}} each atom within a {{molecule}} occupies {{a certain amount of}} space. If atoms are brought too close together, there is an associated cost in energy due to overlapping <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> (Pauli or Exchange interaction, or Born repulsion), and this may affect the molecule's preferred shape (conformation) and reactivity.|$|R
40|$|The beam {{intensity}} of ion beams in RHIC {{is limited by}} a fast transverse instability at transition, driven by the machine impedance and <b>electron</b> <b>clouds.</b> For gold and deuteron beams we analyze the dependence of the instability threshold on beam and machine parameters from recent operational data and dedicated experiments. We fit the machine impedance to the experimental data...|$|R
25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions. The machine confines ions using an electric field {{in the same way}} a fusor confines the ions: in the polywell, the ions are attracted to the negative <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> in the center. In the fusor, they are attracted to a negative wire cage in the center.|$|E
25|$|Atomic Radius: With {{increasing}} atomic radius, acidity also increases. For example, HCl and HI, both strong acids, ionize 100% {{in water}} to become their respective ionic constituents. However, HI {{is stronger than}} HCl. This is because the atomic radius of an atom of iodine is much larger {{than that of a}} chlorine atom. As a result, the negative charge over the I− anion is dispersed over a larger <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> and its attraction for the proton (H+) is not as strong as the same attraction in HCl. Therefore, HI is ionized (deprotonated) more readily.|$|E
25|$|An eight-period table {{containing}} {{this block}} was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. IUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime {{is longer than}} 10−14 seconds, which is {{the time it takes}} for the nucleus to form an <b>electron</b> <b>cloud.</b> No elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay, and have extremely short half lives, although element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{transverse}} electric (TE) waves {{has proved}} to be a powerful, noninvasive method for estimating the densities of <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> formed in particle accelerators. Results from the plasma simulation program VORPAL have been a useful guide for experimental studies related to this method, which have been performed at various accelerator facilities. This paper provides results of the simulation and modeling work done in conjunction with experimental efforts carried out at CesrTA. The discussion starts from the phase shift induced by <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> in the transmission of the wave, followed by the effect of reflections along the beam-pipe, the simulation of the resonant wave method and the effects of external magnetic fields, namely dipoles and wigglers.

50|$|Electrons do {{not have}} {{definite}} orbits, or sharply defined ranges. Rather, their positions must be described as probability distributions that taper off gradually as one {{moves away from the}} nucleus, without a sharp cutoff. Moreover, in condensed matter and molecules, the <b>electron</b> <b>clouds</b> of the atoms usually overlap to some extent, and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms.|$|R
25|$|In {{the later}} superactinides, the {{oxidation}} states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state {{will be only}} +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, {{and at the end}} of the superactinide series it will be only +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> and the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke et al. predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other electron wave functions outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p1/2 shells. This would cause element 154 to be very unreactive, so that it may exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases.|$|E

500|$|Electrons, {{like other}} particles, have {{properties}} {{of both a}} particle and a wave. The <b>electron</b> <b>cloud</b> is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus.

Only a discrete (or [...] ) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.
