25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> John {{tried to kill}} Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered {{to prove that the}} officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court {{interpreted}} the meaning of the phrase [...] "substantially impairs" [...] as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial summary judgment in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the [...] "major life activity" [...] definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises {{to the level of a}} disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled. This ruling is now, however, no longer good law—it was invalidated by the ADAAA. In fact, Congress explicitly cited Toyota v. Williams in the text of the ADAAA itself as one of its driving influences for passing the ADAAA.|$|E

The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> someone is chaste in the sense of not engaging in genital activity, but whether we have lived in a manner that allows us to bring a history with us that contributes to the common history we may be called upon to develop with one another. Chastity, we forget, is not a state but a form of the virtue of faithfulness that is necessary for a role in the community... what the young properly demand is an account of life and the initiation into a community that makes intelligible why their interest in sex should be subordinated to other interests. What they, and we, demand is the lure of an adventure that captures the imagination sufficiently that conquest means more than the sexual possession of another. I have tried to suggest that marriage and singleness for Christians should represent just such an adventure, and if it does not, no amount of ethics or rules will be sufficient to correct the situation." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1981, {{the former}} Rev. Stephen Kiesle was convicted for tying up and molesting two boys in a California church rectory.

In 1987, the Vatican laicized Kiesle. The letter was widely regarded as evidence of Ratzinger's role in blocking the removal of pedophile priests. Vatican officials responded that that interpretation rested on a misreading of the letter, in which the <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> Kiesle should <b>be</b> laicized but whether he should be granted the dispensation he had requested from the obligation of chastity.

50|$|Noam Chomsky's (1957) {{review of}} Skinner's book Verbal Behavior (that aimed to explain {{language}} acquisition in a behaviorist framework) {{is considered one}} of the major theoretical challenges to the type of radical (as in 'root') behaviorism that Skinner taught. Chomsky claimed that language could not be learned solely from the sort of operant conditioning that Skinner postulated. Chomsky's argument was that people could produce an infinite variety of sentences unique in structure and meaning and that these could not possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language. As an alternative, he concluded that there must be internal mental structures - states of mind of the sort that behaviorism rejected as illusory. The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> mental activities exist; it is whether they can be shown to be the causes of behavior. Similarly, work by Albert Bandura showed that children could learn by social observation, without any change in overt behaviour, and so must (according to him) be accounted for by internal representations.|$|E
