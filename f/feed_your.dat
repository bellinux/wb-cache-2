Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of apple cider vinegar. Hippocrates once said that [...] "to eat when you are sick, is to <b>feed</b> <b>your</b> sickness." [...] However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions. This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required traction to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The Hippocratic bench and other devices were used to this end.|$|E

[...] She further summed the album up as [...] "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave." [...] According to Dominic Horner of The Independent, the album's music may not be appropriately described exclusively as either dance or world music, but it is a mixture of the two. Music critic Robert Christgau characterised its music as an [...] "eclectic world-underclass dance amalgam", and Jonathan Brown of the Irish Independent cited Kala as a proper introduction to [...] "world fusion", a genre that [...] "blends sounds from across the globe which wouldn't – and some say shouldn't – be put together." [...] By contrast, NPR's Oliver Wang argued that, rather than a [...] "so-called world music fusion" [...] attempt, Kala is [...] "agitated, propulsive pop" [...] informed by international sounds. Music journalist Jody Rosen called it [...] "an agitprop dance record" [...] that reappropriates hip hop in an international setting with beatbox riddims, [...] "playground" [...] rhymes, unconventional samples, and gunshot sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V.

Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.
