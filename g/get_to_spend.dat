[...] The Greencards were the opening act for Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer tour. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an engineer who worked on Weather and Water, with helping them {{get the opportunity to}} tour with Dylan and Nelson.

500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, an {{extended}} family was introduced for Carmel, including her brother Darren (Gary McDonald), and his two children Junior (Aaron Carrington) and Aisha (Aisha Jacob). According to the EastEnders Handbook, parents of young child actors were sometimes upset unavoidably during filming of EastEnders. For instance, {{the parents of the}} baby who played Hassan Osman were affected when their baby was used in a storyline about cot death, as they had not been warned. This problem was avoided with the two-year-old girl who played Carmel's niece, Aisha Roberts, as she was the real-life daughter of actress Judith Jacob. The writers [...] "obligingly" [...] called the young character Aisha, to make it less confusing for the actors. The idea to use Jacob's real daughter had come from the serial's co-creator Julia Smith. Jacob was initially against the idea. In an interview she commented, [...] "Children on the set can be so horrible", due to awkwardness inherent in disciplining someone else’s child in the workplace. However, she has said that she found it hard to turn Julia Smith down, and realised that she would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more time with her daughter if she also was working on the set of EastEnders. This caused a problem once on-screen, when Aisha referred to Carmel as [...] "mummy", even though Aisha’s character was not Carmel’s daughter. Despite the inconsistency, the producers left the scene in.|$|E
