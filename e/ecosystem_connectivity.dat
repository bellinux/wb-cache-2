30|$|Level {{of habitat}} {{fragmentation}} as evidenced from analysis has shown increasing trend. Habitat fragmentation causes increasing length of boundary, reduces size of patches and respectively halts normal functioning of ecological processes (Collinge 1996). This habitat fragmentation was posing chronic challenge for endemic animals’ viability and conservation activities especially at fragmented landscapes (Mekonnen et al. 2012; Mamo and Bekele 2011; Temesgen 2015; Mekonnen et al. 2017). This is because animals in a fragmented ecosystem migrate from patches to patches {{in search of}} feed and water. Similar to these studies, montane ecosystem fragmentation was reported as chronic problem for wild mammals in central Ethiopia (Mohammed and Afework 2014). In other words, with encroachment of grazing and agriculture to forest and woodland alpine ecosystems, there was cutting of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity</b> by anthropogenic land use types where it affects ecological functioning. More importantly, habitat fragmentation can foster habitat lose and related impacts (Ewers and Didham 2006). Fragmentation will also cause proliferation of successional plant species than primary vegetation types (Chazdon 2008). Simulation results have also shown probability of increasing class and landscape levels of fragmentation in BER which calls urgent ecological restoration works and tight conservation activities.|$|E
30|$|Measuring SC {{tends to}} be based on simple indices of patch (or <b>ecosystem)</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Patch {{proximity}} indices are widely used (e.g. Bender et al., 2003), and are often calculated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based measurements. Other structural approaches to looking at ecological corridors include landscape genetics, telemetry, least-cost models, raster-, vector- and network-based models, among many other methods, which offer unique opportunities to quantify connectivity (see Cushmann et al. 2013). Most metacommunity and metaecosystem studies apply lattice-like grids as landscape approximations, where dispersal is random in direction, and distance varies with species. However, many natural systems, including river networks, mountain ranges or cave networks have a dentritic structure. These systems are not only hierarchically organised but topology and physical flow dictate distance and directionality of dispersal and movement (Altermatt 2013, references therein). Larsen et al. (2012) proposed a directional connectivity index, which is a graph-based, multi-scale metric generalizable to different SC and FC applications. In a graph-based approach, patches (or habitats or ecosystems) are considered as nodes, which link pathways between these nodes. Most work in Ecology has focused on unweighted, one-mode (monopartite) networks (Dormann and Strauss, 2014).|$|E

Here, we assess the value of coordinating efforts in both space and time to maximize the restoration of aquatic <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Habitat fragmentation is a leading driver of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services in rivers worldwide, and we simultaneously evaluate optimal barrier removal strategies for 661 tributary rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which are fragmented by at least 6, 692 dams and 232, 068 road crossings. We find that coordinating barrier removals across the entire basin is nine times more efficient at reconnecting fish to headwater breeding grounds than optimizing independently for each watershed. Similarly, a one-time pulse of restoration investment is up to 10 times more efficient than annual allocations totaling the same amount. Despite widespread emphasis on dams as key barriers in river networks, improving road culvert passability is also essential for efficiently restoring connectivity to the Great Lakes.

40|$|Understanding {{the degree}} of {{connectivity}} between coastal and island landscapes and nearby coral reefs {{is vital to the}} integrated management of terrestrial and marine environments in the tropics. Coral reef fish are capable of navigating appropriate settlement habitats following their pelagic larval phase, but the mechanisms by which they do this are unclear. The importance of olfactory cues in settlement site selection has been demonstrated, and there is increasing evidence that chemical cues from terrestrial sources may be important for some species. Here, we test the olfactory preferences of eight island-associated coral reef fish recruits and one generalist species to discern the capacity for terrestrial cue recognition that may aid in settlement site selection. A series of pairwise choice experiments were used to evaluate the potential role that terrestrial, water-borne olfactory cues play in island–reef recognition. Olfactory stimuli tested included near-shore water, terrestrial rainforest leaf litter, and olfactory cues collected from different reef types (reefs surrounding vegetated islands, and reefs with no islands present). All eight island-associated species demonstrated high levels of olfactory discrimination and responded positively toward olfactory cues indicating the presence of a vegetated island. We hypothesize that although these fish use a suite of cues for settlement site recognition, one mechanism in locating their island/reef habitat is through the olfactory cues produced by vegetated islands. This research highlights the role terrestrial olfactory cues play in large-scale settlement site selection and suggests a high degree of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{components}} {{of climate change}} likely to have adisproportionate effect on the biosphere are rising sea level and increased frequency and intensity of wind-storms (eg hurricanes, typhoons, extra-tropical storms). Within the context of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity,</b> the {{effects of climate change}} will extend from the coastal zone throughout much of the continent and will vary region-ally. These regional effects will be modified by human activities, particularly those that influence the delivery of sediments and nutrients from watersheds. They will, in turn, affect the functioning of coastal wetlands and bar-rier islands and their capacity to buffer continental land-masses from the ravages of intense windstorms and sea-level rise (Bortone 2006; Cahoon 2006; Greening et al. 2006; Stanturf et al. 2007). Globally, sea level has risen between 10 and 25 cm over the past century, primarily because of a net input of water (ie eustatic sea-level rise or ice melt; Rahmstorf et al. 2007) and thermal expansion (ie steric sea-level rise or water warming). This rate of rise is an order of magnitude greater than that of the past several millennia (Douglas et al. 2001).

A {{better understanding of}} the role and life histories of key migratory species is urgently needed to manage the risks posed by development. We investigated the life history of Macrobrachium spinipes (Schenkel, 1902) in the Daly River of the Northern Territory, Australia. We carried out a 13 -mo trapping program (2011 – 2012) at 7 sites along the river between 92 and 405 km from the estuary. We provide the first detailed account of spatial and temporal changes in relative abundance and reproduction, and present information on length at first maturity and Fulton’s body condition factor. Reproduction was strongly seasonal and was restricted to the wet-season months of November to April, followed by a recruitment pulse 3 to 4 mo later during the early dry season. Length at first maturity declined as the reproductive season progressed but did not vary significantly with distance from the estuary. Condition was temporally variable and peaked for both sexes immediately after the wet season before declining throughout the dry season. Relative abundance patterns followed a similar pattern. Contrary to results for other Macrobrachium species in rivers of comparable length, we found an increase in the relative abundance of females throughout the river’s length during the reproductive season and reproductive effort occurring far upstream, over a restricted time period.

In this field-based study, we used a visual census technique (belt transects 50 m x 2 m) to investigate the interactions between fishes and microhabitats at the Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef system, NE Brazil. Overall, 144 belt transects were performed from October 2007 to September 2008 to assess {{the structure of the}} fish assemblage. Fish trophic groups and life stage (juveniles and adults) were recorded according to literature, the percent cover of the substrate was estimated using the point contact method. Our results revealed that fish composition gradually changed from the Estuarine to the Reef zone, and that fish assemblage was strongly related to the microhabitat availability, as suggested by the predominance of carnivores at the Estuarine zone and presence of herbivores at the Reef zone.

40|$|Disturbance is {{a central}} factor shaping composition, structure, and {{dynamics}} of local communities. Drying is a disturbance that occurs in aquatic ecosystems globally and can strongly influence their communities. Although the effects of drying may depend on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity</b> and the dispersal abilities of resident species, {{there have been no}} comparisons of community responses to drying between lentic and lotic ecosystems across different climates. Here, we predicted that drying would have stronger effects on aquatic communities in isolated lentic ecosystems than in dendritic lotic ecosystems, owing to the higher hydrological connectivity of the latter, and that drying would have stronger effects on passive than on active dispersers, because of the potentially higher recolonizing ability of the latter. We tested these predictions by comparing alpha diversity, phylogenetic relatedness, and beta diversity for active and passive dispersers, in both ecosystem types across five climatic regions. Drying caused greater declines in alpha diversity in lentic than in lotic ecosystems. Communities that experienced drying were more similar to one another than those of perennial sites, and this pattern was especially pronounced in lentic ecosystems. In contrast, drying did not influence the contributions of turnover and richness gradients to beta diversity. Additionally, dispersal mode did not influence community responses to drying. Relatively weaker effects of drying in lotic compared to lentic systems were likely due to the hydrological connectivity among perennial and temporary river sites, which may facilitate dispersal of organisms to escape drying and recolonize rewetted sites. Collectively, our results suggest that habitat connectivity may ameliorate (and fragmentation may worsen) the impacts of drying disturbance. This is an important finding in light of increasing drying and concomitant aquatic habitat fragmentation under global change...|$|E

Thermal remote sensing of holding and spawning reaches in the upper subbasins of the North Fork and Middle Fork John Day River provided spatially continuous maps of stream temperature. Multiscale associations between salmon and cool-water areas were assessed by overlaying thermal imagery with fish locations mapped during distributional surveys. Chinook salmon were distributed non-uniformly throughout each study area, indicating that salmon selected certain reaches within each subbasin. The coldest reaches available to salmon within the Middle Fork study areas were low gradient, unconstrained reaches where the cooling influence of groundwater flow was the most apparent. In the Middle Fork, the stream currently managed for grazing and timber harvest, water temperature differences were typically 1 - 2 °C within riffle-pool sequences and 3 - 4 °C among reaches. The reach level association between salmon distribution and stream temperature patterns at channel unit and reach level spatial scales was strongest in the warmest study reach, the Middle Fork, and weakest in the coldest study reach, the North Fork. Pools were the preferred habitat for adult spring chinook in both subbasins; however, riffles were used more in the North Fork, the coldest subbasin. This study identified the problems and also the benefits associated with stream temperature patchiness, or discontinuity, both in currently disturbed and in recovering riverine <b>ecosystems.</b> <b>Connectivity</b> among system components in aquatic ecosystems is generally considered necessary for maintaining long-term ecological health.

We analyse the feasibility of excess lead- 210 (210 Pbex) to study sediment connectivity in a 4 -km 2 Mediterranean mountain basin with badlands (Vallcebre research catchments, Eastern Pyrenees) by applying mass-balance models for hypothesis generation and experimental testing. Badlands in the area are weathered by freezing during the winter and are eroded in summer by high-intensity showers. The eroded sediments may remain deposited within the streams from months to years. Application of 210 Pbex balance models in our basin suggests: (i) a saw-tooth seasonal pattern of badland surface 210 Pbex activities (increasing from October to May, and depleted in summer) and (ii) a downstream increase in sediment activity due to fallout lead- 210 accumulation in stream-bed sediment deposits. Our experimental results (obtained during 2013 and 2014) showed low sediment 210 Pbex concentrations, illustrating the fresh-rock origin of sediments, but also hampering their study due to high measurement uncertainty (especially for sediments with d 50 > 20 μm) and dependence on sampling methods. Suspended sediment 210 Pbex activity reproduced the simulated seasonal activity patterns for the badland surfaces. However, sediment activity decreased downstream, suggesting that flushing of fine sediments by flooding prevents fallout lead- 210 accumulation on the stream bed. Overall, high sediment connectivity was revealed between the badlands, streams and outlet of the basin, as well as the fast transmission of 210 Pbex by the finest sediment fraction. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, we examined long-distance movements for the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a species of conservation concern. We addressed the following questions: (1) At what distances could populations be connected? (2) What are the characteristics and probability of dispersal movements? (3) Do lesser prairie-chickens display exploratory and round-trip movements? (4) Do the characteristics of long-distance movements vary by site? Movements were examined from populations using satellite GPS transmitters across the entire distribution of the species in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. Dispersal movements were recorded up to 71 km net displacement, much farther than hitherto recorded. These distances suggest that there may be greater potential connectivity among populations than previously thought. Dispersal movements were displayed primarily by females and had a northerly directional bias. Dispersal probabilities ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 43 movements per year for both sexes combined, although these movements averaged only 16 km net displacement. Lesser prairie-chickens displayed both exploratory foray loops and round-trip movements. Half of round-trip movements appeared seasonal, suggesting a partial migration in some populations. None of the long-distance movements varied by study site. Data presented here will be important in parameterizing models assessing population viability and informing conservation planning, although further work is needed to identify landscape features that may reduce connectivity among populations. © 2016 Earl et al...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1600 s, dam {{construction}} in New England obstructed anadromous fish access to spawning grounds during migration. As a result, anadromous forage fish populations have declined, which has impacted freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. To determine the impacts of dams on anadromous forage fish and freshwater ecosystems, I used historical and current data to estimate population changes in alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) from 1600 - 1900. A significant reduction in spawning habitat occurred in New England {{as a result of}} 1, 642 dams constructed between 1600 and 1900, resulting in 14. 8 % and 16. 6 % lake and stream habitat remaining by 1900, respectively. In eight New England watersheds, this translates to an estimated cumulative annual loss of 30 B juvenile alewives available as freshwater forage and 538 M year 1, 2 and 3 alewives available as marine forage. The cumulative annual lost number of adult return spawners was conservatively 17 M fish, or 3, 642 metric tons. Lost marine-derived nutrients from adult return spawners were 11 T phosphorus, 64 T nitrogen, and 410 T carbon. A comparison of predator fish growth and condition in alewife and non-alewife lakes showed that white perch (Morone Americana) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) have higher condition in early summer in lakes with alewives. Predator growth rates (length-at-age) were significantly higher in early life stages (ages 1 and 2) when alewives were present, but significantly lower in late life stages (ages 3 and older). Results indicate a greater maximum length obtained by mature fish when alewives are absent, and an earlier age and length at maturity when alewives are present. These results indicate significant ecosystem impacts of lost anadromous forage fish, with bottom-up trophic effects across multiple time scales and biological processes. An ecosystem-based management approach should be used by inland and marine aquatic managers, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity</b> and trophic interactions should be considered when managing migratory fish and prioritizing restoration goals...|$|E
40|$|Deltas and {{estuaries}} {{built by}} the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River (MAR) in the United States and the Usumacinta/Grijalva River (UGR) in Mexico account for 80 percent of all Gulf of Mexico (GoM) coastal wetlands outside of Cuba. They rank first and second in freshwater discharge to the GoM and owe their natural resilience to a modular geomorphology that spreads risk across the coast-scape while providing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>connectivity</b> through shelf plumes that connect estuaries. Both river systems generate large plumes that strongly influence fisheries production over {{large areas of the}} northern and southern GoM continental shelves. Recent watershed process simulations (DLEM, MAPSS) driven by CMIP 3 General Circulation Model (GCM) output indicate that the two systems face diverging futures, with the mean annual discharge of the MAR predicted to increase 11 to 63 percent, and that of the UGR to decline as much as 80 percent in the 21 st century. MAR delta subsidence rates are the highest in North America, making it particularly susceptible to channel training interventions that have curtailed a natural propensity to shift course and deliver sediment to new areas, or to refurbish zones of high wetland loss. Undoing these restrictions in a controlled way has become the focus of a multi-billion-dollar effort to restore the MAR delta internally, while releasing fine-grained sediments trapped behind dams in the Great Plains has become an external goal. The UGR is, from an internal vulnerability standpoint, most threatened by land use changes that interfere with a deltaic architecture that is naturally resilient to sea level rise. This recognition has led to successful efforts in Mexico to protect still intact coastal systems against further anthropogenic impacts, as evidenced by establishment of the Centla Wetland Biosphere Preserve and the Terminos Lagoon Protected Area. The greatest threat to the UGR system, however, is an external one that will be imposed by the severe drying predicted for the entire Mesoamerican “climate change hot-spot”, a change that will necessitate much greater international involvement to protect threatened communities and lifeways as well as rare habitats and species...|$|E
30|$|While {{either of}} these C {{recovery}} periods may be within the typical range for these long-lived forests, {{they may not be}} seen as “adequate” by many segments of our society that seek ways not only to speed up the recovery of C lost but also to rapidly recuperate former forest landscapes. Furthermore, governments are not only required by law to reduce emissions and increase the sources of C sinks, but are also committed to preserve and restore forest <b>ecosystem</b> diversity and <b>connectivity</b> affected by different disturbances. In this way, the slow regeneration rates shown by lenga beech stands affected by fire may be changed by implementing active restoration management plans that have demonstrated potential for lenga beech forest recovery (M.F.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{regionalization}} of marine waters {{south of the}} Iberian Peninsula based on empirical orthogonal functions and GIS analysis. The regions identified are consistent and correspond to hydrological mesoscale and macroscale structures well characterized from physical and biological viewpoints. Although {{it is difficult to}} determine the boundaries of a fluid continuously moving, the procedure used recognizes the most frequent patterns and can be used to reference geographically the most likely position of the limit among the regions. Once established the regions, the connectivity among them is addressed by means of geostrophic currents derived from altimetry data. The main geostrophic circulation pattern depict an elevate connectivity in the area that might facilitate the conservation and recovering of species, but also imply a higher vulnerability to negative externalities and highlight the need of models, marine spatial planning, and coastal management approaches that includes the pelagic <b>ecosystem</b> and <b>connectivity</b> of the seas. Furthermore, the results confirm that the cooperation between public authorities at different levels (local, regional, state) as well as among riparian countries is essential for marine spatial planning and prevention of potential risk derived from upcoming marine activities in the framework of the 2020 agenda and Blue Growth strategy.

40|$|In dryland ecosystems, {{mobility}} {{is essential}} for both wildlife and people to access unpredictable and spatially heterogeneous resources, particularly {{in the face of}} climate change. Fences can prevent connectivity vital for this mobility. There are recent calls for large-scale barrier fencing interventions to address human–wildlife conflict and illegal resource extraction. Fencing has costs and benefits to people and wildlife. However, the evidence available for facilitating sound decision-making for fencing initiatives is limited, particularly for drylands. We identify six research areas that are key to informing evaluations of fencing initiatives: economics, edge permeability, reserve design, <b>connectivity,</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services and communities. Policy implications. Implementing this research agenda to evaluate fencing interventions in dryland ecosystems will enable better management and policy decisions. The United Nations Conventions on Migratory Species (CMS) and to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) are appropriate international agreements for moving this agenda forward and leading the development of policies and guidelines on fencing in drylands...|$|R
