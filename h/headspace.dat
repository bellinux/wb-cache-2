5|$|Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> is an {{electronic}} music compilation album executively produced by Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu. It compiles electronic dance tracks of acts including Claude VonStroke, Flying Lotus and Röyksopp. It featured sound effects and {{samples from the}} Star Wars films, but does not contain any sample of John Williams' music for the series. Hollywood Records and American Recordings released Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> in digital forms on February 19, 2016 and in physical forms on March 18, to decent commercial performance, beginning at {{number one on the}} United States Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and becoming the second various artists compilation to top the chart. However, it also garnered a mixed response from music critics, praise going towards its eccentric concept and criticism that it would likely only be enjoyed by fans of the film series.|$|E
25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge <b>headspace</b> (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a trim size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper <b>headspace</b> and possible increased pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{sources have}} {{published}} contradicting information regarding [...]357 SIG <b>headspacing.</b> [...] This {{is due to}} the cartridge having been originally designed as a [...]357 (9.02mm) round, but then rapidly adapted to the [...]355 (9mm) bullet. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L'Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portatives) 2008 revised documents, the [...]357 SIG <b>headspaces</b> on the case mouth (H2). Some US sources are conflict with this standard. [...] However, the cartridge and chamber drawing in the ANSI/SAAMI American National Standards also clearly shows the cartridge <b>headspacing</b> on the cartridge mouth. Likewise, US reloading supplier Lyman has published that the [...]357 SIG <b>headspaces</b> on the case mouth.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]38 Super, {{a higher}} {{pressure}} loading {{of the old}} [...]38 ACP case, is notorious for being less accurate than rimless cases, and so most modern [...]38 Super handguns are chambered so that the cartridge <b>headspaces</b> off the case mouth, like a rimless case. If the chamber is cut shallow, so the case <b>headspaces</b> off the mouth, the rim is used for extraction only; a standard chamber will use the rim for both <b>headspacing</b> and extraction.|$|R

5000|$|Both {{cartridges}} {{are based}} on [...]375 H&H Magnum cartridge design which provides an increase in capacity over many other cartridges. They feature tapering bodies and very shallow shoulders which prevent them from <b>headspacing</b> reliably on their shoulders. The belt plays a useful role in these cartridges in that it provides a demarcation point for reliable <b>headspacing</b> of the cartridge.|$|R

25|$|Several {{techniques}} use ions {{created in}} a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: selected ion flow tube (SIFT-MS), and proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical ionization dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid <b>headspace</b> using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics {{without the need}} for internal standard or calibration.|$|E
25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by hand, and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that <b>headspace</b> on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms {{and the surface}} exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel <b>headspace.</b> In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E

500|$|On February 8, 2016, {{the release}} date and cover art of Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> was announced, and {{pre-ordering}} {{of the record}} began. That same day, Beats 1, an Apple Music radio show by New Zealand DJ and producer Zane Lowe, promoted the compilation with an interview with Flying Lotus about his involvement, as well as premiering three tracks, [...] "Cantina Boys", [...] "NR-G7" [...] and [...] "R2 Where R U?"; the latter song was a [...] "World Record" [...] premiere. [...] "Help Me!" [...] was released on Beats 1 a day later, while on February 18 the channel Freeform premiered [...] "Force" [...] shortly before the album's midnight release. Hollywood Records issued the album in digital form on February 19, 2016, followed by a physical release on March 18. Selling 3,000 copies in the United States on its first Billboard chart week, Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> topped the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, the first various artists compilation to do so on the chart since 2008's [...] [...] It also landed at number 197 on the nation's Billboard 200 and at number eight on the magazine's Compilation Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, the album landed on the Official Charts Company's UK Dance Albums Charts at number twenty and number twenty-two on the Official Charts Company's Soundtrack Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|Jackman {{suggested}} that Aronofsky cast Rachel Weisz as his character's wife. The director, {{who was in}} a relationship with the actress, had originally hesitated to show the studio signs of favoritism in casting Weisz. With Jackman's earnest recommendation, the actress was cast as Izzi/Isabel. For her role, Weisz read books and first-person accounts about people who had terminal illnesses. The actress also visited hospitals to see young people who were dying and under hospice care. [...] "There were a few days where I was in the <b>headspace</b> where I could say: 'I could go now'," [...] said Weisz.|$|E
500|$|Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> is a {{compilation}} album of electronic dance music featuring sound effects and {{samples from the}} Star Wars films. Musicians Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu, who executively produced the album, gave the producers files of these sounds, but were also instructed by Lucasfilm to not sample any of John Williams' score from the films. Flying Lotus, {{who said that he}} was proud of being a part of the project, felt that the concept made sense given that the sounds used in the Star Wars would be a precursor of what was yet to come in electronic music. Therefore, he felt [...] "close" [...] to the sounds he was using to reflect the universe of the films.|$|E
50|$|The 7.63×25mm Mauser (.30 Mauser Automatic) round was the {{original}} cartridge for the Mauser C96 service pistol. This cartridge <b>headspaces</b> {{on the shoulder of}} the case.

500|$|In early 2015, it was {{announced}} that the band have composed a musical accompaniment to a comedic work based upon the novels of Franz Kafka. The project debuted at the Bergen International Festival in the same year. Also in 2015, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK introduced a series of new jingles by Röyksopp for the TV output of the NRK Nyheter news division, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the sub-brand. On 8 February 2016, Röyksopp announced that a new track titled [...] "Bounty Hunters" [...] would be included on the Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> compilation. The album was released on 19 February 2016. On 9 September 2016, Röyksopp released a new song, in collaboration with Susanne Sundfør, called [...] "Never Ever".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Derrickson {{was chosen}} to direct the film. He had written a 12-page scene for the film {{featuring}} Strange and an assailant fighting in the astral plane while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic [...] Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an animatic, which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an [...] "obnoxious amount" [...] of his own money, but he {{felt it necessary to}} prove [...] "that I wanted [...] more than anyone", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct Doctor Strange than any of their other films. Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film. After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces. On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, [...] "It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my <b>headspace</b> in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use [...] "real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... encounter the fantastical", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for Doctor Strange through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.|$|E

500|$|Critic Jonah Bromwich {{analyzed}} {{that the}} beginning half of Star Wars <b>Headspace</b> {{consists of the}} producers sampling from the movie while making music in their common style, making it feel like [...] "obvious tribute material". The first track, Kaskade's [...] "C-3P0's Plight", represents Star Wars humor and C-3PO's melodramatic character aspect, featuring sounds of Wookiee's roar and shots from a Blaster weapon. Rubin's Trap remix of [...] "Jabba Flow", a composition by J.J. Abrams and Lin-Manuel Miranda used in , is the fifth track on the compilation, which is followed by Claude VonStroke's [...] "R2 Knows", featuring vocals from Barry Drift and described in a review by Pitchfork Media as a silly anthem similar to releases from Todd Terje. Another track by Rubin, [...] "NR-G7", has many samples such as R2-D2 blips playing over a [...] "driving" [...] four on the floor instrumental with [...] "dazzling jet-stream" [...] synthesizers. However, [...] Bromwich also wrote that the later songs on the track list focus less on the artists making music in their typical trend and more on replicating what made John Williams score so great. Consequence of Sounds Derek Staples noted Norwegian duo Röyksopp's “Bounty Hunters” to be less of a bright song {{and more of a}} dark synthwave track than their usual material. [...] "Sunset Over Manaan" [...] by Attlas, a producer signed under the label mau5trap, has a melody reminiscent of [...] "Leia's Theme", and has a more [...] "cinematic" [...] atmosphere than his previous work. The record closes with 	"Star Tripper" [...] by French producer Breakbot, a downtempo funk song featuring orchestration reflecting the neo-romantic aspect of Williams' soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive <b>headspace.</b> I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate {{what it would be like}} to move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the <b>headspace</b> of what it would be like to be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E

50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{is unique}} {{in that it was}} the first ever cartridge to use a belted rim. The addition of a belt to a rimless cartridge design provided the advantage of allowing for correct <b>headspacing</b> of highly tapered cartridges (an advantage of rimmed cartridges) and smooth feeding through magazine rifles (the advantage of rimless cartridges).|$|R
5000|$|Bottleneck handgun {{cartridge}} designs experienced {{early success}} {{and have had}} continuing development {{since at least the}} 7.65×25mm Borchardt or earlier, which {{led to the development of}} the 7.63×25mm Mauser (also known as the [...]30 Mauser), followed by the 7.62×25mm Tokarev. The benefits of bottleneck designs include smooth feeding and chambering and simple, robust <b>headspacing.</b>|$|R
