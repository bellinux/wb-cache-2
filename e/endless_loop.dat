5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogue}} {{audio recording}} a tachometer is {{a device that}} measures the speed of audiotape as it passes across the head. The reel-to-reel format {{was used in the}} very earliest magnetic tape sound recorders, including the pioneering German Magnetophon machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic tape recorders used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape cartridges or cassettes such as the <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> cartridge, Fidelipac, developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the full size cassette, developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the compact cassette developed by Philips in 1962, originally for dictation. Reel-to-reel tape was also used in early tape drives for data storage on mainframe computers, video tape recorder (VTR) machines, and high quality analog audio recorders, which have been in use from the early 1940s, up until the present.|$|E
25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an <b>endless</b> <b>loop.</b> Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum up the courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E

50|$|A turn {{must make}} a net change to the position. Thus one cannot, for example, take one step forward and one step back with the same piece, {{effectively}} passing the turn and evading zugzwang. Furthermore, one's turn may not create the same position with the same player to move as has been created twice before. This rule {{is similar to the}} situational super ko rule in the game of Go, which prevents <b>endless</b> <b>loops,</b> and is in contrast to chess where <b>endless</b> <b>loops</b> are considered draws. The prohibitions on passing and repetition make Arimaa a drawless game.|$|R

500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an <b>endless</b> <b>loop,</b> due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the album is {{pronounced}} [...] "F-sharp, A-sharp, Infinity". This is {{a reference to the}} keys in which each side of the record begins and to the <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> at the end. The compact disc version does not contain the loop.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas {{began to}} study Beckett's works and his next video work Panoramic Rotunda (1985) came from misremembering a line from Beckett's FIzzle No. 7. The {{repetition}} and seemingly endless loops of the same narrative in Win, Place or Show recalls Beckett's use of repetition to point to but also undermine the [...] "sameness" [...] of reality. The absurdity of the forever repeating narrative, of the two protagonists in an <b>endless</b> <b>loop,</b> always the same words but from different points of reference is an allusion to Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{went on to}} {{say that}} Wright's views were [...] "not only wrong but divisive... at a time when we need unity." [...] He posed the rhetorical {{question}} of why he would have allied himself with Reverend Wright in the first place. Arguing that Wright and Trinity United Church of Christ had been misrepresented by [...] "the snippets of those sermons that have run in an <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> on the television and YouTube", Obama spoke of Wright's service to the poor and needy, and of the role Wright played in Obama's own journey to Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|The film's ending also changed, {{the final}} version being written halfway through filming. The {{original}} intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a Pirates of the Caribbean poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it [...] "so embarrassing", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came {{to him in a}} dream. Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice [...] "...the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?' and {{it was going to be}} the satire of the <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> of that." [...] The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.|$|E
2500|$|DC Comics feature Hitler {{on several}} occasions. In Strange Adventures, in issue #3 (December 1950-January 1951), {{there is a}} story in which Hitler is {{captured}} by space aliens just before his attempted suicide. [...] A fake corpse is left for the SS to find. [...] As punishment for Hitler's crimes, he is imprisoned for life alone on a rocket ship which will travel through space until he dies (the rocket ship can automatically manufacture its own food for him); during his waking hours, he is forced to listen to an <b>endless</b> <b>loop</b> recording of all the speeches he has ever made. The character known as the Unknown Soldier, who first appeared in June 1966, [...] kills Hitler, impersonates him for a short time, then pretends his death was a suicide. In Adventures of the Outsiders #33-35, a clone of Hitler is created by Baron Bedlam. Planning to give the clone the same persona as the original, Bedlam gives him a mentally retarded Jewish maid, several films of the Holocaust, and a handgun, Bedlam's intention being for the clone to embrace Nazism and ultimately murder the maid to [...] "prove himself" [...] as Hitler. Instead, the clone—realizing his connection to the atrocities he views— commits suicide. In DC Comics' Elseworlds imprint, The Golden Age, Hitler's brain is successfully transplanted into the brain pan of Dyna-Mite. Now {{pretending to be a}} superhero called Dynaman, he plots in resurrecting Nazi ideals with the aid of the Ultra-Humanite. He possessed a magical item, the Spear of Destiny, which gave him control over superpowered beings that entered Nazi territory, an explanation for why the Justice Society of America did not enter Berlin and end the war. In Fawcett Pre-Crisis comics {{he was a member of}} the Monster Society of Evil with Benito Mussolini and Hideki Tojo, and other Nazis like (List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies) Herr Phoul were other members of the Society. He was shown to have helped in the creation of super-strong Arayn supervillain Captain Nazi. In the Justice League episode [...] "The Savage Time", Hitler makes an unnamed cameo. He is shown cryogenically frozen by Vandal Savage, who has replaced him as Fuhrer, not just of Germany, but the whole world. He is never named, but the character's identity is unmistakable.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of {{time-sharing}} computer systems in the 1960s it was common for a single institutional mainframe to control many interactive terminals. In such an environment server lag is acutely perceived. Furthermore, in many operating environments, scarce server resources such as CPU-seconds were often metered and charged against the account of the user running the program. An unintentional server hog could prove extremely costly in financial terms. These programs were often called run-away programs or <b>endless</b> <b>loops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT is {{the name}} given to the satisfiability problem when the input is {{restricted}} to formulas having at most one satisfying assignment.
