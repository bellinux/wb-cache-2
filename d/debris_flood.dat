40|$|The 921 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}}, a 7. 5 M earthquake with center {{located near}} Chi-Chi of Nan Tou County occurred on September 21, 1999 and caused more than 2400 fatalities and totaling {{billions of dollars}} losses due to destruction and damages to private and public buildings, roads, bridges and hydraulic structures in central Taiwan. This 921 Chi-Chi earthquake also triggered close to 26, 000 landslides with a total area of 15, 977 ha and severely disturbed mountain slopes, thus setting the conditions for occurrence of more landslides and other related disasters. Post-earthquake watershed restoration works progressed without disruptions by major typhoon rainstorms until July 29 - 30, 2001 when typhoon Toraji hit eastern and central Taiwan with heavy rainfall having peak hourly intensity exceeding 70 mm/h. This rainstorm caused several major debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> that destroyed or severely damaged dams, roads, bridges, dikes and houses, in addition to causing 103 casualties, 111 missing (presumed dead), 189 injured. This study (1) explores the characteristics and impacts of debris flows/floods and (2) investigates hydrometeorological and land use attributes of debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> associated with this typhoon Toraji in central Taiwan. <b>Debris</b> <b>floods,</b> different from more familiar debris flows, are extreme peak streamflows containing large quantities of muds, rocks and debris normally occurring in third and fourth order watersheds. Data analysis and field investigations revealed that the disastrous debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> during typhoon Toraji were essentially caused by very heavy rainfalls on inherently unstable mountain slopes that were loosened further earlier by the 921 Chi-Chi earthquake. The extremely intense rainfall of typhoon Toraji provided not only additional materials by creating new and reactivating or enlarging old landslides but also high peak stream flows required for occurrence of debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods.</b> The destruction and damaging power of debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> witnessed during typhoon Toraji suggests that the effectiveness of engineering structures for disaster prevention is limited. For disaster mitigation, it is required to have more comprehensive strategies such as (1) land use zoning that regulates and restricts human encroachment on hazardous areas and (2) implementation of evacuation drills and relocation plan for people currently living in the hazardous zones.

40|$|<b>Debris</b> flows, <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> {{and floods}} in mountainous areas are {{responsible}} for loss of life and damage to infrastructure, making it important to recognize these hazards in the early stage of planning land developments. Detailed terrain information is seldom available and basic watershed morphometrics must be used for hazard identification. An existing model uses watershed area and relief (the Melton ratio) to differentiate watersheds prone to flooding from those subject to debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods.</b> However, the hazards related to debris flows and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> are not the same, requiring further differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that a model using watershed length combined with the Melton ratio {{can be used to}} differentiate debris-flow and debris-flood prone watersheds. This model was tested on 65 alluvial and colluvial fans in west central British Columbia, Canada, that were examined in the field. The model correctly identified 92 % of the debris-flow, 83 % of the debris-flood, and 88 % of the flood watersheds.

40|$|One of {{disasters}} caused by volcanic activity of Mount Merapi is secondary disaster. The disaster usually occurs after eruption and this volcanic activity produces volcanic and pyroclastic material deposit {{around the top}} of the mountain as a result of previous eruption. This material might collapse downward in the form of debris flow as it is affected by natural event such as high intensity rainfall. Therefore, a research is needed to analyze whether existing forecasting and early warning system are capable to provide information for the people living in hazardous area before the <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> occur. This research was carried out using field survey, observation and interview method. Data analysis used qualitative descriptive method by making description of actual condition of the researched location general condition and qualitative analysis of telemetry system installed on Mount Merapi. The qualitative analysis of telemetry system covers network, hardware, software, power supply, security system, operation and maintenance, also human resources. Research analysis used primary and secondary data.

40|$|A {{destructive}} <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> {{occurred between}} 19 and 21 June 2013 on Cougar Creek, located in Canmore, Alberta. Cougar Creek fan is likely the most densely developed alluvial fan in Canada. While no lives were lost, the event resulted in approximately $ 40 M of damage and closed both the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) and the Canadian Pacific Railway {{line for a}} period of several days. The <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> triggered a comprehensive hazard assessment which is the focus of this paper. Debris-flood frequencies and magnitudes are determined by combining several quantitative methods including photogrammetry, dendrochronology, radiometric dating, test pit logging, empirical relationships between rainfall volumes and sediment volumes, and landslide dam outburst flood modeling. The data analysis suggests that three distinct process types act in the watershed. The most frequent process is normal or “clearwater” floods. Less frequent but more damaging are debris floods during which excessive amounts of bedload are transported on the fan, typically associated with rapid and extensive bank erosion and channel infilling and widening. The third and most destructive process is interpreted to be landslide dam outbreak floods. This event type is estimated to occur at return periods exceeding 300 years. Using a cumulative magnitude frequency technique, the data for conventional debris floods were plotted up to the 100 – 300 s year return period. A peak-over-threshold approach was used for landslide dam outbreak floods occurring at return periods exceeding 300 years, as not all such events were identified during test trenching. Hydrographs for 6 return period classes were approximated by using the estimated peak discharges and fitting the hydrograph shape to integrate to the <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> volumes as determined from the frequency-magnitude relationship. The fan volume was calculated and compared with the integrated frequency-magnitude curve to check of the validity of the latter. A reasonable match was accomplished, verifying the overall relationship. The findings from this work were later used as input to a risk assessment seeking to quantify risk to loss of life and economic losses. The risk assessment then formed the basis for design of debris-flood mitigation structures...|$|E

Landslide erosion (including dry ravel) exceeded 33, 000 t ha- 1 year- 1 along the most severely eroded sections of the road and averaged more than 9, 600 t ha- 1 year- 1 along the surveyed 23. 5 km of road; these values are the highest ever reported for road-related landslides. While surface erosion was only about 7 % of the total erosion from the road, it is still more than an order of magnitude higher than typical surface erosion rates from disturbed lands in Southeast Asia. Combined landslide and surface erosion from this road delivered an estimated 19 times more sediment to the river than the remaining 99. 6 % of the contributing catchment.

40|$|Landslide {{occurrence}} in the Salmon Arm and Vernon forest {{districts in the}} last five years has stimulated research to determine how small drainage basins might be classified into debris flow prone, <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> prone, or flood prone. Alluvial fans situated at the base of several entrenched stream systems may have people dwelling on them. In addition to safety concerns, water quality and habitat are also of importance. A procedure is presented here that uses both map-based (GIS) and field-based (fan and channel mapping) analysis to show relative risk of impact on fans. Bedrock and surficial geology are used to type the basins that are dominated by metamorphic rocks. Basin area, aspect, slope, inner gorge, and gentle-over-steep conditions were determined. GIS-generated channel longitudinal profiles were compared between the data sets. Fan morphology and stratigraphy aided in identifying previous debris flow events and their magnitude. Historical information provided by time-series air photo interpretation, historic maps, and archival research provides clues to recurrence intervals. Some fans will have relict paraglacial deposits that include debris flows and may still support future debris flows.

Particularly, in the Vernazza catchment, the event triggered hundreds of shallow landslides and a <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> that caused three casualties. Investigation of slope stability after the event was carried out aiming at defining the most effective mitigation measures which may be adopted in future land use planning. To this objective a susceptibility model was produced {{and a series of}} scenarios were simulated using probabilistic methods. The susceptibility model has provided information about landslide conditioning factors on which to act for reducing landslide occurrence and therefore the associated risk. The simulations have taken into consideration the following alternative types of mitigation measures: (1) restoration of abandoned terraces, (2) reforestation of abandoned terraces, (3) use of local structural measures over stretches of potentially unstable hillsides and (4) avoidance of any intervention. The advantages and the disadvantages of proposed mitigation measures for shallow landslide risk are discussed considering the results of the simulations and taking into account their complex interaction with environmental, historical, cultural and socio-economic aspects. The results show that the most effective mitigation strategy for reducing landslide risk at short-term consists of applying structural measures over potentially unstable slopes. However a long-term program promoting the development of agricultural practices on terraced slopes is necessary. In fact, the simulations indicate if no measures are applied to avoid the degradation of the terraced areas, landslide areal frequency would inevitably increase...|$|E
40|$|For some decades, mass wasting {{processes}} such as landslides {{and debris}} floods have been threatening villages and transportation routes in the Rio Grande Valley, named Quebrada de Humauhuaca. One {{of the most significant}} examples is the urban area of Tilcara, built on a large alluvial fan. In recent years, <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> phenomena have been triggered in the tributary valley of the Huasamayo Stream and reached the alluvial fan on a decadal basis. In view of proper development of the area, hazard and risk assessment together with risk mitigation strategies are of paramount importance. The need is urgent also because the Quebrada de Humahuaca was recently included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage. Therefore, the growing tourism industry may lead to uncontrolled exploitation and urbanization of the valley, with a consequent increase of the vulnerability of the elements exposed to risk.

The hydrogeological processes are described with reference to present-day hazard and risk conditions. Considering the socio-economic context, some possible interventions are outlined, which encompass budget constraints and local practices. One viable solution would be to build a protecting dam upstream of the fan apex and an artificial channel, in order to divert the floodwaters in a gully that would then convey water and sediments into the Rio Grande, some kilometers downstream of Tilcara.

40|$|On 25 October 2011 {{very intense}} {{rainfall}} affected {{an area of}} ca. 1000 km 2 between eastern Liguria and northern Tuscany (northwest Italy). The storm rainfall caused thousands of shallow landslides, widespread erosive and depositional processes, several floods, 13 casualties, evacuation of thousand of people, interruption of highways and railways, closure of many provincial roads and destruction of some bridges. Along the coast, the western sector of the Cinque Terre was affected by floods at Monterosso and Vernazza, causing four casualties and severe structural and economic damage. Cinque Terre are worldwide known because of their environmental value related {{to the presence of}} an historical terraced coastal agricultural landscape. Hence, this area was included in the Cinque Terre National Park and recognized as a world heritage site by UNESCO. Changes of social and economic conditions since the early 1900 ’s caused a progressive abandonment of cultivation on terraces, with negative consequences for the maintenance of dry stone walls leading to disruption of many sectors of terraced areas. The Vernazza basin, which slopes were terraced for about 50 %, was the most affected by shallow landslides triggered by rainfall. A great amount of shallow landsliding materials (soils and debris from colluvial and anthropically reworked deposits and stones derived by dry walls of terraces), reaching the drainage network, increased density and energy of stream flows. A disastrous <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> originated at the valley floor affecting the Vernazza village with mud and debris heights rising up to 4 meters in the centre of the village and, locally, up to 5 - 6 m. Geomorphological features of the basin such as small area, very steep slopes and short streams, with considerable erosive power and capacity to transport sediment, played a role in favouring geo-hydrological processes but also other factors are involved. This study deal with the analysis of the distribution of shallow landslides triggered by rainfall in relation to land-use in order to define the influence of this factor in landslide occurrence. The study highlights the high vulnerability of agricultural terraces, which were identified as the main landslide-prone areas. The lack of maintenance of the dry-stone walls could be a primary factor favouring shallow landslides. The study also confirms the positive role of vegetation cover for increasing the rainfall threshold for triggering shallow landslides. The obtained results, providing basic information for landslide susceptibility assessment, could be useful for identifying proper strategies for risk mitigation and land management...|$|E

Both of these distant study areas are prone to various types of landslide and landslide-generated hazards with tremendous damages such as loss of human lives, failure of infrastructures, and damage on agricultural fields and on the natural environment. Landslides and related hazards have no geographic boundaries. They occur in both developed countries (like Italy) and in developing countries (like Ethiopia) causing a continuous threat to human beings all over the world. The objectives of this study in both project areas were therefore: (1) to generate maps of landslide inventory and various landslide causative factors, and evaluate their contribution to the occurrences of landslide and its frequency in the respective study areas, (2) to evaluate the landslide susceptibility and prepare maps of both study areas using various GIS based methods and compare their results, (3) to recommend landslide hazard mitigation strategies based on the final findings of the study for both respective project areas. The study accomplished:(1) characterization of 160 and 108 landslide occurrences in Debresina and R. S.

Study of these transitional rocks reveals the following stratigraphic units (from lower to upper: generally structureless blue-gray limestone (Bls); a heterogeneous sequence of limestone and finegrained sandstone and siltstone (Hm); yellow-orange, limonite-bearing, very fine silty marble (Ym); grayish-red and grayish-green sandstone, and siltstone, claystone, and minor conglomerate (Rm); red-brown, tabular-bedded sandstone and conglomerate (Rc); grayish-green, fine-to coarse-grained, generally poorly sorted, predominantly structureless sandstone and minor sandy conglomerate (Gc); pale-olive, calcitic claystone and minor tabular-bedded, pebble and granule conglomerate (Osh); yellowish-gray calcareous chert (Wc); grayish-red, well-sorted, fine-grained sandstone (Rss); light-brownish-gray, sandy pebble conglomerate and boulder conglomerate (Vcg); grayish-red and pale-red, well sorted, silty, fine-grained sandstone and conglomerate (Rgss); and volcanic flow rock or sill rock (Volc). The heterogeneous marine rocks (Hm) together with the thick-bedded limestone (Bls) are interpreted to be shallow marine deposits formed in a quiet-water, tidally influenced coastal area that was subject {{to the passage of}} storm waves and mild wave currents. The contact between these marine rocks and the overlying continental deposits is conformable in the south and unconformable in the north. The limonite-bearing marble (Ym) is interpreted to be a supratidal sabkha deposit. These deposits interfinger with midfan to fan-base clastic rocks of the Rm and Rc lithosomes which compose an alluvial fan assemblage named the Cerro Gordo fan. Rm is interpreted to be sheetflood deposits formed mostly at the fan-base. Conglomeratic rocks of the Rc lithosome are interpreted to be braided-stream and debris-flood deposits, generally more proximal than Rm, formed mostly on the midfan. These deposits do not contain volcanic clasts and therefore probably predate volcanic eruption in the area. Lithosomes above Rc and Rm alluvial fan deposits contain volcanic debris and therefore are interpreted to post-date volcanic eruption. These deposits are units Gc, Osh, Rss, Wc, and Vcg, and represent continued deposition on the Cerro Gordo fan following volcanic eruption. Gc deposits are volcanic rich and are interpreted to represent <b>debris</b> <b>flood</b> and waning-stage flow deposits formed in a reducing environment. The Osh lithosome is interpreted as fine-grained over- bank deposits silting up an abandoned Gc channel. Rss deposits are interpreted as midfan to fan-base interdistributary deposits formed in very shallow, braided channels as low longitudinal bars, channel fill, and as sheetflood deposits. The Vcg unit probably was deposited in a confined channel which filled with boulder conglomerate during a storm event and then with braided-stream deposits during lower stage flow.

40|$|Typhoon Mindulle was {{the most}} severe typhoon across the Tachia River {{watershed}} following the 921 Chi-Chi earthquake, and resulted in extremely high precipitation of 1431 mm that induced many landslides, debris flows, and <b>debris</b> <b>floods</b> in affected areas. This paper analyzes the debris flows in the Songhe area induced by Typhoon Mindulle by employing a numerical model for debris flow simulation. The FLO- 2 D numerical program was adopted to simulate the flow conditions of debris flows in the Songhe area, including flow depths, flow velocities, and sediment depositions. Comparing the field data with simulation results, this paper defines an Index of Accuracy to examine simulation accuracy. Ignoring the influence of houses in the alluvial fans, the simulation accuracy was 79. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of ACT rivers and their riparian zones have been outlined in s. 2. 1. 1 to s. 2. 1. 3. Before European settlement, {{the upper reaches}} of these rivers were characterised by bogs and seepage lines developing into creeks and narrow, often rocky, stream channels. Through the undulating elevated plains around Canberra, stream channels became broader with deep pools separated by rock bars, and deposits of sand, silt, logs and <b>debris.</b> <b>Floods</b> formed river terraces within the normally confined valleys, but there was no substantial floodplain development. Snow melt and winter rainfall in the mountains was the main factor in providing an annual flow cycle, with high flows of colder water in spring, and flows reducing and water becomin...|$|R
