5|$|Federal {{agencies}} filed {{charges against}} the KD IIs owner, operator and captain. They further sought forfeiture of the fins under <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> resulting in the unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal for three reasons: the KD IIs activities {{did not meet the}} definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized on the high seas. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{jurisdiction}} developed, collectively termed territorial jurisdiction {{because of their}} reliance upon territorial control: in personam jurisdiction, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Some sources refer to all three types of territorial jurisdiction as personal jurisdiction, since most actions against property (<b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction)</b> bear, in the end, upon the rights and obligations of persons. Others continue to recognize the traditional distinction between personal jurisdiction and jurisdiction over property, even after Shaffer v. Heitner (discussed below).|$|E
5000|$|On June 24, 1977, in {{the case}} of Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the {{requirement}} that the circumstances giving rise to jurisdiction comply with the notion of [...] "fair play and substantial justice" [...] should apply to the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> questions. The Supreme Court significantly diminished the utility of the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> because if the case meets the minimum contacts, fair play and substantial justice tests, the action can be brought under the in personam jurisdiction. Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> however, can still be an effective option to bring the lawsuit to a particular court because quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> allows to overcome limitations of the long-arm statute of a particular state.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{personal}} jurisdiction in English law has its {{origin in the}} idea that a monarch could not exercise power over persons or property located outside of his or her kingdom. [...] To some degree, this was a de facto rule; the monarch's men could not arrest people or seize property outside the kingdom without risking physical conflict with the soldiers and police of other kingdoms. Slowly this principle was incorporated into written law, but problems arose in cases where property owners could not be sued because they had left the kingdom or had died and therefore were not present within the kingdom at the time they were being sued. To solve this problem, the courts created another type of <b>jurisdiction,</b> called quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> that is, <b>jurisdiction</b> over the land itself, even if the person who owned the land was not in the country. However, this jurisdiction was limited to the settlement of debts owed by the owner of the land.|$|R

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{referred}} to jurisdiction over a {{particular piece of}} property, most commonly real estate or land. Certain cases, notably government suits for unpaid property taxes, proceed not against an individual but against their property directly. Under territorial jurisdiction, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> could be exercised by the courts of a state by seizing the property in question. Since an actual tract of land could not literally be brought into a courtroom as a person could, this was effected by giving notice upon the real property itself. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> was thus supported by {{the assumption that the}} owner of that property, having a concrete economic interest in the property, had a duty to look after the affairs of their property, and would be notified of the pending case by such seizure. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> was limited to deciding issues regarding the specific property in question.|$|E
50|$|Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{involved}} {{the seizure of}} property held by the individual against whom the suit was brought, and attachment of that property to the case in question. This form of territorial jurisdiction developed from the rationale of <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> namely that seizure of the property was reasonably calculated to inform an individual of the proceedings against them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> ("power {{about or}} against the thing) is a legal term {{describing}} the power a court may exercise over property (either real or personal) or a [...] "status" [...] against a person over whom the court does not have in personam jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in rem assumes the property or status is the primary object of the action, rather than personal liabilities not necessarily associated with the property (quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction).</b>|$|E

40|$|The Scoring System for Latent Structure (SSLS) {{was used}} to test three {{hypotheses}} regarding the degree of self-participation in dreams reported during sleep onset (SO) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

None of these hypotheses was confirmed. However, the following significant differences were found: (a) the ratio between sentences with Ego substituted and the total number of interactive sentences was greater <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO (p less than 0. 05); (b) the ratio between sentences with Ego substituted and sentences with Ego present was greater (p less than 0. 05) <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO; (c) the ratio between sentences with Ego inserted and sentences with Ego substituted was greater in SO than <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> (p less than 0. 01); and (d) the relative incidence of defective Ego was greater (p less than 0. 01) in SO than <b>in</b> <b>REM.</b> These data were interpreted in terms of psychodynamic models of dream formation...|$|R

5000|$|A quasi in rem {{legal action}} (Latin, [...] "as if against a thing") {{is a legal}} action based on {{property}} rights of a person absent from the jurisdiction.

25|$|In {{the weeks}} after a human baby is born, as its nervous system matures, neural {{patterns}} in sleep begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM sleep.

50|$|Extension of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> led {{to extreme}} results that {{threatened}} {{the justification for}} the jurisdiction. Bearing in mind that territorial jurisdiction existed in a pre-industrial society where transportation across the country was difficult, long, and potentially treacherous, and consider the hypothetical wherein Alice owes Bob money, and Bob owes Carmel, a resident of New York, money. Carmel seeks to recover on Bob's debt to Carmel, however cannot do so because Bob avoids Carmel by travelling to California. Alice, however, happens to travel through New York. Carmel serves notice upon Alice, and attaches Alice's debt to Bob (considered to be property within the state) to the proceeding. Alice can no more certainly provide notice to Bob in California than Carmel could provide, and the transient and involuntary exposure of Bob to being hauled into court in New York by this attachment seems to erode the original rationale of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E

50|$|The primary {{distinctions between}} areas of {{jurisdiction}} are codified {{at a national}} level.

5000|$|Of note, in a quasi in rem {{case the}} court may lack {{personal}} {{jurisdiction over the}} defendant, but it has jurisdiction over the defendant's property.

50|$|The {{form of the}} styling of this case—the {{defendant}} {{being an}} object, rather than a legal person—is {{because this is a}} <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar in personam (over persons) case. In current US legal practice, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> is most widely used in the area of asset forfeiture, frequently in relation to controlled substances offenses. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> forfeiture cases allow property (in this case, $124,700 in cash) to be directly sued by and forfeited to the government, without either just compensation or the possessor (and presumptive owner) being convicted of a crime.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that the mere fact of {{ownership}} of property within a state {{is not sufficient to}} provide minimum contacts for a court to hear cases unrelated to that property.
