It employs a folding antenna mast that extends to a height of 13 m when deployed and can be integrated with an <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe</b> (IFF) capability. Coverage is stated to be from ground level to 10,000 m in altitude. In Swedish service the radar is designated PS-70 and PS-701 and provides target data to RBS-70 SHORADS missiles and 40mm Bofors guns. A more powerful version with a 60 kW transmitter is known commercially as Super Giraffe and in Swedish service as PS-707. These radars are no longer marketed.|$|E
