5|$|When {{a colony}} is <b>dying,</b> for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the <b>dying</b> colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the <b>dying</b> colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a <b>dying</b> colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of <b>dying</b> colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
