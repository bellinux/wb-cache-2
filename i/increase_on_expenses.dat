40|$|This work {{presents}} an {{estimation of the}} profit rate evolution in Argentina for the period 1910 - 2011, {{on the basis of}} five long time series: real machine fixed capital productivity (1874 - 2011), real and nominal fixed capital productivity (1910 - 2011), and real and nominal profit rate on fixed capital (1910 - 2011). All these series show a tendency to fall, according to Marx´s approach, due to relative <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> investment <b>expenses</b> in relation to labor force´s, which represent the profit source. Like estimations for other countries, {{the first part of the}} seventies and later years were signed by a great fall in the profit rate, which later recovery couldn´t reach the previous levels. The tendency of the profit rate to fall take place beyond any change on income distribution, which effects over profitability are more related with short and medium place cycles. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} article author tries {{to focus on}} a problem of {{progress}} in the European Convention of Human Rights. Objectives: The main objective is to discover how the idea of progress, contained in numerous international legal sources, is reflected in a recent case-law of ECtHR. Prior Work: Regardless the fact, that there have been published tens of works dedicated to the concept of progress in the public international law during the last decades, none of them has been targeted on currently investigated issue. Approach: Firstly, the author analyses particular international treaties and tries to evaluate their inspiration by the idea of progress. Subsequently, he finds the reflection of this general idea in the current decision of ECtHR in case of N. K. M. v. Hungary. Results: By the comparison of the codified progressivistic inspirations and their reflection in the analysed case he finds out that this idea has transformed from general statement to assessment criterion with somehow modified content. Implications: By this observation he demonstrates the general tendency of the court to <b>increase</b> its interventionism <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> of a margin of appreciation of the member states. Value: By doing so, he does not just warn of rather dangerous movement in ECtHR case-law, but also offers certain methodological sample, how to detect similar tendencies...|$|R

It presents different strata profiles generated by two nationally well-known stratification criteria based on survey data from the two last editions of the Brazilian Family Expenditure Survey (2002 / 2003 and 2008 / 2009) and it also provides evidence on patterns of change over time. The evidence corroborates that an economic improvement took place from 2003 to 2009 for those individuals classified in the lower socioeconomic stratum, together with an increase of total and per capita average income, and an <b>increase</b> of <b>expenses.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, a visible reduction of savings for families in all economic strata {{and higher levels of}} household indebtedness was also noticed...|$|R

Professional skill expresses itselfs through action, especially through the acting in unexpected incident. Experience is developed into knowledge through reflection. I want to awaken the reader’s thoughts about the road to professional skill, how it is affected by the context we are living in as well as to illustrate the strength and fragility of the professionalism over time. I also want to provide the practitioners with a broader opportunity to independently be able to evaluate the quality of their own practice. ...|$|R

We here provide a method that allows one to compute shade area {{at any given time}} as well as the total shading effect of a day. By establishing a local coordinate system with the origin at the apex of a parabolic dish and z-axis pointing to the sun, neighboring dishes only with z> 0 would shade onto the dish when in tracking mode. This procedure reduces the required computational resources, simplifies the calculation and allows a quick search for the optimum layout by considering all aspects leading to optimized arrangement: aspect ratio, shifting and rotation. Computer simulations done with information on dish Stirling system as well as DNI data released from NREL, show that regular-spacing is not an optimal layout, shifting and rotating column by certain amount can bring more benefits.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} into formation of national innovative {{system at the}} regional level in developed countries gives the opportunity to reveal specific instruments of governmental policy and their adoption in Russian conditions. Nowadays Europe has got its general task in science development to build up common scientific area. According to the European Commission, {{it is possible to}} perform this task if EU countries and agree to unite their resources, and their national scientific policy is reformed under this common European standard. The main instrument of EU scientific and technological policy is European Framework programs of scientific research and technological development. In the context of these programs free funding is given as support to international scientific and technological projects. So, the most favorable climate is being created in Europe, which will let it become one of the centers of worldwide scientific research. The Japanese model of regional innovative system assumes building of brand new cities that is technology towns concentrating scientific research in forward spheres and industrial production. Herewith building of such technology towns to a great extent is funded at the regional level. Tax incentives play the significant role in the innovative activity stimulation in developed countries. For example, in Great Britain big corporations have the right to write down 125 % of their scientific expenses to the cost, small write down 150 %. Taxable profit decreases by a certain per cent what depends <b>on</b> <b>increasing</b> in <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> scientific research. In another at a very high speed building up its innovative capital country - China - a differentiated VAT rate takes place. On average it is 18 %, but it is twice lower in the sphere of IT. So, analysis of foreign experience of innovative development lets us underline the following necessary instruments of innovative policy: Private and governmental partnership in financing of academic and private science along with financing in the sphere of high-tech companies at the earliest stages of their activity (seed and start-up). Organization of network cooperation among innovative process participants in order to improve effectiveness of technology transfer processes. Taxation preferences and stimulation...|$|R

In this paper, we examine the effects that earnings management has <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Defining small positive profits or small earnings increases as earnings management, we observe significant expense stickiness in the non-earnings-management sub-sample, compared with the earnings-management sub-sample. When we divide expenses into R&D, advertising and other general expenses, we find that managers control expenses mainly by decreasing general expenses. We further examine corporate governance’s effect <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Using factor analysis, we extract eight main factors and find that good corporate governance reduces expense stickiness. Finally, we investigate the interaction effects of earnings management and corporate governance <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. The empirical results show that good corporate governance can further reduce cost stickiness, although its effect is not as strong as that of earnings management...|$|R

The main reasons cited for the poor {{financial performance}} of Indian Airlines include: rising fuel prices, excess staff, serving uneconomic routes and <b>increasing</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> insurance. However, low capacity utilization has rarely been cited {{as one of the}} main reasons for the poor performance. The present study thus makes an attempt to measure the extent of capacity utilization in Indian Airlines and its impact on the unit cost of production. Using data from 1964 - 65 to 1999 - 00 and applying a translog variable cost function, the capacity utilization has been estimated with respect to two alternative measures of potential output: (i) where short-run average cost is minimum, and (ii) whe re short-run and long-run average cost curves are tangent. The results reveal that the capacity utilization in Indian Airlines has been poor in general and also declining over the last decade. Therefore, the study suggests a need to improve the capacity utilization, which in turn would improve the financial performance of Indian Airlines by reducing its cost per unit of output...|$|R
