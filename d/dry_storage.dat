25|$|The KKB {{possesses}} since 1993 {{a separate}} interim radioactive waste storage facility (ZWIBEZ). It {{is composed of}} a hall for low level operational waste and a second one for the <b>dry</b> <b>storage</b> of spent fuel. The waste needing conditioning is stored in the central interim storage facility (ZZL). These two deposits are to ensure the storage of the plant's waste until at least 2020.|$|E
25|$|Use of a {{radioisotope}} requires shielding for {{the safety}} of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated into the water towards the source in hermetic bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use <b>dry</b> <b>storage,</b> providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in Decatur Georgia, US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma photons have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of Caesium-137 radiation.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to <b>dry</b> <b>storage</b> casks or reprocessed.|$|E
