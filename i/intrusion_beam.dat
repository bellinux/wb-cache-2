40|$|Weight reduction, cost competitiveness, and {{elimination}} of the <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam</b> resulted from the redesign and fabrication using composite materials of the door outer panel and <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam</b> from a Chevrolet Impala. The basis of the redesign involved replacing these two steel parts with a single compression molding using the unique approach of simultaneously curing a sheet molding compound outside panel with a continuous glass fiber intrusion strap. A weight reduction of nearly 11 pounds per door was achieved. Additional weight savings are possible {{by taking advantage of}} the {{elimination of}} the <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam</b> to design thinner door structures. The parts consolidation approach allows the composite structure to be cost competitive with the original steel design for both the lower production car models and for the near to midterm production vehicles using current state of the art composite production techniques. The design, prototype fabrication, costing, material, properties and compression molding production requirements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS), in particular, are an attractive group materials, offering higher strength for improved energy absorption {{and the opportunity}} to reduce weight through the use of thinner gauges. High pressure tube hydroforming (HPTH) has been used to produce safety components for these steels, but it is expensive. Low pressure tube hydroforming (LPTH) is a lower cost alternative to form the safety components in the car. The side <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam</b> is the second most critical part after front rail in the car structure for passenger safety during crash. The forming as well as crash behaviour of a square side <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam</b> from both processes was investigated using numerical simulation. This paper investigated the interaction between the forming and crash response of these materials in order to evaluate their potential for use in vehicle design for crashworthiness. The energy absorption characteristics of the different tubes were calculated and the results from the numerical analyses compared for both hydroforming process. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation and}} development of damage modelling techniques for woven long glass fibre reinforced polypropylene matrix composites. The objective of the work was to develop and validate predictive models for the intralaminar damage behaviour of these materials, {{with the aim of}} applying the results to an industrial demonstrator component. Two damage modelling methods were investigated. The first, based on ply-level failure criteria and implemented in an implicit finite element code, was developed and validated using a range of coupon tests for a balanced weave 60 % weight fraction commingled glass/polypropylene composite. The second method utilised a model previously implemented in the commercial explicit finite element code, PAMCRASH. This model was calibrated and validated using the same coupon tests as the first model. The models were subsequently used to simulate an industrial demonstrator component, during a two-phase design and development programme. The demonstrator, an automotive side <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam,</b> was designed and predictively modelled using the two damage modelling techniques investigated. Finally, the composite component was compared to a steel side <b>intrusion</b> <b>beam,</b> using a quasi-static vehicle test to a current legislative standard. This test showed comparable performance in terms of strength and stiffness for the two beams. It was concluded that the implicit finite element damage modelling technique can account for the damage and failure modes observed in a woven glass fibre reinforced polypropylene composite, but is limited when considering high levels of material nonlinearity and damage development, due to the stability of the implicit finite element method. It was also concluded that the explicit finite element technique was more suited to the simulation of damage development in thermoplastic matrix composite components, although the research showed that the model investigated was limited when considering shear damaging behaviour in a woven fibre reinforced composite.

40|$|Foam-filled (hybrid) tubular {{structures}} {{have been}} shown to achieve a considerable amount of weight saving while maintaining the crashworthiness. Most of these studies were carried out in axial compression using tubular structures made of conventional metals (e. g. mild steel, stainless steel, 6000 series aluminium alloy). However, with the advent of new materials such as advanced high strength steel (AHSS), Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS), and high strength aluminium alloys (e. g. 7000 series), hollow (empty) structures can be designed with thinner walls to achieve similar or better crashworthiness. Currently, such tubular structures are being used as door <b>intrusion</b> <b>beams</b> for side impact protection in the automobile industry...|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} bolder paint colours {{and the use}} of chrome trim helped give a more {{upmarket}} appearance. The interior trim was revised to give a greater impression of quality and luxury, but since the basic architecture had remained unchanged since the original 1980 car it was considered by many as being short on space and outdated in comparison to its most modern rivals (most of which had been replaced with all-new models since the launch of the Rover Metro) It was criticised by the press for its lack of equipment, with front electric windows only available on the range topping 114 GSi. Rear electric windows were never an option on the 100. Neither were Anti-Lock Brakes, Power Steering or a rev counter (except the GTa and later manual 114 GSi models) One saving grace for the 100 was the option of full leather trim, a rarity in a small car and coupled with the standard wood veneer dashboard inserts, a tinted glass sunroof and the optional wood veneer door cappings, the 114 GSi made for traditional luxury motoring; an image Rover was trying to retain. The only safety efforts {{came in the form of}} an optional drivers airbag, an alarm, a passive engine imobiliser, a removable radio keypad, central locking and side <b>intrusion</b> <b>beams.</b> Overall, the 100 series was considered a rather typical facelift of a car which had been a class leader on launch some years earlier, only to be overtaken by newer cars including the Renault Clio, Fiat Punto and Volkswagen Polo. It was launched only a year before a heavily revised Ford Fiesta.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. "December 2005. "Side Impact crashes can be {{generally}} dangerous {{because there is}} no room for large deformation to protect an occupant from the crash forces. The side impact collision is the second largest cause of death in United States after frontal crash. Day by day increase in the fuel cost and the emission of the smoke from the automobile industry are also the major concerns in the contemporary world, hence the safety, fuel efficiency and emission gas regulation of the passenger cars are important issues in contemporary world. The best way to increase the fuel efficiency without sacrificing the safety is to employ composite materials in the body of the cars because the composite materials have higher specific strength than those of steel. Increase in the usage of composite material directly influences the decrease in the total weight of car and gas emission. In this research, Carbon/Epoxy AS 4 / 3051 - 6 is used as material for side impact beam which has adequate load carrying capacities and that it absorbs more strain energy than steel. The Finite Element models of a Ford Taurus car and the Moving Deformable barrier (MDB) as developed by National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) have been utilized for the analysis in this thesis. The current side impact beam is removed from the car and the new beam which is developed using CATIA and MSC. Patran is merged on to the driver side of the front door of the car model. The total energy absorption of the new beam with steel and composite material is compared with the current <b>beam.</b> The <b>intrusion</b> of the <b>beam</b> is evaluated by using FMVSS 214 and IIHS side impact safety methods. The new impact beam with composite has high impact energy absorption capability when compared to current beam and new beam with steel, with 65 % reduction in weight...|$|R
