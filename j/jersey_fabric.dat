Thus, the fitness function is defined as reverse value of mechanical properties. Generally, the number of individuals remained constant in each generation and the best surviving ones and the ones with lower fitness value were eliminated in each generation. In the chromosome producing, the first and the second genes which were related to knit ratio and miss ratio, got a value of two totally. Therefore, for double <b>jersey</b> <b>fabrics</b> with 100  % knit, two was considered for the first gene and zero for the second gene. Consequently, for single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabrics</b> with 100  % knit, one and zero were considered for the first and the second genes correspondingly.|$|R

40|$|Single <b>jersey</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> are {{generally}} {{used to make}} underwear and outerwear such as T-shirts. Knit fabric can more easily deform or stretch by compressing or elongating the individual stitches that form the fabric. Cotton yarns, which are not elastomeric, {{do not have the}} ability of recovery to rearrange the stitches. As a consequence, single-knit fabrics may have permanent deformation. To improve the recovery performance of circular single-knit fabrics, it is now a common practice to knit a small amount of spandex fiber or yarn with companion cotton yarn. In this study the physical, dimensional, and mechanical properties of back plaited cotton/spandex single <b>jersey</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> were investigated and the results are compared with knitted fabrics made from 100 % cotton and the effect of spandex percentage was also studied. It was found that as the loop length increases, the wales density was not affected and specific fabric hand and extension increased, but bursting strength and fabric recovery decreased. The presence of Lycra in single <b>jersey</b> knitted <b>fabric</b> increases of course density, fabric thickness, and knitted fabric recovery, while fabric width, fabric porosity, and extension were decreased...|$|R
5000|$|Chanel's initial triumph was the {{innovative}} use of <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric,</b> a machine knit material manufactured for {{her by the}} firm Rodier. This fabric was traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a cardigan jacket, and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear. Prior to this, jersey tended to be used only in hosiery and for sportswear for tennis, golf and the beach. Considered too [...] "ordinary" [...] {{to be used in}} couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.|$|E
50|$|The 1920s {{were marked}} by a post-war aesthetic. After World War I, the fashion world {{experienced}} a great switch: from tight corsets and hobble skirts—to shapeless, oversized, and sparsely decorated garments. Women began to wear more comfortable fashions, including blousy skirts and trousers. Further, this era gave birth to sportswear fashion. Sportswear, previously recognized as America’s main contribution to fashion, consisted of a casual more relaxed style. Coco Chanel, known as the first modern dressmaker, made {{one of the greatest}} contributions to style in the 1920s: the two-piece dress. She created two-piece dresses out of <b>jersey</b> (<b>fabric),</b> a comfortable stretchy fabric. The American public was receptive, embracing this relaxed style, which was perfect for the active woman on the go. The combination of these new ideas yielded this loosely fitted, modernized style.|$|E

The fabric of the costumes were coloured a faint blue so they could show up on black and white television cameras. Over {{the top of the}} stockings, the Cybermen wore polythene suits ribbed with metal wings, along with epaulettes made of metal, and plastic piping. Their boots were short Wellington boots, painted silver. In a 2016 interview, Reid, by then going by the name Alexandra Tynan, described the motivation behind her designs was [...] "I had a planning meeting that I had to be at, and I had to have a design drawing with me. My motivation was the clock on the wall!" [...] Although the script specified the Cybermen should keep their human hands, Reid wanted them to wear gloves. However, Reid mistakenly forgot she said she would make special gloves for the Cybermen until the first day in the studio. Instead, make-up designer Gillian James hastily added silver paint to the actors' human hands. The chest units and [...] "handles" [...] were built by Shawcraft of Uxbridge. The handles were adapted from lorry headlamps, while the chest units used a lot of clear plastic and had battery-powered flashing mechanisms. The handles were intended as the housing for wires that lit up the lamps, but in a test shot the bulb exploded and the idea was dropped. Tynan explained in 2016, [...] "I indicated {{that there was going to}} be a chest unit there, but I didn't do any designs for them, because I knew that the units were going to be a props thing." ...|$|E

40|$|Global {{demand for}} knitted {{garments}} {{is growing at}} a faster rate than that of woven items. Currently around 50 % of clothing needs in the developed countries is met by knit goods. So ensuring the required quality in a knitted fabric is a vital issue for the manufacturer. One of the major problems encountered in knitted fabric is spirality. It affects particularly single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric</b> and presents a serious problem during garment confection and use. So controlling spirality is a basic requirement for producing quality knitted fabric. Though there are several factors that contribute to knitted fabric spirality, yarn twist and relative tightness of the fabric are said tobe the most significant ones. In this work the basic single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric,</b> i. e. plain jersey cotton fabrics were produced by a Hosiery knitting machine and spirality values were observed for different yarn T. P.

40|$|In this {{replicated}} experiment, {{we investigated}} the comfort properties of single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabrics</b> composed of cashmere in blends with superfine wools of different fibre curvature (crimp) where the fibre {{diameter of the}} wool and cashmere were tightly controlled.

General linear modelling determined the best prediction models for log 10 transformed fabric WCM values using 27 fibre, 16 yarn and 30 fabric attributes. Tighter fabrics were less comfortable. Progressively blending cashmere with wool progressively increased comfort assessment. The WCM was able to detect differences between fabrics which were more supple and springy, thinner and lighter, and were composed of more elastic, uniform and stronger yarns.

Fabrics exposed to virus by each method were held in 35 and 78 % relative humidities at 25 C. Virus was recovered for up to 14 weeks from wool fabrics exposed to virus and held in the low humidity. In contrast, virus persisted for shorter periods of time on the cotton fabrics. No virus was detected on terry cloth as early as 3 days after exposure to virus.
