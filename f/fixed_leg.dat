2500|$|In the [...] "no-arbitrage" [...] model {{proposed}} by both Duffie, and Hull-White, {{it is assumed}} that there is no risk free arbitrage. Duffie uses the LIBOR as the risk free rate, whereas Hull and White use US Treasuries as the risk free rate. Both analyses make simplifying assumptions (such as the assumption that there is zero cost of unwinding the <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> of the swap on default), which may invalidate the no-arbitrage assumption. However the Duffie approach is frequently used by the market to determine theoretical prices.|$|E
60|$|Jack's {{right leg}} being deep {{down in the}} ground, it followed, as a {{physical}} consequence, that his left leg was bent {{as if he were}} in a sitting posture. Observing this fact, just as he made the above remark, he placed both his hands on his left knee, rested his chin on his hands, and gazed meditatively at the ground. The action tickled me so much that I gave a short laugh. Jack looked up and laughed too, whereupon we both burst incontinently into an uproarious fit of laughter, which might have continued ever so long had not Jack, in the fulness of his mirth, given his <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> a twist that caused it to crack.|$|E

5000|$|The West family {{collection}} {{also included}} other accessories, {{such as a}} buckboard, covered or surrey wagon with horses that were fully rigged {{as well as a}} homestead for the West family. The homestead, made of cardboard, was known as [...] "Circle X Ranch", named for the trademark logo of Marx Toys. Horses in the collection included palomino, black, brown and chestnut color variations of Thunderbolt. Other horses included Buckskin and Comanche. Buckskin was available in brown or palomino, each with <b>fixed</b> <b>legs</b> and a neck and head complete with full articulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>leg</b> versus <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> swaps are rare, and {{generally}} constitute {{a form of}} specialised loan agreement.|$|E
50|$|Like most swaps, the {{contract}} is usually arranged such that its value at signing is zero. This is accomplished by making {{the value of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> equal to the value of the floating leg - in other words, the <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> will be equal to the average expected dividends over the term of the swap. Therefore, the <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> of the swap can be used to estimate market forecasts of the dividends that will be paid out by the underlying.|$|E

50|$|The Van Lith VI was a two/three seat light high-wing cabin {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} wooden construction. The wing was a two-spar structure with plywood and fabric covering. The fuselage was of rectangular section with plywood cladding. The main undercarriage with <b>fixed</b> <b>legs,</b> wheels, brakes and tailwheel were adapted {{from those of}} the Stampe SV.4. The pilot and passengers were seated in tandem with an access door on each side hinging upward for entry and exit. The slotted ailerons could be drooped together to function as flaps. It was initially flown with a single fin, but this was replaced with twin fins.|$|R
50|$|By adding <b>fixed</b> <b>legs,</b> {{increasing}} {{structural strength}} to support landing stresses, supporting engine throttling or using {{a cluster of}} RCS engines that could be pulsed, and adding a long-range radio relay, the LESS design could be extended to become a long-range flyer (LRF). With around 1600 pounds of propellant from the LEM, the astronauts could travel forty to sixty nautical miles from the LEM to explore a wider area around the landing site. This would, for example, allow reconnaissance trips to potential future landing sites, and the LRF {{could also be used}} for orbital flight to return the crew to the CSM in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|A bassinet, bassinette, or cradle is a bed {{specifically}} for babies {{from birth to}} about four months. Bassinets are generally designed to work with <b>fixed</b> <b>legs</b> or casters, while cradles are generally {{designed to provide a}} rocking or gliding motion. Bassinets and cradles are distinguished from Moses baskets and carry cots, which are designed to be carried and sit directly on the floor or furniture. After four months, babies are often transferred to a crib (North American usage) or cot (UK usage). In the United States, however, the bedside sleeper is the prevalent option, since they are generally bigger, recommended up to 6 months, and often used up to a year.|$|R

50|$|For low-angle shots {{particularly}} in cinematography, short tripods with <b>fixed</b> length <b>legs</b> and no center column may be used. The lowest {{of these is}} called a low hat, with a slightly higher version {{referred to as a}} hi hat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> shear <b>legs</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} found on floating cranes known as sheerlegs. These have heavy A-frame booms and vary in lifting capacity between 50 and 4,000 tons, {{and are used}} principally in shipbuilding, other large scale fabrication, cargo management, and salvage operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> length <b>legs</b> {{were also}} seen on older instruments. Instrument height was {{adjusted}} {{by changing the}} angle of the legs. Widely spaced tripod feet resulted in a lower instrument while closely spaced legs raised the instrument. This was considerably less convenient than having variable length legs.|$|R

50|$|In {{traditional}} {{interest rate}} derivative terminology an IRS is a <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> versus floating leg derivative contract referencing an IBOR as the floating leg. If the floating leg is redefined {{to be an}} overnight index, such as EONIA, SONIA, FFOIS, etc. then this type of swap is generally referred to as an overnight indexed swap (OIS). Some financial literature may classify OISs as a subset of IRSs and other literature may recognise a distinct separation.|$|E

5000|$|Gitzo {{also used}} the term [...] "performance" [...] to {{distinguish}} tripods which offered multiple leg angles of 24° and 55° (plus an additional 80° leg angle on Inter Pro Studex, Pro Studex, and Tele Studex models), compared with [...] "standard" [...] tripods that had a <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> opening angle of 24°. [...] "Mountaineer" [...] tripods and monopods are manufactured with carbon fiber legs. [...] "Safari" [...] tripods and monopods (now discontinued) featured an olive drab finish and reversed legs, where the largest-diameter section is on the bottom, to improve environmental sealing.|$|E
50|$|A vanilla IRS is {{the term}} used for {{standardised}} IRSs. Typically these will have {{none of the above}} customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency. A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' referencing an -IBOR index. The net present value (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further under Rational pricing.|$|E
50|$|A {{dividend}} swap is an over-the-counter financial {{derivative contract}} (in particular {{a form of}} swap). It consists {{of a series of}} payments made between two parties at defined intervals over a fixed term (e.g., annually over 5 years). One party - the holder of the <b>fixed</b> <b>leg</b> - will pay its counterparty a pre-designated fixed payment at each interval. The other party - the holder of the floating leg - will pay its counterparty the total dividends that were paid out by a selected underlying, which can be a single company, a basket of companies, or all the members of an index. The payments are multiplied by a notional number of shares.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Killebrew {{showed signs}} of slowing down. He missed his first All-Star Game since 1962, but instead of expressing {{disappointment}} in his streak ending, he noted that Twins shortstop Danny Thompson should {{have had the opportunity}} to play instead; Thompson mentioned the same thing about Killebrew. Despite not making the team, Killebrew's home run total continued to climb, and by the end of July he had Jimmie Foxx and Mickey Mantle career marks in his sights; he went on to pass both in August. Killebrew finished the season with a [...]231 batting average, 26 home runs, and 74 RBIs. There were questions about Killebrew's health as the 1973 season began, as he had surgery twice during the offseason to <b>fix</b> <b>leg</b> problems. He played through the first half of the season, but an injury to his left knee on June 25 sidelined him. A month later, the injury had not cleared up, and he underwent surgery to remove some torn cartilage; he did not return to the lineup until mid-September. Killebrew only played in 69 games that season, hitting five home runs.|$|R
