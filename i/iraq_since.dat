5|$|The New Zealand mud snail , once {{endemic to}} New Zealand, has spread widely {{and has become}} naturalised and an {{invasive}} species in many areas including Australia, Tasmania, Asia (Japan, in the Garmat Ali River in <b>Iraq</b> <b>since</b> 2008), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007), most likely inadvertently during human activity. It can reach concentrations greater than 500,000 per m², endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations. There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells of the mud snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.|$|E
