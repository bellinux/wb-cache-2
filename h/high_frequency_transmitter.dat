5000|$|Komarov was {{selected}} to command the Soyuz 1, in 1967, with Yuri Gagarin as his backup cosmonaut. The cosmonauts knew that the spacecraft had major safety problems, but Komarov stated {{that if he were}} to refuse to fly, Gagarin would be forced to go instead. [...] Komarov chose to fly to protect Gagarin, and insisted before the flight that his funeral be open-casket so that the Soviet leadership could see what they had done. [...] During the preparations for the spaceflight, both cosmonauts were working twelve- to fourteen-hour days. On orbital insertion, the solar panels of the Soyuz module failed to fully deploy thereby preventing the craft from being fully powered and obscuring some of the navigation equipment. Komarov reported: [...] "Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn't deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180." [...] Komarov tried unsuccessfully to orient the Soyuz module for five hours. The craft was transmitting unreliable status information and communications were lost on orbits 13 through 15 due to the failure of the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transmitter</b> which would have maintained radio contact while the craft was out of range of the ultra-high frequency (UHF) receivers on the ground.|$|E

By using this system one can transfers engine's speed sensors data with high frequency to rev counter. This system works with radio wave transmitter. Electronic motor and choke produce analog waves and converter circuit converts these waves to digital waves and sends them to transmitter, so a receiver can get these pulses. This system was test in different conditions like rainy weather and for distance amount 80 meters. Advantages of this system are reduction in wires and car weight, accurate data transmission, and engine noise does not effect out put signals.

40|$|Nowadays {{high speed}} and {{high data rate}} {{communication}} are highly demanded. Consequently, wideband and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receivers should be designed. New transmitters and receivers should also have low power consumption, simple design and low manufacturing price {{in order to fulfill}} manufacturers’ requests for mass production. Having all above specifications, six-port correlator is a proper choice to be used as modulator and demodulator in transmitters and receivers. In this thesis the six-port correlator is introduced, modeled and simulated using Advanced Design System (ADS) software. A simple six-port transmitter/receiver system with a line of sight link is modeled and analyzed in BER, path length and noise terms. The modulation in this system is QAM, frequency is 7. 5 GHz and symbol rate is 500 Msymbol/s. Furthermore two methods are proposed for high frequency and high symbol rate M-PSK and M-QAM modulation using six-port correlator. The 7. 5 GHz modulators are modeled and simulated in ADS. Data streams generated by pseudo random bit generator with 1 GHz bandwidth are applied to modulators. Common source field effect transistors (FETs) with zero bias are used as controllable impedance termination to apply baseband data to modulator. Both modulators show good performance in M-PSK and M-QAM modulation...|$|E
