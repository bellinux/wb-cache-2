2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and <b>ducting</b> <b>system</b> enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the fluid-flow, chemical reactions and heat transfer processes in an industrial off-gas <b>ducting</b> <b>system.</b> A mathematical model is developed and then applied to predict the processes occurring in the off-gas <b>ducting</b> <b>system.</b> Particular attention is focussed on the two-phase thermal behaviour and the chemical reactions. A three-dimensional, two-phase numerical solution technique is used to solve the governing time-averaged partial differential equations. The model includes equations for turbulence, chemical reactions and two-phase thermal radiation. The calculations are performed for a particulate phase comprising non-reacting particles and a gaseous phase comprising chemically reacting gases. Both exothermic and endothermic reactions are considered. The effects of thermal radiation, particle solidification, chemical reactions and heat transfer on the two-phase flow are introduced and examined in detail. Predictions are made for an extensive range of parameters. The effects of these parameters on the off-gas <b>ducting</b> <b>system</b> are quantified. Comparisons are made between predicted results and experimental data when available and agreement is reasonable. The models developed can be easily incorporated into general-purpose fluid-flow packages. The procedure is general, and allows two-phase, two- or three-dimensional computations. Industrial plant can be modelled realistically on minicomputers at moderate costs. Convergence can normally be obtained with ease. It is concluded that for the cases studied, thermal radiation is a dominant factor in the calculation of the heat losses and that the particle contribution to these losses is small compared with that of the gases. The model indicates that the strongly temperature dependent reaction rates have a dominant influence in determining optimal operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Propulsion and Power and the definitive published version is available at [URL] development of radical new aero engine technologies will be key to delivering the step-changes in aircraft environmental performance required to meet future emissions legislation. Intercooling has the potential for higher overall pressure ratios, enabling reduced fuel consumption, and/or lower compressor delivery air temperatures and therefore reduced NOx. This paper considers the aerodynamics associated with the complex <b>ducting</b> <b>system</b> that would be required to transfer flow from the core engine path to the heat exchanger system. The cycle benefits associated with intercooling could be offset by the pressure losses within this <b>ducting</b> <b>system</b> and/or any detrimental effect the system has on the surrounding components. A suitable branched S-shaped duct system has been numerically developed which diffuses and delivers the flow from the engine core to discrete intercooler modules. A novel swirling duct concept was used to locally open larger spacing between certain duct branches in order to provide engine core access whilst hiding the resultant pressure field from the upstream turbomachinery. The candidate duct system was experimentally evaluated on a bespoke low speed, fully annular isothermal test facility. Aerodynamic measurements demonstrated the ability of the design to meet the stringent aerodynamic and geometric constraints...|$|E
