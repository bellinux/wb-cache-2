5|$|He {{at first}} denied being {{anywhere}} near the Farm, then during interview four {{said he had been}} there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|When Peter {{explains}} to Lois why he canceled the party at Cheesie Charlie's, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been kidnapped by {{them and that}} they are Nazis. He {{explains to}} Lois that he escaped by turning into the Incredible Hulk.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E

5|$|Grosz later {{testified that}} Brand's mission {{had been a}} cover for his own. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been told by Clages to {{arrange a meeting in}} a neutral country between senior German and American officers, or British if necessary, to broker peace between the German Sicherheitsdienst and the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Greg Forbes of the Weather Channel {{said that}} the radar was picking up debris on a {{thunderstorm}} near Yazoo City, indicating extreme damage. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not {{seen anything like that}} since a tornado hit Greensburg, Kansas.|$|R
50|$|Gaglardi is {{a lifelong}} hockey fan. His {{grandfather}} Philip Gaglardi was a politician in British Columbia, Canada. His mother {{is a native of}} Longview, Texas and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> “serious University of Texas relatives” who live west of Fort Worth, Texas.|$|R

5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no children. However, {{it is thought that}} he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Roy {{announced}} that he was planning to make a comeback to the NBA. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recovered enough to play after having the platelet-rich plasma procedure that Kobe Bryant has also had to keep his knees healthy. He could not play for Portland under the current NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement because of Portland's amnesty of him in 2011. Roy entered the free agent market on July 1, 2012. Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls.|$|E

Ginger Dick 'ad smashed his pipe and wanted another; Peter Russet wanted some tobacco; and old Sam Small walked in smiling, {{with a little}} silver brooch for 'er, that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>'e</b> <b>had</b> picked up.|$|R
5000|$|According to Bloomberg, [...] "Moffat {{said the}} stress of the case has {{exacerbated}} his wife’s multiple sclerosis. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been ostracized by former friends and colleagues at IBM and lost $65 million in benefits <b>he</b> probably would <b>have</b> received <b>had</b> <b>he</b> stayed at the company." ...|$|R

5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met Frank {{on the street}} on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{statement}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> handed {{the report to}} Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he {{paid a visit to}} Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking {{a lot of questions about}} the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{wanted to}} be a {{journalist}} ever since he was in fifth grade.

He is also the author of Love Will Destroy Everything (2007) and the co-author of The Best of Liddle Britain (2007).|$|R
5000|$|Before recording, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> [...] "lofty ideas" [...] for {{his second}} album and {{described}} early songs written with Julian Emery and Jim Irvin as having [...] "massive choruses" [...] and [...] "very U2-esque". At the beginning {{his goal was to}} make an album that [...] "really, really pushed the concept of dynamic".|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{wrote to}} the Company again on 12 April 1899, once more {{attaching}} copies of his concessions, with an offer to supply the BSAC settlements in Southern Rhodesia with contract labourers taken from among his neighbouring chiefs' populations. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> permission {{from all of the}} chiefs involved to do so. He requested as his fee £1 per man, and said that he had agreed a monthly wage of 10 shillings for each worker plus food, accommodation and fuel. Having split his concessions into two sections to draw labour from, Clark proposed to provide Salisbury with workers from his eastern concessions, and Bulawayo with those from the west. The chiefs had agreed to provide workers on contracts lasting six months, but Clark wrote that he could attempt to supply labour all year round if the Company wished.|$|E

5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but got only 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had been at the home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he had been charged with driving carelessly and failing to comply with a red traffic signal; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been unable to attend because he had a dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|King Haco sailed {{afterwards}} {{south to}} Guðey before Kintyre where he anchored. There King John met him; {{he came in}} the ship with Bishop Thorgil. King Haco desired him to follow his banner as he should do. But King John excused himself. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands than of the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that John King of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, had turned to the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.|$|E
