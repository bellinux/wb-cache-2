50|$|On 24 June 2005, {{a private}} cargo vessel M V Mani, {{belonging}} to the Ganges Water Transport Pvt. Ltd, while trying to pass under the bridge during high tide, had its funnel stuck underneath for three hours, causing substantial damage worth about 15 million to the stringer and longitudinal girder of the bridge. Some of the 40 cross-girders were also broken. Two of four trolley <b>guides,</b> <b>bolted</b> and welded with the girders, were extensively damaged. Nearly 350 m of 700 m of the track were twisted beyond repair. The damage was so severe that KoPT requested help from Rendall-Palmer & Tritton Limited, the original consultant on the bridge from UK. KoPT also contacted SAIL to provide 'matching steel' used during its construction in 1943, for the repairs. For the repair costing around , about 8 tonnes of steel was used. The repairs were completed in early 2006.|$|R

50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components.

Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
5000|$|The AR-7 uses a {{blowback}} semi-automatic {{action in}} [...]22 Long Rifle but retains the AR-5/MA-1 feature of storing the disassembled parts within the hollow stock, which {{is filled with}} plastic foam and capable of floating.

50|$|The Jatimatic is an automatic, open bolt, blowback-operated firearm. A unique {{feature of}} this design is {{the angle of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>guide</b> rails in {{relation}} to the bore axis. When fired, the telescopic bolt which encloses the barrel for most of its length, recoils up an inclined plane at a 7° angle to the barrel, giving an element of braking to the bolt, and also resisting the upward movement of the barrel during fully automatic fire. This arrangement aligns the shooter's hand wrapping the pistol grip directly with the longitudinal axis of the barrel. The pistol grip is also located higher than on many other submachine guns, causing recoil to be directed backwards to the user rather than upwards, eliminating muzzle climb and making the weapon more controllable when being fired one-handed.|$|R

The present technique lies in the implantation of an intramedullary nail with a spiral blade and <b>guided</b> interlocking distal <b>bolts.</b> METHODS: The series consisted of 5 patients (mean age 43. 2 years old). Proximal humeral fractures included AO/ASIF type 11 -B 2 (3 cases) and type 11 -A 3 (2 cases). Follow-up was 15. 7 months, observing absolute bone healing in all cases. RESULTS: Mean range of motion was 120 ˚ (SD 12). The mean central score on the Constant scale was 85. 60 points (69 - 100) on the affected side, compared to the 97. 60 points (100 - 88) obtained in the healthy side. The age- and sex-adjusted Constant score was 86. 70 (SD 13). The physical component of the SF- 12 indicated a moderate impact on health-related quality of life.

50|$|The rifle's {{operation}} during firing and reloading {{is identical}} {{to that of the}} AKM. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the <b>bolt</b> carrier rail <b>guide,</b> rotates the <b>bolt</b> approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.|$|R
40|$|INCONEL alloys {{have been}} widely used in light water {{reactors}} for internal structural components, where high mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance at high temperatures are required. These age hardenable nickel-chromium-iron alloys have been showing an excellent behaviour during their life service. One of the most important Nickel based alloy is INCONEL 600, which is containing about 76 % Ni, 15 % Cr, 8 % Fe and 0. 5 % Ti. Its microstructure is formed of a majority matrix of γ phase, in which some small precipitates appears inside the grains, {{as well as in the}} grain boundaries.

50|$|To fire, the {{operator}} inserts a loaded magazine, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the trigger. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger {{to be released}} and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle.

5000|$|Typically, {{the bolt}} {{consists}} of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or [...] "lugs", which serve to lock the bolt in place. The operation can be done via a rotating bolt, a lever, cam-action, locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight-pull designs have seen {{a great deal of}} use, though manual turn-bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt-designs when talking about a specific weapon's type of action. However, both straight-pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to a rotating bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or <b>bolt</b> <b>guide</b> rib into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in [...]22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is a rotating bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin-Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee-Enfield has a lug and guide rib, which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} {{of a nuclear}} reactor is hostile and the materials used have to withstand harsh and corrosive working conditions. Nickel alloy X- 750 has been extensively used in the nuclear industry for the last 30 years. The good corrosion properties and the high strength at elevated temperatures made this material {{a good choice for}} springs, <b>bolts,</b> <b>guide</b> pins and spacer grids in boiling water reactors (BWRs). The focus of this thesis is on the spacer grid corrosion. A spacer grid is a metal lattice that holds the nuclear fuel in position. It is critical to limit the corrosion of the spacer grids so that the fuel is held stable for safety purposes and also since corrosion and dissolution of the alloy can lead to spread of radiation in the closed water system and consequently an increased risk of radiation exposure for maintenance workers at nuclear plants. A BWR operates at 286 °C under a pressure of 70 bar, and the radiation induces radiolysis of the water, making it corrosive. Significant corrosion of alloy X- 750 has been observed under these conditions. In order to study the high temperature water corrosion of alloy X- 750, this aggressive environment was simulated in an autoclave system. In this thesis, the connection between the corrosion performance and the effect of pretreatments and the impact of iron content of the alloy is studied. The evolution of the oxide growth was studied by exposing the specimens in a temporal range from 2 h to 840 h. The samples have been studied with a set of complementary characterization techniques (mainly electron microscopy, but also X-ray diffraction and atom probe tomography), and focused ion beam milling has been used for sample preparation. Pre-oxidation treatment results in the formation of a thin multi-layer oxide, which improves the corrosion properties of the alloy, leading to contained dissolution of the metal. The oxide formed is composed of an outer layer of trevorite (NiFe 2 O 4), a Cr-rich middle layer which is Ni-chromite in the outer part and chromia with some titania in the inner part. Of these oxides only trevorite is stable in BWR water and when comparing the 5 wt% Fe alloy with 8 wt% Fe, the latter performs better (i. e. dissolves and oxidizes less) {{as a result of a}} higher quality (thicker and compact) trevorite layer created by pre-oxidation. Since the pre-oxide layer could be lost during operation, it is important to know what will happen to the corrosion of alloy X- 750 in this condition. In order to answer this question, the oxide evolution of non-pre-oxidized alloy X- 750 has also been studied by comparing samples exposed for different times. During exposures in an autoclave, trevorite layer consisting of blocky crystals forms on the surface by re-precipitation of the dissolved metal. At the same time underlying metal is oxidized, forming a nano-grained and porous oxide layer. It has been shown that the dissolution rate and the growth rate of the oxides decrease with time, indicating that the formed oxides offer some degree of protection. Moreover, the alloy with higher Fe content corrodes less when exposed to longer exposure time, which makes it a preferable candidate for reactor operations. This thesis constitutes a step on the way to understand BWR corrosion of alloy X- 750, which eventually will make it possible to develop improved spacer grid materials...|$|R
