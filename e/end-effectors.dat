50|$|In {{the case}} of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of {{directly}} moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments; either a direct telemanipulator or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the robotic arms carry out those movements using <b>end-effectors</b> and manipulators to perform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its <b>end-effectors,</b> though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon {{does not have to}} be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility for remote surgery.|$|E
50|$|In robotics, inverse {{kinematics}} {{makes use of}} the kinematics equations to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired position {{for each of the}} robot's <b>end-effectors.</b> Specification of the movement of a robot so that its <b>end-effectors</b> achieve the desired tasks is known as motion planning. Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint actuator trajectories for the robot. Similar formulae determine the positions of the skeleton of an animated character that is to move in a particular way in a film, or of a vehicle such as a car or boat containing the camera which is shooting a scene of a film. Once a vehicle's motions are known, they can be used to determine the constantly-changing viewpoint for computer-generated imagery of objects in the landscape such as buildings, so that these objects change in perspective while not themselves appearing to move as the vehicle-borne camera goes past them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In robotic micromanipulation, <b>end-effector</b> tips must {{be first}} located under {{microscopy}} imaging before manipulation is performed. The tip of micromanipulation tools is typically a few micrometers {{in size and}} highly delicate. In all existing micromanipulation systems, the process of locating the <b>end-effector</b> tip is conducted by a skilled operator, and the automation of this task has not been attempted. This paper presents a technique to automatically locate <b>end-effector</b> tips. The technique consists of programmed sweeping patterns, motion history image <b>end-effector</b> de-tection, active contour to estimate <b>end-effector</b> positions, autofocusing and quad-tree search to locate an <b>end-effector</b> tip, and, finally, visual servoing to position the tip {{to the center of}} the field of view. Two types of micro-manipulation tools (micropipette that represents single-ended tools and microgripper that represents multiended tools) were used in experiments for testing. Quantitative results are reported in the speed and success rate of the autolocating technique, based on over 500 trials. Furthermore, the effect of factors such as imaging mode and image processing parameter selections was also quantitatively discussed. Guidelines are provided for the implementation of the technique in order to achieve high efficiency and success rates.
