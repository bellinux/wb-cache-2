5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> to get these men to stop and turn around. The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E

5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler <b>in</b> <b>vain,</b> there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one).

5|$|In 977, as Bakhtiyar {{found himself}} driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned {{again to the}} Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in {{exchange}} for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but <b>in</b> <b>vain,</b> for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, England {{amassed a}} big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a {{performance}} Bradman rated {{as the best}} he had ever seen.

It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not {{out in the next}} Test as Australia struggled to another draw.
