A total of 11 mollusk species were recorded. Only two species, Cerithidea cingulata (Gmelin, 1791) and Nerita polita (Linnaeus, 1758), consistently appeared in all stands where the former had increased biomass in maturing stands and the latter peaked in <b>intermediate</b> age <b>stands.</b> Vegetation structure and biomass, and sediment characteristics changed as plantations matured. Likewise, mollusk assemblages (based on species composition and biomass) significantly varied among different age stands.

40|$|Estimating forest {{structural}} attributes {{is one of}} the essential forestry-related remote sensing applications. The methods applied so far typically concentrate on the structure of the overstorey. For various conservation and Management applications, however, information on lower layers is also of great interest. Detecting understorey cover by remote sensing is challenging, as passive sensors do not penetrate to the forest ground layer. An alternative to these is 3 D metrics fromactive light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here,we evaluate this technique for describing the vegetation density of multiple stand layers within the temperate stands of a large protected area in southeastern Germany. We combined LiDAR metrics and information on forest habitat types with regression models to investigate LiDAR metrics that are significantly correlated with vegetation density. The top canopy and the herbal layer showed strong correlations with the applied LiDAR metrics, whereas the predictive power was lower for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stand</b> layers. Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between LiDAR predictors and vegetation density depends on the forest type. A comparison of the regression models with randomforest predictions showed no major improvement in predictive error. In conclusion, this study highlights the value of the LiDAR metrics for characterizing the structural properties of lower forest layers, which has implications for wildlife and forest management applications, especially in protected Areas...|$|E

We examined the dynamics of epiphytic macrolichens following wildfire and tested the independent and interactive effects of time since fire and overstorey composition on epiphytic macrolichen abundance, diversity and composition in boreal forests of Canada. Epiphytic macrolichens were sampled in 51 stands of conifer, mixed-wood and broadleaf overstorey types ranging from 7 to 209 years since fire. Macrolichen abundance estimated as percentage cover continuously increased with stand age with highest cover in 209 -year-old stands for all overstorey types. Mixed-wood and conifer stands had higher macrolichen abundance than broadleaf stands in all age classes except similarly low abundances in stands ≤ 15 years old for all overstorey types. Species richness of epiphytic macrolichens reached peaks in 98 - or 146 -year-old stands. Mixed-wood stands had higher macrolichen species richness than broadleaf and conifer stands at 98 years old, but not at other age classes. Multivariate analysis indicated that the macrolichen communities were compositionally distinct for all age classes and overstorey types. Synthesis and applications. Epiphytic macrolichen abundance continuously increases with time since fire. Our results also show that macrolichen diversity peaks at <b>intermediate</b> <b>stand</b> ages with highest diversity in mixed-wood stands. Our findings of distinct macrolichen communities supported by each age class and overstorey compositional type suggest that conservation of epiphytic macrolichen diversity would require forest managers to maintain a diverse age structure and overstorey composition in forest landscapes...|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} aspen Populus tremula, has {{declined}} in the boreal forest landscape. This decline is especially marked in young and <b>intermediate</b> <b>stands</b> {{due to the lack}} of regeneration. Aspen regeneration is nowadays mainly restricted to abandoned agricultural land. The decrease of aspen is of particular concern as it has more host-specific species than any other boreal tree species. The main question addressed is whether regenerating aspen stands in agricultural habitats can compensate for the deficiency of young stands in the forest. Data on epiphytic macrolichens show that cyanolichens increased, in number and frequency, with stand age in the forest landscape, and that there was a striking difference in species composition between stands in the two landscapes. Lichens with cyanobacterial and green-algal photobionts dominated in the forest and agricultural stands, respectively. Notably, cyanolichens were not found in stands younger than 50 yr in the forest, and stands younger than 100 yr in the agricultural landscape. This difference between the landscapes cannot be explained by stand age, stand size or isolation. Instead, differences in habitat quality, due to differences in the physical environment associated with the presence of conifers in the older forest stands, appear to be involved. We suggest that in order to conserve cyanolichens that are confined to aspen, active management practices have to be adopted that promote the regeneration of aspen in the forest landscape, and the establishment of conifers in areas where aspen regeneration is confined to the agricultural landscape. In addition, until new aspen stands with appropriate physical environments have been established, these measures must be combined with the preservation of existing old-growth stands, which can provide appropriate source populations...|$|R

We asked if (1) patterns of species response were consistent with the existence of spruce budworm specialists, i. e., species that respond in a stronger quantitative or qualitative way than other species; (2) the superabundance of food made it possible for species to expand their habitat use in age classes that were normally less used; and (3) the response to budworm was limited to specialists or was it more widespread. Results here indicated that three species, specifically the Bay-breasted Warbler (Dendroica castanea), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), and Cape May Warbler (Dendroica tigrina), had a larger numerical response to the budworm outbreak. They responded with increases in density of up to tenfold over 4 or 5 yr. No other species responded with more than a twofold increase in the same time period. These species also showed a functional response by breeding more frequently in young stands aged 1 - 21 yr and <b>intermediate</b> <b>stands</b> aged 22 - 36 yr as budworm numbers increased. Our data also suggested that many species profited to a lesser extent from budworm outbreaks, but that this effect may be too subtle to detect in most studies. We found evidence of a positive numerical effect in at least 18 additional species in one or two stand-age categories but never in all three for any one species. Given the numerical response in many species and the potential influence of budworm on bird populations because of the vast extent of outbreaks, we believe that the population cycle of spruce budworm should be considered in any evaluation of population trends in eastern boreal birds...|$|R

Three samples {{were taken from}} the as-cast slab prior to tunnel furnace, <b>intermediate</b> bar after <b>stand</b> F 2 and the hot band, respectively. In the as-cast slab, the average austenite grain size is 654 µm with a large size range from 150 to 2000 µm. In the <b>intermediate</b> bar after <b>stand</b> F 2, the austenite grains are remarkably refined, but are heterogenous due to the incomplete recrystallization, which are in the size range of 23 to 116 µm. In the hot band is mainly non-polygonal ferrite. Microstructural heterogeneity exists in the hot band. It is attributed to the heterogeneous austenite grain size in the intermediate bar and the less rolling reduction after stand F 2. With regards to precipitation, cubic TiN and fine precipitates less than 20 nm are commonly observed in the as-cast slab and the intermediate bar. Some complex (Ti,Nb) (C,N) precipitates with a slightly larger size also exist. In the hot band, most particles are complex (Ti,Nb) (C,N) precipitates, in a shape of irregular or cruciform. The fine precipitates which can strengthen the ferrite matrix are seldom seen. These results are in good agreement with the size distribution of the precipitates determined using small angle X-ray scattering method.

Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and mid-story canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing mid-story canopy closure and selected soil types.

The use of enzymes shown to be effective for improving the general characteristics of bread compared tostandard bread, and among the tested concentrations, the <b>intermediate</b> concentrations <b>stood</b> out (10 g LIFE SPRING B productper 50 kg of wheat flour and 5 grams of SPRING 2002 for 50 kg wheat flour). Dough´s rheological analysis showed that someparameters were unsatisfactory, especially in the gluten formation, which is important for the bread structure and quality. Thus,despite its significant improvement with the use of these enzyme complexes, especially containing xylanase, the use of oxidizingagents would be interesting to promote even higher quality in baked goods...|$|R
25|$|The {{conclave}} itself {{assembled in}} the Sistine Chapel on 31 August. From {{the beginning of the}} conclave, it was clear that there were only three possible winners. Domenico Serafini, a Benedictine and assessor at the Holy Office, won the support of the Curia to continue Pius X's anti-modernist campaign as his chief priority. However, many other cardinals, such as Carlo Ferrari and Desiré Merciér, believed that a Pope with a different focus was needed and supported the Archbishop of Pisa Pietro Maffi, considered very liberal but tainted by being close to the House of Savoy. Giacomo della Chiesa, Archbishop of Bologna, <b>stood</b> <b>intermediate</b> between Maffi and Serafini, but in the early ballots he was equal with Maffi and seemed to be winning some support from conservative factions. Della Chiesa drew ahead by five votes after the fourth ballot, and once it became clear Maffi had no hope whatsoever of gaining two-thirds of the votes, Serafini became Della Chiesa's opponent. By 3 September 1914, on the tenth ballot, all of Maffi's supporters had switched to Della Chiesa, who was elected pope. He took the name Benedict XV.|$|R
30|$|This study {{allowed for}} the {{identification}} of three different groups of families, within the heterogeneity of the participating adoptive families, according to adoption communication openness. Two groups at opposing ends showed contrasting characteristics (Clusters 1 and 3) and the third intermediate group presented particular features (Cluster 2). Cluster 1, titled Delayed and Closed Adoption Communication, was composed of the families who had more difficulty in adoption decision-making (having hesitated), who waited longer for the child, who considered backing out during the awaiting time, who found {{it more difficult to}} talk to his/her spouse about problems, who were challenged in speaking about the child’s birth family and who revealed more unfavourable beliefs about adoption communication openness. The children belonging to these families were younger and most of them were male. Cluster 2, called Timely and Opening Adoption Communication, was characterised by a timely communication timing, showing a kind of communication which was not totally flowing nor highly frequent. This <b>intermediate</b> group <b>stood</b> out from the others regarding the lack of empathy felt towards the birth family by showing less positive feelings in this respect. Since the adoptees in Cluster 1 did not know they had been adopted, it was the ones belonging to Cluster 2 who presented more closed adoption communication. Cluster 3, labelled Timely and Open Adoption Communication, included the families who found it easier to decide in favour of adoption, who waited less for the child, who did not consider backing out of the process during the awaiting time, who received concrete strategies on adoption communication provided by professionals, who talked more openly about problems as a couple, who spoke more easily about the child’s origins, who showed more empathy towards the birth family and who presented less unfavourable beliefs about adoption communication openness. These were families who achieved a higher level of adoption communication openness and consequently the children belonging to these families, who were older and mostly female, showed more open adoption communication behaviours, higher curiosity and were able to speak more easily and frequently about adoption.|$|R

Allelopathy is a complex phenomenon among plants that involves the production of defensive chemicals that influence the growth and survival of adjacent plants. Plants like perennial ryegrass become suspect when bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) cover is reduced by 88 % when seeded into perennial ryegrass. Over-seeding bermudagrass with ryegrass (Lolium spp.) is a common cultural practice on golf courses and athletic fields in late summer as bermudagrass becomes dormant. In spring, removal of ryegrass is essential for bermudagrass recovery or decline of bermudagrass is inevitable. However, underlying reasons for this decline is unknown. Objectives of this research were to assess allelopathic effects of ryegrasses on bermudagrass and determine best management practices for spring removal of intermediate (Lolium multiforum Lam. x Lolium perenne L.) and perennial ryegrass by cultural practices and herbicide applications. Cultural practices (mowing and fertility) reduced <b>intermediate</b> ryegrass <b>stand</b> by 10 % when mowing height was decreased and urea fertilizer was added. Mowing height and fertilizer applications, alone, are not sufficient in the removal of improved perennial ryegrasses. Herbicide treatments (chlorsulfuron, rimsulfuron, metsulfuron, trifloxysulfuron, foramsulfuron, and sulfosulfuron) resulted in rapid reductions ([greater than] 95 %) of all ryegrass cultivars. All herbicide treatments enhanced bermudagrass recovery. In vitro agar-assays with ryegrass water extracts reduced bermudagrass seed germination by 62 %. Fractionation of soluble allelochemicals by HPLC confirmed inhibitory activity on bermudagrass seed germination from 37 to 0 %. While cultural practices alone {{may not be enough to}} remove perennial ryegrass, chemical removal of ryegrasses may be too rapid for a smooth spring transition. Identifying allelochemicals in ryegrass could lead to the development of natural bermudagrass herbicides...|$|R
