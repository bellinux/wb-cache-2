50|$|Because the pad, {{like all}} shared secrets, must be passed and kept secure, and the pad {{has to be}} at least as long as the message, there is often no point in using {{one-time}} padding, as one can simply send the plain text instead of the pad (as both can be the same size and have to be sent securely). However, once a very long pad has been securely sent (e.g., a computer <b>disk</b> <b>full</b> of random data), it can be used for numerous future messages, until the sum of their sizes equals the size of the pad.

This thesis compares the performance of three view materialization strategies: Semi-materialization, full materialization and query modification. This thesis first develops a program that generates databases according to user specification.

The {{results of the study}} indicate that for select-project-join definitions, semi-materialization performed best for higher values of P, lower vales of 1, fv and all values of fq with the database stored on hard <b>disk.</b> <b>Full</b> materialization performed best for lower values of P, 1 and all values of fv with the database stored in RAM.

40|$|An example {{program for}} {{automatic}} and speedier retrieving scientific documents was newly corded by dBASE III to save working time, since it {{have often been}} consumed so long hours to searching them from many books.

40|$|Why is my hard <b>disk</b> <b>full?</b> A {{question}} {{no doubt}} familiar to many readers, {{and one that}} has inspired our research for several years. Our goal is to provide more insight into large, hierarchical data sets, commonly known as trees. Hierarchical data sets can be found everywhere. A large number of items, such as files, products, employees, and stocks, can be handled and managed much more efficiently when they are grouped into larger entities. Recursive application of this approach results in a tree structure. A hierarchical file system is a prime example: The user can organize his disk, and only {{has to deal with}} a limited set of files while fulfilling a task. But the PC disk of an average user often contains dozens of gigabytes of data, distributed over hundreds of thousands of files. In this case it becomes difficult to maintain an overview, and to determine what is cluttering the disk. Often no single, simple answer exists. Perhaps another user of the PC has installed some large programs, or has failed to cleanup after finishing a task in his or her relief at meeting a deadline. Perhaps multiple copies of the same multimedia file are stored on the disk. How ca...|$|E

50|$|Also, all of <b>full</b> <b>disk</b> {{encryption}} schemes don't {{protect from}} tampering (or silent data corruption, i.e. bitrot). That means they only provides privacy, not integrity.

Thus, if tampering would be done to data on the disk, the data would be decrypted to garbled random data when read and hopefully errors may be indicated depending on which data is tampered (for the case of file system metadata by the OS; for the case of file data by the corresponding program to process the file).

40|$|Transitional disks are protoplanetary disks {{characterized}} by reduced near- and mid-infrared emission {{with respect to}} <b>full</b> <b>disks.</b> This characteristic spectral energy distribution indicates {{the presence of an}} optically thin inner cavity within the dust disk believed to mark the disappearance of the primordial massive disk. We present new Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectra of [OI] 63 micron for 21 transitional disks. Our survey complements the larger Herschel GASPS program "Gas in Protoplanetary Systems" (Dent et al. 2013) by quadrupling the number of transitional disks observed with PACS at this wavelength. [OI] 63 micron traces material in the outer regions of the disk, beyond the inner cavity of most transitional disks. We find that transitional disks have [OI] 63 micron line luminosities two times fainter than their <b>full</b> <b>disk</b> counterparts. We self consistently determine various stellar properties (e. g. bolometric luminosity, FUV excess, etc.) and disk properties (e. g. disk dust mass, etc.) that could influence the [OI] 63 micron line luminosity and we find no correlations that can explain the lower [OI] 63 micron line luminosities in transitional disks. Using a grid of thermo-chemical protoplanetary disk models, we conclude that either transitional disks are less flared than <b>full</b> <b>disks</b> or they possess lower gas-to-dust ratios due to a depletion of gas mass.
