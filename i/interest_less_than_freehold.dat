With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R

50|$|The {{provisions}} of the habendum clause must agree with those stated in the granting clause. For example, if the grantor conveys a time share interest or an <b>interest</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> fee simple absolute, the habendum clause would specify the owner's rights {{as well as how}} those rights are limited (a specific time frame or certain prohibited activities, for instance). Many states, such as Pennsylvania, require a deed to have a habendum clause in order for the deed to be officially recorded and recognized by the Recorder of Deeds.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{elevated}} temperature slow plastic flow properties of the B 2 aluminide Fe- 39. 8 at. % Al was undertaken. Polycrystalline materials possessing several different microstructures were produced by the hot extrusion of prealloyed powder and, in some cases, postextrusion heat treatments. Compression tests were conducted in air at 1200, 1300 and 1400 K. Such testing revealed that the extrusion temperature affected the active deformation mechanisms where material extruded at 1505 K had a stress exponent about twice that of the intermetallic extruded at 1200 K. Grain size refinement to about 10 microns was found to strengthen the Fe- 39. 8 at. % Al material; unfortunately, the effectiveness of such strengthening {{is limited to a}} homologous temperature of about 0. 75 for strain rates of commercial <b>interest</b> (<b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 to the - 7 th/sec) ...|$|R
40|$|The authors tested {{animal and}} machine {{harvesting}} as alternative systems for salvaging windthrown trees in regenerated patch cuts. Removal intensity was very low, averaging between 10 and 20 m 3 ha− 1, or between 30 and 60 % {{of the initial}} stocking. Both systems performed well. Damage to regeneration never exceeded 5 % of the total number. Soil disturbance was very shallow, and <b>interested</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 3 % of the total area. No {{significant difference was found}} between the animal and the machine treatments. From an economic viewpoint, the animal system broke even, whereas the machine system accrued an average profit of over 200 € ha− 1. However, profit was not as large as to become a major driver. Park users may represent the main factor when selecting a specific salvage system, and should be the subject of future research...|$|R

25|$|The {{intermediate}} level, marketable minority <b>interest,</b> is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{the controlling}} <b>interest</b> level and {{higher than the}} non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges {{where there is a}} ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies – small blocks of stock that represent <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 50% of the company's equity, and usually much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 50%.|$|R
