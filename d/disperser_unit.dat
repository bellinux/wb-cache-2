The monads and tetrads may form larger clumps of pollen {{with the aid}} of the following substances: a) pollenkitt, a product of in situ degeneration of the tapetum; b) tryphine, a product of tapetal extra situm degeneration, found only in Cruciferae; c) elastoviscin, a highly viscous product of the degeneration of a limited number of tapetal cells, found only in certain Orchidaceae; d) viscin threads or sporopollenin filaments arising from the pollen exine. The number of pollen grains composing the clumps depends on pollen diameter and the cohesive forces holding the pollen grains together.

We test these hypotheses using survey data on 119 franchisees within a single Dutch franchise system. Our results show that the extent of franchisee entrepreneurial behavior varies considerably, even within a single franchise system. The differences in franchisees' entrepreneurial behaviors can be explained by differences in franchisees' intrinsic goals, relational satisfaction and local competition...|$|R

40|$|TechCon 2017 (CRUSER) Presented by Capt Elle Ekman, USMC: NPS Operations ResearchIncludes slidesTo support highly maneuverable <b>units</b> <b>dispersed</b> over {{operational}} areas, Marine Corps logistics must be responsive, flexible, and sustainable. This becomes difficult with {{increasingly complex}} terrain and {{large areas of}} operation. Progressively reliable unmanned systems could reduce Marine risk and workload, and increase throughput, efficiency, and flexibility in logistics processes. No concept of operation or employment currently exists for unmanned logistics system (ULS) sustainment however, and so this research attempts to gain insight into how ULSs can be leveraged to logistically support <b>dispersed</b> small <b>units.</b> This research utilizes a discrete event simulation that models a Marine Corps logistics chain from the sea to <b>dispersed</b> <b>units</b> on the battle space. The simulation focuses on supplies moving through the unit logistic chain both in a traditional linear manner from a “higher” unit to a “lower” unit, {{as well as a}} hub-and-spoke method where a single unit predominately handles the logistics throughput. The simulation is then run using a design of experiments (DOE). The DOE varies the simulation’s input factors so that, in combination with data analytics, we can see what factors are important to a successful ULS simulation run, and thus can inform decision makers in the creation of ULS concepts of operation and employment. This research also looks at the variability that comes with real world scenarios, and attempts to categorize risk. The simulation is based on a recent scenario done by the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL), and this research is concurrent with work being done by Marine Corps Installation & Logistics (I&L) as well as the Marine Corps Operations Research Directorate (OAD).

40|$|The {{conditions}} facing {{multinational corporations}} today reflect the increasing globalization of international business, in which knowledge {{is an important}} ingredient. Subsidiaries are important as they, to various degrees, possess unique knowledge, thus accounting for {{the strength of the}} multinational corporation, which is the topic under study in this thesis. The multinational corporation consists of geographically <b>dispersed</b> <b>units,</b> which are linked together in a complicated pattern. One of the issues explored in this thesis is what drives the knowledge creation of subsidiaries, as it is acknowledged that the strength of a multinational corporation resides in these globally <b>dispersed</b> <b>units.</b> Another issue is to investigate the role of headquarters’ recognition and of corporate relationships in sharing of subsidiary knowledge. A third issue explored is the use of Centres of Excellence and transnational teams as two organizational forms for knowledge creation and sharing. A combination of research methods was used to provide an enhanced picture of the research phenomena. As a part of an international research project, a survey was undertaken, resulting in data from 2107 foreign-owned subsidiaries located in seven different countries. In addition, two case studies have been performed in order to gain deeper understanding of (i) how subsidiaries create knowledge and (ii) the use of different organizational forms in MNCs for processing knowledge. The five papers included discuss creation and sharing of subsidiary knowledge. It was confirmed that subsidiaries create knowledge of significance for other units within the multinational corporation. The results show that that one of the main drivers for the creation of knowledge is interaction based on local market relationships, especially those with market customers. Corporate sharing of subsidiary knowledge is brought about by headquarters recognition of these units’ knowledge. This is facilitated if other corporate units {{have been involved in the}} creation of that knowledge. Another finding in the study is the use of Centres of Excellence and transnational teams for knowledge creation and sharing. Although the two different organizational forms serve the same purpose, they differ in organization and in antecedents to their knowledge processes...|$|R

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, the {{battalion}} became the major tactical unit of the army.

The British Army, increasingly compelled to <b>disperse</b> <b>units</b> in far-flung colonial outposts, made {{the battalion}} the basic unit, under a lieutenant colonel. The function of the Regiment became administrative rather than tactical. The Colonel of a regiment remained an influential figure but rarely commanded any of its battalions in the field. Many regiments consisted of one battalion only, plus a depot and recruiting parties in Britain or Ireland if the unit was serving overseas. Where more troops were required for a war or garrison duties, second, third and even subsequent battalions of a regiment were raised, but it was rare for more than one battalion of a regiment to serve in the same brigade or division.|$|R

To address this emerging threat, the Marine Corps is developing the Enhanced Company (EC) concept, with the aim of providing the company commander with the tools necessary to make isolated decisions in an increasingly complex battlefield. In order to make timely, independent decisions and maintain information superiority these widely <b>dispersed</b> <b>units</b> will require organic access to services normally provided by higher headquarters. The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is working to enhance the decision-making capabilities of the infantry company through the development of the Company Level Intelligence Center (CLIC) and the Company Level Operations Center (CLOC). Current Marine Corps communications capabilities cannot meet the data demands of widely <b>dispersed</b> lower echelon <b>units.</b> The communications equipment organic to these units is mostly Line of Sight (LOS) technology. These systems limit the geographic dispersion of the units and are limited in data throughput capability. To allow for wider dispersion on the battlefield while providing the connectivity required for isolated decision making, these units require communications assets that are capable of operating Beyond the Line of Sight (BLOS) such as Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment.
