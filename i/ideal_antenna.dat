40|$|High-frequency (HF) radars are {{routinely}} used for remotely sensing ocean surface currents. However, {{the performance of}} the most widely used direction-finding HF radar is degraded due to the effect of the inevitable deviations of actual antenna pattern on the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. In this paper, we quantify the DOA estimation error resulting from the deviation of the actual antenna pattern from the ideal one. Theoretical analysis and field experiment results suggest that the ratio of the deviations for the two loops dominates the DOA estimation error. Thus, eliminating the effect of the antenna pattern deviations on DOA estimation error is transformed into eliminating the effect of this ratio. From this, a calibration method based on the time-averaged local spatial coverage rate (TLSCR) is proposed to reduce the effect of the antenna pattern deviations on current extraction, which uses the <b>ideal</b> <b>antenna</b> pattern to estimate the DOA of the echoes. To validate this proposed calibration method, we assess the radar-derived radial velocities by comparing with in situ observations.

40|$|Conventionally, {{the spacing}} between {{adjacent}} elements in an antenna array are set at half-a-wavelength {{in order to}} obtain maximum spatial resolution while avoiding spurious sidelobes. However, for antenna arrays that are implemented in a compact manner, the spacing between the adjacent elements can be significantly less than half-a-wavelength. The small spacing between the antennas results in strong mutual coupling between the antennas, which has been shown to affect the performance of array algorithms, through modifying the antenna pattern and reducing the antenna efficiency. Recently, impedance matching techniques have been proposed for multiple antenna systems for diversity and MIMO applications, in order to counteract the aforesaid coupling effects. In this paper, we study the impact of different impedance matching conditions on the Cramer-Rao bound performance of direction-of-arrival estimation of compact antenna arrays.

According to the prototype, a contrasting experiment dealing with the flatness of the radiating plane is conducted to test the simulation method. The advantage of the EC model is validated by comparisons of the EC model and two classical roughness models (sine wave and fractal function), which shows that the EC model gives a more accurate description model for roughness, the maximum error is 13 %. The existence of roughness strongly broadens the beamwidth and raises the side-lobe level of SWA, which is 1.2 {{times greater than the}} <b>ideal</b> <b>antenna.</b> In addition, effect of the EC model’s evaluation indices is investigated, the most affected scale of the roughness is found, which is 1 / 10 of the working wavelength.
