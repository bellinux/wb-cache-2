Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an ordinary refractive index no while light polarized in parallel will experience an extraordinary refractive index ne. The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction, Δn = ne − no. Light propagating {{in the direction of the}} optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be no independent of polarization. For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams. For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction. This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear, circular and elliptical polarizations with waveplates.|$|R

However, the detailed characterization of skin collagen fibers using optical anisotropy methods remains elusive. A clear understanding of collagen fiber organization in skin tissues may be important {{in the interpretation of}} their structural-functional relationships under normal and pathological conditions. In this study, fiber orientation in collagen bundles (CBs) and their supramolecular organization were examined in rat skin using polarization microscopy and image analysis. Image variations with rotation of the microscope stage and selection of the in-depth focus plane were investigated in unstained sections of varying thicknesses from rat skin fragments. Total birefringence (image analysis) and <b>form</b> and intrinsic <b>birefringence</b> (Sénarmont's method) were estimated. Based on the birefringent images, CBs were found to contain intercrossing points with a twisted helical distribution of collagen fibers (chiral elements) and frequently presented circular structures. Collagen fibers were observed to extend from the surface level to deeper planes, creating a 3 D-network of oriented intertwined CBs. At least three levels of birefringent brilliance intensity were revealed by image analysis, indicating a heterogeneous spatial organization of the CBs. Slight differences in optical retardations were found for CBs immersed in some of the fluids used in a comparison of 170 - and 240 -day old rats. Polarization microscopy studies provide detailed high-quality structural information on rat skin CBs. A 3 D-network structure based on image analysis and birefringence compensation for collagen fibers is suggested for CBs. <b>Form</b> and intrinsic <b>birefringence</b> evaluation can reveal differences in the rat skin associated with age at the levels of collagen fiber crystallinity and macromolecular organization.

40|$|Birefringence {{measurements}} are {{of great importance}} in a plethora of applications spanning from biology to optical communications. Birefringence measurements of nerve-fiber layers have emerged as an important diagnostic technique for early detection of glaucoma. Stress-induced birefringence in optical devices affects their performances by causing Polarization-Mode Dispersion (PMD) and Polarization-Dependent Loss (PDL). Stress-relaxation constitutes a key phenomenon governing the fabrication of some optical devices such as Long-Period Fiber Gratings (LPFGs). This drives {{the need to develop}} accurate optical instrumentation techniques to evaluate <b>form</b> and stress-induced <b>birefringence.</b> This thesis deals with the development of new high-accuracy techniques for the characterization of stress-induced birefringence in optical devices. The new Two-Waveplate Compensator (TWC) technique is presented for single-point retardation measurements. It is extensively compared theoretically and experimentally to existing techniques including the Snarmont and Brace-Khler techniques. The Phase-Stepping Two-Waveplate Retarder (PSTWR) is also presented for high-accuracy measurements of retardation magnitude and orientation. The Colorimetry-Based Retardation Method (CBRM) is presented to measure retardation using white-light interference colors. The technique is implemented using a polarization microscope and a spectrophotometer. The TWC and the Brace-Khler methods are implemented for full-field retardation measurements using a polarization microscope. Their accuracies are quantified over the entire field-of-view for small retardations. They are applied to the stress-induced birefringence imaging of LPFGs and polymer pillar waveguides. The TWC technique achieves an accuracy of 0. 06 nm and a sensitivity of 0. 07 nm. The Brace- Khler technique achieves an accuracy of 0. 04 nm and a sensitivity of 0. 09 nm. The spatial resolution of both techniques is 0. 45 and # 61549;m. A Fourier-based algorithm is presented to compute the inverse Abel transform relating the retardation to the axial residual stress profile in optical fibers. It is used to calculate the residual stress profiles of single-mode fibers from full-field retardation measurements with the TWC and Brace- Khler techniques. The stress profiles computed in this work are in very good agreement with previously reported results in the literature. The TWC technique produces the most accurate stress measurements. The TWC technique is used to investigate the stress-relaxation phenomena in LPFGs fabricated using CO 2 laser irradiations. Ph. D.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with modelling long chain branched polymer melts using the McLeish and Larson Pompom constitutive equations. Usually the non-linear terms in this model are fitted to uniaxial extensional data due its sensitivity to levels of branching, but in this thesis I will study {{a number of other}} non-linear flows using this model. For each flow the results are compared to experiments on a set of polyethylene melts. The first flow types I examine are simple shear flows. In a shear step-strain flow the stress relaxation of branched polymers is observed to be time-strain separable, whereby the relaxation modulus can be separated into the product of separate functions of time and strain. I show that although the Pompom model is not time-strain separable in general, there exist subsets of parameter values for which time-strain separability is valid. For these sets a branched damping function is derived which is analogous to the Doi-Edwards damping function for linear polymer melts. The other simple shear flow examined is oscillatory shear. Commonly, oscillatory shear is probed at low strain amplitudes over a range of frequencies to measure the usual dynamic moduli of linear viscoelasticity. In this work the effect of strain amplitude is explored up to absolute strains of order unity. The non-linear stress response is analysed from the higher harmonics in the Fourier series. In particular it is shown that the third Fourier components are dependent on the Pompom non-linear stretch relaxation time and a low-strain asymptote is obtained. Subsequently, this thesis focuses on the stagnation point flow generated in a cross-slot geometry. The stress calculated from the Pompom constitutive model is compared to experimental flow induced birefringence images. It is shown for linear and lightly branched materials that the Pompom model predicts both the <b>form</b> of the <b>birefringence</b> pattern and stress values obtained from the stress-optical law. However, for more highly branched polymers the Pompom model fails to predict the change to birefringence patterns. Subsequent analysis shows that there could exist a transient overshoot in extension which the Pompom model cannot capture as it stands. In the final part of my thesis I suggest an empirical alteration to the Pompom constitutive model to capture this transient extensional overshoot, which is able to resolve the differences between experimental flow induced birefringence images and theoretical simulations.

To allow for readers with backgrounds other than geophysics, basic terms like anisotropy {{and the types of}} body waves are explained in 2. 2 and 2. 3. Also included in this section is the polarization and splitting of shear-waves and its link to transverse isotropy. Large portions of the thesis rely on understanding the effects of the Thomsen parameters, so special care is taken to properly define them and their relationship with Hooke’s law and the phase velocities of P- and S-waves in 2. 4. Definitions of terms involved in AVO and AVOA analysis, such as AVO gradient as well as examples of use and underlying assumptions of the concepts are provided in 2. 5 and 2. 6. The Zoeppritz equations describe exactly how seismic waves are reflected at a media boundary as a function of incidence angle, but their complexity obscure insight into the problem at hand. For that reason, Andreas Rüger’s (1997) approximation for the P-wave reflectivity in horizontally isotropic media is introduced in 2. 6. 1. Two approaches for inverting this equation for the symmetry axis orientation are outlined in the same section. The AVOA signature can be obscured by several error factors which vary with azimuth and/or wavefront normal angle. These include ghost effects, attenuation, source array directivity and heterogeneous/anisotropic overburdens. Brief explanations of these phenomena are given in 2. 6. 2. In 2. 7, the theory behind some of the processing applied to the seismic data in this thesis is explained – Kirchhoff migration and noise removal through f-x deconvolution and f-k filtering. Finishing off chapter two is {{a brief description of the}} finite element model ISAMGEO and the modeling software mech 2 seis. This software package, with the ISAMGEO-model as input, was used to model AVOA-effects to be compared with observed data. Chapter 3 contains the complete description of the practical work in this thesis. The first part summarizes the seismic data preprocessing and the AVOA attribute calculation and extraction along the horizons THC and Top Balder, figures of with common offset/midpoint gathers from every processing step and AVO/AVA plots. The second part of Chapter 3 describes the comparing of the extracted AVOA attributes along the horizons THC and Top Balder with: 1. Direction of maximum modeled stress. Theoretically, the direction of maximum stress is approximately equal to the isotropy plane orientation. 2. Unidirectionality of modeled stress. Large maximum stress compared to minimum stress could create small fractures and microcracks aligned in the direction of maximum stress. Also, the alignment of open fracturing can be influenced by the stress field if the maximum stress is significantly larger than the minimum stress – Cracks oriented orthogonal to the maximum stress direction may close, while cracks oriented parallel to the maximum stress direction may open. This will cause azimuthal anisotropy in the <b>form</b> of <b>birefringence.</b> 3. Modeled maximum stress magnitude difference across the interfaces. A certain difference in stress magnitude across the interface may be needed to induce measurable azimuthal anisotropy. 4. Modeled AVOA-effects. Synthetic AVO gradients were computed from modeled stress, density and velocity in an effort to match the observed AVO gradients. These comparisons confirmed a relationship between modeled stress and AVOA-effects, particularly at reservoir level, and the modeling of the AVO gradient indicated that the azimuthal anisotropy on Valhall is mainly caused by differences in the shear wave splitting parameter difference, Δγ, which points to that the azimuthal anisotropy could be caused by near-vertical fractures. Chapter 4 features a general discussion of the methodology and conclusions from the three comparisons between modeled and observed data, as well as a discussion of the relevance for using AVOA as an indicator of reservoir depletion based on data from a single survey. Input parameters for all figures, acquisition parameters, and PGS preprocessing are summarized in three tables in Appendix A, while Appendix B contains all MATLAB functions written for computing the AVO gradients from mech 2 seis output. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this work, hyperbranched {{polymers}} {{of different}} molecular weights and different molecular architectures have been simulated using a coarse-grained model and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics techniques. A number of structural parameters and the rheology of hyperbranched polymer melts under shear were analysed {{to explain the}} effect of the molecular structure and molecular weight on microscopic as well as macroscopic properties. In order to determine the shear-induced changes in the structural properties of hyperbranched polymers, various parameters were calculated at different strain rates. The radii of gyration which characterize the size of the polymer were evaluated. The relationship between the zero shear rate mean squared radius of gyration and the molecular weight as well as the Wiener index was established. The tensor of gyration was analysed and results indicate that hyperbranched polymer molecules have a prolate ellipsoid shape under shear. As hyperbranched polymers have compact, highly branched architecture and layers of beads have increasing densities which might lead to an unusual distribution of mass, the distribution of beads was also studied. The distribution of terminal beads was investigated to understand the spatial arrangement of these groups which is very important for hyperbranched polymer applications, especially in drug delivery. Flow birefringence was characterized by taking into account both <b>form</b> and intrinsic <b>birefringences</b> which result from molecular and bond alignment respectively. The melt rheology of hyperbranched polymer structures with different molecular weights and different number of spacers was also studied. Systems were simulated over a wide range of strain rates to capture the crossover behaviour from Newtonian to non-Newtonian regimes. Rheological properties including the shear viscosity and first and second normal stress coefficients were computed and the transition to shear thinning was observed at different strain rates for hyperbranched polymers of different sizes and topologies. The results were consistent with findings from NEMD simulations of linear and dendritic polymers. The stress-optical rule was tested and shown to be valid only in the Newtonian regime and violated in the strong flow regime where the rule {{does not take into account}} flow-induced changes of the micro structure. The stress-optical coefficient was found to be independent of the molecular weight and topology of polymers. Blends of hyperbranched polymers and linear polymers were also simulated and their rheological properties were investigated. Results show that even a small proportion of hyperbranched polymer in a melt of linear chains can reduce the shear viscosity of the whole system. This feature makes hyperbranched polymers a potential candidate as rheology modifiers. However there is no observed limit in the proportion of hyperbranched polymers in the samples above which the viscosity is stabilized. The viscosity drops continuously, correlating with the amount of hyperbranched polymers present...|$|R
