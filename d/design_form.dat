25|$|In 2017, Mayor Sly James re-initiated the {{conversation}} for Kansas City's potential new terminal. Local <b>design</b> <b>form</b> Burns & McDonnell proactively proposed a privately funded option {{that would not}} require new public taxes. (Even if not privately funded, airport reconstruction would {{be paid for by}} takeoff and landing fees generated by the airport, not a separate tax initiative). Initially Burns & McDonnell were the only firm to present a privately funded option. In June 2017, Airport design firm AECOM also approached Kansas City to advise they would also submit a privately funded proposal. On July 18th 2017, two new teams emerged to submit proposals to the city for a new terminal.|$|E

2500|$|The St Kilda Football Club Crest first {{appeared}} officially on the jumper in approximately 1933 after existing {{at the club}} {{for quite some time}} beforehand in basic <b>design</b> <b>form.</b> In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a [...] "vest" [...] style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers - which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.|$|E

40|$|A panel-hinge {{framework}} is a {{structure composed of}} rigid panels connected by hinges. It was recently proved that for a so-called generic position, the rigidity of panel-hinge frameworks can be tested by examining the combinatorial property of the underlying graph. In this study, we apply such combinatorial characteristics to create <b>design</b> <b>forms.</b> However, such characterization is only valid for so-called "generic" panel-hinge frameworks. When considering the application of <b>design</b> <b>forms,</b> {{we need to take}} into account non-generic cases. In this paper, we develop the method to inductively generate non-generic rigid panel-hinge frameworks consisting of orthogonal panels and to inductively generate rigid panel-hinge frameworks based on fractal geometry coupled with space filling 3 -dimensional convex polyhedron as a construction unit. We give examples of forms by the proposed method to demonstrate the applicability to <b>design</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
