5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E
5|$|The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act {{establishes}} the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also establishes {{and sets the}} charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State's rail network. As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act, {{the responsibilities of the}} <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority, a major initiative of the Bailieu Government.|$|E

She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
5|$|After {{football}} and marriage, Bomar was assistant {{manager of the}} Colonial Hotel in Springfield, Tennessee for seven years.He sold life insurance, but found it dull. Bomar then began a long career in law enforcement, beginning in the United States Marshals Service office from 1934 to 1939. In 1939 he became a division chief with the Knoxville Highway Patrol {{and a year later}} became <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> safety, overseeing the city's police and fire departments. For a few months the public-safety position was eliminated, and Bomar was again the Highway Patrol division chief. Governor Prentice Cooper promoted him to chief on a trial basis in 1942, when the incumbent went on active duty in World War II.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, {{and the next morning}} the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E

5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions. The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared {{on the morning of}} the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E
5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E

Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked {{him to leave the}} Marines to become the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Safety, the {{official}} in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|In late 1986, {{questions}} were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up {{the issue in the}} House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in Lobster and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its Broadway debut, preview {{performances}} of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in Pittsburgh, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921. It was closed early {{on the last day}} by the local <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Safety, who objected to some of the dialogue. Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from press coverage of the closure. The tryouts then moved to Stamford, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was at the Times Square Theatre on October 18, 1921. It ran there for a few weeks until Woods transferred it to his own Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on November 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
