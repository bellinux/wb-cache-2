5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the <b>Great</b> <b>Mystery</b> creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E

25|$|Pulsars are {{sources of}} {{powerful}} electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses {{many times a}} second. They were a <b>great</b> <b>mystery</b> when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered {{the possibility that it}} could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic field concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.|$|E

[...] These pieces, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, Dante Aligheri, and Giacomo Leopardi (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's Die Gedankenlyrik).

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish {{cardinals}} Solis and de la Cerda on April 27 strengthened the anti-Jesuit party. They also {{violated the law}} of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with Spanish ambassador Azpuru. The Spaniards had fewer scruples than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal Malvezzi, took the matter into their own hands. They paid attention to the only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, O.F.M.Conv. The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a <b>great</b> <b>mystery</b> – he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the pontificate of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. Ganganelli answered that [...] "he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors.|$|E
500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather <b>Great</b> <b>Mystery)</b> will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{recently}} discovered dark energy and its implication on the cosmological constant, Leonard Susskind says [...] "The <b>great</b> <b>mystery</b> is not {{why there is}} dark energy. The <b>great</b> <b>mystery</b> is why {{there is so little}} of it ... The fact that we are just on the knife edge of existence, [...] if dark energy were very much bigger we wouldn’t be here, that's the mystery." [...] A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form. Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the [...] "megaverse" [...] in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.|$|E

2500|$|Britain {{had long}} been known to the {{classical}} world {{as a source of}} tin. The coastline had been explored by the Greek geographer Pytheas in the 4th century BC, and may have been explored even earlier, in the 5th, by the Carthaginian sailor Himilco. But to many Romans, the island, lying as it did beyond the Ocean at what was to them the edge of the [...] "known world," [...] was a land of <b>great</b> <b>mystery.</b> Some Roman writers even insisted that it did not exist, and dismissed reports of Pytheas's voyage as a hoax.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Symington {{revealed}} he was {{a witness}} to the Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting that took place on March 13, 1997, a decade before his admission. In an interview with The Daily Courier, Symington stated, [...] "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a <b>great</b> <b>mystery.</b> Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it." [...] He continued, [...] "It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape." [...] As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.|$|E

2500|$|The role of {{dialectic}} in Plato's {{thought is}} contested {{but there are}} two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is [...] "the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position." [...] A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from Hegel. According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach [...] "the end of history." [...] Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for [...] "visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the <b>Great</b> <b>Mystery</b> behind the common man's everyday world of appearances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chauncey Yellow Robe ("Kills in the Woods") (Canowicakte) {{was born}} {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Montana around 1867, in the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in Lakota or [...] "Burnt Thighs Nation." [...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard my father used to wake me up out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare me to go out and lay down in the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if it was a man or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the <b>Great</b> <b>Mystery.</b> [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E
