25|$|Johnson {{wished to}} be {{regarded}} as an English gentleman, registering his pedigree with the College of Arms. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> three gold parrots on a gold background, and had a crest of a silver Catherine wheel with two parrot wings behind it. Apparently winged crests are common in German heraldry which may show the arms previously used by the family.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 41 he had {{declined}} so far in health that <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{by his own admission}} thin and weak. He suffered from bursitis, possibly aggravated by faulty treatment, arthritis, dermatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease, as well as developing, by his mid-forties, a pronounced limp. How much of this was due to his intake of alcohol is impossible to ascertain, according to Bragg, because of Burton's reluctance to be treated for alcohol addiction. In 1974 Burton spent six weeks in a clinic to recuperate from a period during which he had drunk three bottles of vodka a day. He was also a chain smoker, with an intake of between three and five packs a day for most of his adult life. Health issues continued to plague him until his death of a stroke at the age of 58.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Golding, sheriff of Kent in 1703, {{was living}} in the nearby parish of Leybourne when he bought Ditton Court, around the start of the 18th century. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> [...] "argent, a cross voided between four lions passant, guardant gules" [...] (a red hollow cross between four lions lying down with their heads and front paws up, on a white or silver background). He left Ditton Court to his nephew, another Thomas, who seems to have sold it and then bought it back again around 1735.|$|E

500|$|Ruth {{made one}} final trip {{on behalf of}} American Legion Baseball, then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the {{hospital}} for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [...] "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", Frick said years later.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1686 to 1712) is {{reported}} to have spent £1,000 during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, particularly in the chancel (at the east end), but also including the addition of a screen separating {{the main part of the}} chapel from the ante-chapel (at the west end) in 1693. The screen bears the coat of arms of Sir Leoline Jenkins (principal 1661–1673) and, until 1899, also bore Thelwall's coat of arms. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> moved to a position above the door (where, says one writer, [...] "they can scarcely be seen") when an organ by J. J. Binns was installed in the ante-chapel in 1899. The current organ, by William Drake, was installed in 1994 to replace the Binns organ. The screen has open ovals rather than blank ovals– an example, said Pevsner, of [...] "the importance given to openwork carving" [...] in the later 17th century. After the installation of the screen, little changed in the chapel until the middle of the 19th century, save for some donations of items such as a brass desk and two silver candlesticks.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{two centuries}} after his death. Donnelly remains {{the subject of}} urban legend. One contends {{that he had the}} longest arms in boxing history, with the ability to touch his knees without bending down. Another claims that he was knighted by the Prince Regent. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{actually}} of normal length for a man of his size. [...] No known documentation exists to support the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Like many ancient {{educational}} foundations, St Paul's School traditionally {{used the}} arms of its founder, John Colet. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> Sable on a chevron Argent between three Hinds trippant Argent three Annulets Sable, and they were originally used by his great-grandfather, Richard Colet. [...] As Dean of St Paul's, he was entitled to impale them with {{the arms of}} the Deanery, and the school has often used them in this form also. [...] In 2002, the school obtained its own grant of arms from the College of Arms consisting of the arms of Dean Colet surrounded by a gold bordure, upon which the crossed swords of the Dean of St Paul's are repeated.|$|E

2500|$|Larry Hope, {{an inmate}} at Limestone Prison, was punished by the {{hitching}} post on two occasions. [...] On May 11, 1995, Hope {{was working on}} a chain gang near an interstate highway when he got into an argument with another inmate. [...] Both men were chained to the hitching post. [...] Because Hope was only slightly taller than the hitching post, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> above shoulder height and grew tired from being handcuffed so high. [...] Whenever he tried to move his arms to improve his circulation, the handcuffs cut into his wrists. [...] Guards came by every 15 minutes to offer him water and a bathroom break, and Hope's responses were recorded in a log. [...] Hope was let go two hours later when it was determined that the other man initiated the argument.|$|E
2500|$|The Muslims met the Byzantines at Muta, {{where they}} were heavily outnumbered. Zayd ibn Harithah {{was among the first}} Muslims to be killed in the battle, and Ja’far then took over his {{standard}} and assumed command. Mounted on his horse, he penetrated deep into the Byzantine ranks. As he spurred his horse on, he called out: “How wonderful is Paradise as it draws near! How pleasant and cool is its drink! Punishment for the Byzantines is not far away!” Ja’far fought until both <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> cut off, but he was eventually killed. “A Roman struck him and cut him in two halves. One half fell on the grape vine, and roughly thirty wounds were found on it.” “The body of Ja’far held seventy-two scars between his shoulders, where he had been either struck by a sword or pierced by a spear.” ...|$|E
