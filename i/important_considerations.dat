5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are <b>important</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|E

The protection, management, authenticity and integrity of properties are also <b>important</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Widespread {{commercial}} {{applications of}} {{friction stir welding}} process for steels and other hard alloys such as titanium alloys will require the development of cost-effective and durable tools. Material selection, design and cost are <b>important</b> <b>considerations</b> {{in the search for}} commercially useful tools for the welding of hard materials. Work is continuing to better understand the effects of tool material's composition, structure, properties and geometry on their performance, durability and cost.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} whether worker wasps {{will leave the}} nest. <b>Important</b> <b>considerations</b> include temperature, light intensity, {{and the existence of}} other wasps. Relative humidity and atmospheric pressure do not affect V. rufas decision of whether or not to leave the nest. Orientation flights occur so that V. rufa can familiarize themselves with the entrance to their nest and recognize it when they return. By removing roadblocks, V. rufa would be able to enter and exit more smoothly.|$|E

25|$|One area {{in which}} {{population}} categories can be <b>important</b> <b>considerations</b> in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. Association studies can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that {{are not related to}} the disease being studied, although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate. Various techniques detect and account for population substructure, but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the thyroid}} clinic, Campos {{likewise}} pursued research on {{whether there was}} a genetic factor that contributed to endemic goiter. His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961, proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of goiter {{was just one of the}} triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more <b>important</b> <b>considerations</b> as some people were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine even if it were present in food and water.|$|E
25|$|Mehmed II's first campaigns after Constantinople {{were in the}} {{direction}} of Serbia, which had been an Ottoman vassal state since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The Ottoman ruler had a connection with the Serbian Despotate – one of Murad II's wives was Mara Branković – and he used that fact to claim some Serbian islands. That Đurađ Branković had recently made an alliance with the Hungarians, and had paid the tribute irregularly, may have been <b>important</b> <b>considerations.</b> When Serbia refused these demands, the Ottoman army set out from Edirne towards Serbia in 1454. Smederevo was besieged, as was Novo Brdo, the most important Serbian metal mining and smelting center. Ottomans and Hungarians fought during the years till 1456.|$|E
