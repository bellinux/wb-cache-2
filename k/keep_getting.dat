As well as being a box office hit, the musical was also a critical success, winning five Tony Awards; Best Authors (Musical), Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Musical and Best Producers (Musical). The play has since been revived numerous times in various countries. Its 1999 revival at the Martin Beck Theatre, directed by Michael Blakemore and starring Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell, was especially successful, winning another five Tonys; Best Actor (Musical), Best Costume Design, Best Director (Musical), Best Orchestrations, and Best Revival (Musical).|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave).

[...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just <b>keep</b> <b>getting</b> worse from here.".

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "I saw [...] "Subway Hero" [...] a while back, and as I wrote in my column last week, my {{reaction}} to it was roughly {{the same as it was}} to [...] "MILF Island": a number of very funny individual moments, but an episode that was less than the sum of its parts."

His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, [...] "If I'm gonna be in it, I want to be in it." [...] He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a double agent. He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.|$|E

2500|$|Matt Risley of Total Film {{gave the}} film 5 stars and wrote: [...] "Sumptuously shot, {{perfectly}} paced and flat-out exhilarating, The Raid 2 cements Evans {{as the best}} action director working today {{and may not be}} the best action, gangster, or even martial-arts movie ever made. But as a combination of all three, it's unparalleled in recent memory and offers a tantalising glimpse into a post-Bayhem action-movie world. Brutal, beautiful and brilliant" [...] and also wrote, [...] "The sheer imagination on show, both in the cinematography and choreography, guarantees each brawl is instantly iconic. Immaculately edited, each traumatic, tensely tactile fight would blur into chaos if not for Evans's pinpoint pacing something that refreshes all the more in the face of modern blockbusting's tendency to start big and just <b>keep</b> <b>getting</b> bigger, until burnout." ...|$|E
