60|$|These {{words were}} uttered hastily in broken exclamations, as Macgregor seized the logs {{that had been}} cut for firewood, and began violently to toss them {{together}} in a pile; while the trappers, although much amazed and horrified at the news, seized their hatchets and began to make <b>instant</b> <b>preparation</b> to resist an attack, without wasting time in useless questions. They observed that {{the commander of the}} Mountain Fort was pale as death, that his eyes were bloodshot, his clothes torn, and his hands and face begrimed with powder and stained with blood.|$|E
60|$|It was {{remarkable}} in the raven {{that during the}} whole interview he had kept his eye on his book with exactly {{the air of a}} very sly human rascal, who, under the mask of pretending to read hard, was listening to everything. He still appeared to have the conversation very strongly in his mind, for although, when they were alone again, he issued orders for the <b>instant</b> <b>preparation</b> of innumerable kettles for purposes of tea, he was thoughtful, and rather seemed to do so from an abstract sense of duty, than with any regard to making himself agreeable, or being what is commonly called good company.|$|E

5000|$|In the First Olynthiac, Demosthenes exhorted the Athenians to vote an {{expedition}} at once, to make <b>instant</b> <b>preparation</b> for its dispatch and to send ambassadors to state their intentions and watch events. He then proposed {{the reform of}} the [...] "theoric fund" [...] ("Theorika" [...] were allowances paid {{by the state to}} poor Athenians to enable them to watch dramatic festivals). In the Second Olynthiac, the orator bluntly expressed his annoyance for the dubious stance of his countrymen and for the fact that they remain idle. He also insisted that Philip was not invincible. In the Third Olynthiac he insulted Philip, characterizing him as a [...] "barbarian" [...] and warned his compatriots that the King of Macedon is quick to seize his opportunity, now yielding a point when it suits his purpose. He called for two distinct expeditions; one military force must be dispatched to rescue the Olynthians, and a second force, both naval and military, to ravage Philip's territory. He finally demanded a better utilization of the public money for the attainment of success abroad. Despite Demosthenes' warnings, the Athenians engaged in a useless war in Euboea and offered no military support to Olynthus. When they decided to implement some of his suggestions, the timing was wrong and their troops were inadequate.|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{trend for}} {{the consumption of}} natural products has been the pattern {{for the start of}} this project, Fruit Tea made from concentrated fruit pulp mixed with green tea, resulting in an excellent aromatic beverage, hot, sweetened and varied flavors. The product is an <b>instant</b> <b>preparation,</b> a hundred percent natural, with exquisite flavor and aroma, and completely innovative; it represents a potential alternative for consumers of hot beverages, natural and healthy. As an advantage, it has the accessibility of a company, PALFRUIT, food plant, dedicated to the production of fruit pulp, which provides operating resources in place, speeding up project implementation and with minimal financial investment. The project represents a big attraction for the diversification of the company with the launch of a new product, contributing to innovation of the production line derived from the fruit pulp and exploits the installed capacity by increasing the occupancy of the lines. Finally, Ecuador is rich in natural resources and abundant production of fruit, which gives the opportunity to create a variety of fruit products, use natural resources and promoting agro industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} making a cake in the modern era, {{demanding}} speed {{because of the time}} more valuable and more widely distribution coverage, which means greater production capacity. Then the process is made as efficient as possible.

The process is also very clear instructions printed on the packaging of instant flour. From the results of analysis of Material Differences between Normal and Instant Ingredients (Paired Samples Correlations) then we can see the differences, views of significant value. If sig is smaller than 0 : 05, the materials A and B materials are different, but if the sig is greater than 0 : 05, the materials A and B, have same material. From the above table can be viewed texture and flavor of the cake A and B are different, while for the smell, taste, and colors have in common. So it can be concluded that between the two cakes A and B are same.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum porridge, {{sold as a}} {{fast food}} {{on the streets of}} the West African village of Dan Boulde, Niger? That is the goal of Purdue cereal chemist Bruce Hamaker and his {{graduate}} student Moussa Moustapha. Yes, these scientists are developing a process to speed up the arduous process of food preparation, such as the traditional West African tô from sorghum flour. Why an instant sorghum food? The process of preparing many of the traditional foods is time consuming. West African women have many duties and don’t have the energy to spend hours preparing a meal after a day of weeding in the fields. What can be done? Instant foods! In addition to saving time and labor for women, an instant sorghum based food can be sold by street vendors and consumed on the street. It also increases the demand for locally grown sorghum which in turn lessens the need for foreign exchange to import wheat. So what is Dr. Hamaker’s strategy to meet the labor and health demands of the West African population and at the same time to contribute to the economic health of West African countries? Among several strategies in Dr. Hamaker’s arsenal, one is to develop “pregelatinized” sorghum flour which can be used in <b>instant</b> <b>preparations</b> of traditional foods...|$|R
50|$|Advantages {{of instant}} coffee include speed of <b>preparation</b> (<b>instant</b> coffee dissolves quickly in hot water), lower {{shipping}} weight and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare {{the same amount}} of beverage), and long shelf life—though instant coffee can spoil if not kept dry. Instant coffee also reduces cleanup since there are no coffee grounds, and at least one study has found that it has a lower environmental footprint than other preparation methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Sensitivity {{threshold}} of salt taste values from aqueous solutions of sodium chloride or <b>instant</b> rice-cream <b>preparations,</b> together to the corresponding response to stimulus vs. NaCl concentration functions {{were evaluated by}} panel-test method (18 volunteers) were evaluated in different conditions, that is: two different (8 - 9 °C) environment temperatures, addition of fixed amounts of sweeteners (sucrose or Aspartame) and in a 800 meters on s. l. place vs. 0 meters on s. l [...] Baseline values agree with literature data. Sucrose or aspartame, at experimented concentrations caused slight but not negligible threshold values lowering with respect these values. Increase of 8 - 9 °C caused in every case a marked enhancement of the threshold values. The functions of response vs. concentration of NaCl gave non linearly increasing trends, but {{in agreement with the}} above data. Finally, minor sensitivity of salt taste was obtained in experiments carried out at 800 mt on s. l. with respect to those at 0 mt on s. l.

40|$|Vitex trifolia or locally {{known as}} lemuni, is well documented/or its {{medicinal}} properties including anticancer, antibacterial and wound healing. For years, {{the leaves and}} flowers were consumed for anti-aging and general well-being. It is also commonly served as nutraceuticals to post-partum women during their confinement period. Previous study showed that V. trifolia possesses high antioxidant properties that could prevent oxidative stress related diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes and many more. From the literature, V. trifolia leaves are used as poultice for rheumatic pains, sprains, antithelmintics and inflammations. Meanwhile, the fruits are utilised in amenorrhea. The roots, on the other hand, are used {{for the treatment of}} cough and fever. The plant is known to possess pharmacologically-active constituents such as the essential oil, halimanetype diterpenes, flavonoids, triterpenes, lignans, iridoids and ecdysteroids. Review papers were consistently published to justify the non-exhaustive biological exploration of this genus. Nevertheless, only 11 per cent of the total Vitex species were phytochemically examined. Apart from being eaten raw or blanched, Vitex is also taken as a food colourant in preparing lemuni rice. The process of making lemuni rice is quite tedious. First, the leaves and flowers are picked and washed. Both parts are then ground with water and sieved to give a bluish extract which is then mixed with rice and boiled to cook Hence, the Vitex pouch is introduced to provide an easy way to prepare lemuni rice. This packaging is designed to enclose Vitex samples in a pouch that simply can be placed together with rice and boiled to cook Such <b>instant</b> <b>preparation</b> will hopefully promote the consumption oflemuni rice among busy locals. Future plans include international marketing and production of other Vitex nutritional products...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{amounts of}} wastes are {{generated}} by the coffee industry, among of which, coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the most abundantly generated during the beans roasting and <b>instant</b> coffee <b>preparation,</b> respectively. This study evaluated the sugars metabolism and production of ethanol by three different yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia stipitis and Kluyveromyces fragilis) when cultivated in sugar rich hydrolysates produced by acid hydrolysis of CS and SCG. S. cerevisiae provided the best ethanol production from SCG hydrolysate (11. 7 g/l, 50. 2 % efficiency). On the other hand, insignificant (<= 1. 0 g/l) ethanol production was obtained from CS hydrolysate, for all the evaluated yeast strains, {{probably due to the}} low sugars concentration present in this medium (approx. 22 g/l). It was concluded {{that it is possible to}} reuse SCG as raw material for ethanol production, which is of great interest for the production of this biofuel, as well as to add value to this agro-industrial waste. CS hydrolysate, in the way that is produced, was not a suitable fermentation medium for ethanol production; however, the hydrolysate concentration for the sugars content increase previous the use as fermentation medium could be an alternative to overcome this problem.

40|$|AbstractDifructose {{anhydride}} III (DFA III) {{has been}} known as a non-calorie sweetener and reported to stimulate absorption and increase calcium as well as density of bone. The aim of this work was to prepare instant ginger drinks for bone health by addition of DFA III into different formulas of instant ginger-milk drink {{and to find out}} the acceptability of the formulas as well as its physicochemical properties of the most preferable formula. The experiment was started with <b>instant</b> ginger <b>preparation</b> followed by formulation. Six formulas consist of a constant concentration of DFA III and different concentrations of instant ginger, skim milk, vegetable creamer, and calcium lactate were developed. Organoleptic hedonic test was performed by involving 30 panellists. The results showed that the preference of panellist to flavour, aroma and colour was ranging from 11 to 44 %, 11 - 44 % and 22 - 44 %, consecutively. Formula F 6 which contains of 25 g instant ginger, 9. 375 g of skim milk, 6. 25 g vegetable creamer, 0, 385 g calcium lactate, and 5 g of DFA III was indicated as the most favourable formula with the same highest preference values (44. 4 %) for colour, aroma, and taste compared to other formulas. Physicochemical analysis results also demonstrated that F 6 has suitable characteristics mainly in terms of solubility, hygroscopicity, as well as water content...|$|R
