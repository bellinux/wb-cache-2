5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{has set a}} record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science <b>Express</b> <b>that</b> the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable {{to the age of}} the universe.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient <b>Express</b> <b>that</b> Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In 263, {{after his}} return, Odaenathus assumed the title King of Kings of the East (Mlk Mlk), {{and headed to}} Antioch, the {{traditional}} capital of Syria, where he crowned his son Hairan I as co-King of Kings. The title {{was a symbol of}} legitimacy in the East, starting with the Assyrians then the Achaemenids who used it to symbolize their supremacy over all other rulers and was adopted by the Parthian monarchs following their defeat of the Seleucids to legitimize their conquests. The first Sassanian monarch Ardashir I adopted the title following his victory over the Parthians. Odaenathus' son was crowned with a diadem and a tiara; the choice of the location was probably meant to <b>express</b> <b>that</b> the Palmyrene monarchs were now the successors of the Seleucid and Iranian rulers who controlled Syria and Mesopotamia in the past.|$|E
