5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are <b>justified</b> by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be <b>justified.</b> A prediction of a transit of Venus is <b>justified</b> by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

The album earned Timberlake four Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. <b>Justified</b> debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold 439,000 copies in its first week.

40|$|People use {{arguments}} to <b>justify</b> their claims. Computer systems use explanations to <b>justify</b> their conclusions. User {{acceptance of a}} system depends partly on how well the system explains its reasoning and <b>justifies</b> its conclusions. We have built WOZ, an explanation framework that <b>justifies</b> the conclusions of a clinical decision-support system. WOZ’s central component is the explanation strategy that decides what information <b>justifies</b> a claim. The strategy uses Toulmin’s argument structure to define pieces of explanatory information and to orchestrate their presentation. WOZ uses explicit models that abstract the core aspects of the framework such as the explanation strategy. In this paper, we present the use of arguments, the modeling of explanations, and the explanation proces...|$|R

5|$|Disraeli <b>justified</b> {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the {{different}} classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli <b>justified</b> his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

I present my own account of justification for pursuit and show how analogies on this account can <b>justify</b> pursuit independently of whether they can also <b>justify</b> acceptance...|$|R
