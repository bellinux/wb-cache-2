The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, {{is an example of a}} fiduciary fund.

5|$|Size {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.|$|E

5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
5|$|Among other points, the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected {{targets and}} equal effectiveness against protected targets. It also cited less sensitivity to extreme temperatures for the 5.7×28mm, and cited a greater potential risk of barrel erosion with the 4.6×30mm. In addition, the group {{pointed out that}} 5.7×28mm {{is close to the}} 5.56×45mm NATO by its design and manufacture process, allowing it to be manufactured on existing production lines. The group also noted that 5.7×28mm firearms had existed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of time than 4.6×30mm firearms, and that the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol was already in production at that time, while the 4.6×30mm Heckler & Koch UCP pistol was a new concept.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of time.|$|E

5|$|By then, Farnese, unwilling {{of having}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> time his troops close to Antwerp's cannons, made drums and {{trumpets}} {{to call for}} withdrawal and gathered his men at Borgerhout. Meanwhile, people from Antwerp sallied to carry the wounded French, British and Walloon officers and soldiers into the city to receive treatment. The Spanish soldiery, once the fire of Borgerhout was finished, looted the basements of the burned buildings and had a meal before praying to thank God. After that, the Spanish Army marched across the roads of Lier and Herentals to Turnhout, where Farnese wanted to arrive the next day. Fearing a new attack, Antwerp's civic guards {{spent the night at}} their posts.|$|E
5|$|Carmella {{was created}} {{following}} Delta Goodrem's sudden departure from Neighbours due to illness. Three months' worth of scripts were rewritten, and Carmella {{was introduced to}} fill the void left by Goodrem's character, Nina Tucker. As a school graduate, Blair had unsuccessfully auditioned for another role in the serial, but impressed casting director Jan Russ. Six months later, Russ contacted Blair and asked her to audition for the role of Carmella. She was cast immediately, due to the urgent need {{to fill the void}} left by Goodrem. She played Carmella on an episodic basis in 2003, then returned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period in 2004, and briefly in 2005. Blair returned to Neighbours in 2006, and in September 2007, signed a contract keeping her in the show for another year.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> delay, {{as long as the}} reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{undertook}} {{a wave of}} castle-building during his visit in 1171 to protect his new territories—the Anglo-Normans had superior military technologies to the Irish, and castles gave them a significant advantage. Henry hoped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> term political solution, however, similar to his approach in Wales and Scotland, and in 1175 he agreed to the Treaty of Windsor, under which Rory O'Connor would be recognised as the high king of Ireland, giving homage to Henry and maintaining stability on the ground on his behalf. This policy proved unsuccessful, as O'Connor was unable to exert sufficient influence and force {{in areas such as}} Munster: Henry instead intervened more directly, establishing a system of local fiefs of his own through a conference held in Oxford in 1177.|$|E
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E

5|$|In May 1840, Etty {{finally made}} the trip to Brussels and Antwerp {{which he had been}} forced by {{revolution}} to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> visit to visit St. Rumbold's Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist habit; he also bought a Capuchin habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the RAAF has {{implemented}} several {{measures to}} keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of fatigue-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the Defence Science and Technology Group conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' structural condition which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the ageing aircraft in service has been increasing.|$|E
