We first examine the implied present-value multipliers for seven distinct fiscal instruments and show that the estimated complementarities result in fiscal multipliers larger than one for government consumption and investment. We highlight the importance of monetary accommodation for these findings.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{focussed}} {{on the financial}} packages and <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>measures</b> taken by EU as a group and by each EU country for supporting hard-hit sectors like automotive industry, tourism and construction. The economic crisis from 2008 - 2009 {{has led to a}} sharp decrease of investment climate and a massive contraction of economic activity. This means a sharp decrease of capacity utilisation that had led in time to an excessive unemployment especially in the most hit sectors. The financial rescue measures of EU are comprised in European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP). Measures approved are different from country to country, depending by the political support and the strategy chosen by the government. The EU's response to support the real economy during the economic crisis has been taken very fast and well-organized in certain countries and industries. By contrary, some Member States' recovery measures has been approved late and the rescue strategy wasn’t enough achieved. This has led to a deepening of financial instability and unemployment. ...|$|R

40|$|Prepared for Catholic Social Services Australia, Anglicare Australia, The Salvation Army and UnitingCare Australia, {{this paper}} {{analyses}} {{the impact of}} the global financial crisis on Australia’s social services sector and discusses the implications of this for future policy responses.   The demand for social services is already rising and will rise substantially in the short-term. In many areas — examples include residential aged care, housing, homelessness and family relationship services — demand already outstrips the capacity of agencies to offer assistance. The services most immediately affected by deteriorating economic conditions are in employment, housing, financial and general counselling and emergency relief. In addition to being the response of a genuinely civil society, high quality, social services {{are an integral part of}} a productive economy. Investment in such services is a benefit not just to those in such desperate need of services, but also reduces long term social costs and enhances the overall productivity of the economy.

40|$|The {{unfolding}} {{global economic}} debacle {{has led many}} governments, including our own, to reach into their policy toolkits for <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>measures.</b> In doing so, they have revived fiscal policy as a counter-cyclical tool, which was so much in vogue until the early 1970 s that Richard Nixon famously declared 2 ̆ 7 We are all Keynesians now. 2 ̆ 7 Are we all Keynesians again? At first sight, fiscal pump priming might {{appear to have a}} lot going for it in current conditions: inflation is receding; spare capacity is increasing, at least in the major developed economies; and the crisis in the banking system is weakening conventional monetary policy. Even so, the revival of activist fiscal policy ought to be highly controversial because the 1970 s and 1980 s saw a new consensus emerge that it was ineffective or even damaging. The lessons from that era remain valid today but are being ignored by governments desperate to prop up sagging economies.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2008 – 09 has cast {{a long and}} wide shadow over the world economy. Financial disruptions in advanced economies, triggered by the bursting of housing bubbles, spilled over quickly into the real economy. They then crossed borders to impact emerging market economies, {{many of which were}} innocent bystanders. During the concerted policy responses to deal with the crisis, official interest rates in many countries were cut to near zero, while large-scale <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>measures</b> were deployed. Another Great Depression was avoided thanks to these policy responses, but the {{global financial}} crisis has yet to give way again to normality. The economic recoveries in Europe and the United States are still faltering, with growth anemic and unemployment high even three years since the crisis erupted.

30|$|A further {{concern in}} the policy debate put forward by {{supporters}} of large and coordinated discretionary measures was that countries could limit {{the size of their}} programs at the expense of countries with more generous fiscal policy responses. The central factor behind this hypothesis is the degree of openness of an economy. The more open an economy is, i.e. the stronger the economic ties with other countries are, {{the more likely it is}} that a country gains from other countries’ <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> packages or, conversely, the more likely it is that own <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>measures</b> spill over to other countries. Hence, the idea behind this argument is that some countries might show a free-rider behavior and profit from spill-over effects of discretionary measures 15. We find only weak evidence for this hypothesis. While the correlation between discretionary measures passed in 2008 - 2009 and trade openness is negative which is confirmed when we estimate a univariate regression between these two 16, the coefficient on openness becomes insignificant once our measure for automatic stabilization is included as can be seen in column (6) of Table 1. This is due to the fact that the correlation between openness and automatic stabilization is positive. All in all, our results suggest that policymakers did take into account the forces of automatic stabilizers when designing active fiscal policy measures to tackle the recent economic crisis.|$|R
40|$|In {{this period}} of {{economic}} uncertainty, tax scholars must examine income tax policy from a macroeconomic perspective. The standard lenses of efficiency and equity no longer suffice. To highlight {{the importance of the}} macroeconomic perspective, this Article demonstrates that most tax expenditures are procyclical, exacerbating the business cycle. Tax expenditures effectively offer government subsidies for certain activities, such as charitable giving or home purchases. Because these activities vary with the business cycle, tax expenditures are higher at business cycle peaks than at business cycle troughs. The more a given activity varies in tandem with the business cycle, the greater the procyclicality of the tax expenditure. While recent income tax and government spending policies have been explicitly devoted to stimulating the economy, the destabilizing impact of tax expenditures quietly negate much of the impact of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>measures.</b> Our inability to discern tax expenditures 2 ̆ 7 hidden destabilizing impact is symptomatic of a general neglect of macroeconomics in income tax policy.

We calculate the change in the structural balance between the pre-crisis year 2007 and the average for the years 2008 - 11 in order to focus on the endogenous response of fiscal policy to the economic crisis 10. Higher values of this measure of active fiscal policy indicate larger fiscal packages. We also distinguish discretionary fiscal policies in the years 2008 - 2009 and 2010 - 2011 given that fiscal policy changed substantially in some countries {{in the course of the}} crisis.
