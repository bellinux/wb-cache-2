5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished...

The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't want to <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> [...] in the cupboard, and yet at the same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Arfa {{spent most}} of his {{rehabilitation}} in his home city of Paris recuperating at the Clairefontaine (football) academy. In January 2011, it was reported by the English media that Ben Arfa had undergone another surgery in November 2010 to repair complications that were preventing his shin bones from healing properly. On 23 February, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew confirmed that Ben Arfa was running and could return to the team in April. However, days later, Pardew revealed that he wasn't prepared to rush the player's rehabilitation process and that Ben Arfa probably wouldn't be available until May, stating [...] "I am going to protect him. I can't <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> him in". Ben Arfa returned to training with Newcastle on 5 April. He participated fully in warm-ups with the first-team, but spent the majority of the training session doing light training and fitness work. Ben Arfa ultimately failed to make any more appearances with the team in the 2010–11 season.|$|E
500|$|Bates {{called the}} {{recording}} process [...] "seamless" [...] {{because of the}} unconventional studio environment. Manson, isolated in a vocal booth {{with no more than}} three people in the control room at any one time, was free to improvise or develop new lyrics and vocal melodies at a high speed. By using Pro Tools, Bates was able to [...] "manipulate the music {{in a way that would}} allow [...] to just keep working on it without causing [...] If he had an idea, he could <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> it down without there being a lot to explain." [...] The majority of the album was recorded during a three-month period. The band's manager, Tony Ciulla, only became aware that Manson had been recording new material when he was invited to Bates' home recording studio, where Bates played final cuts of nine of the album's ten tracks; [...] "Cupid Carries a Gun" [...] was the only track not yet completed. With the base tracks recorded, overdubbing took place over the following six months between Manson's acting commitments on Sons of Anarchy and Bates scoring the 2014 television series Salem.|$|E

500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling.

500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record.

I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles.

500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You <b>just</b> <b>throw</b> your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending [...] "abrupt and incoherent" [...] and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending.
