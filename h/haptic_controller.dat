The multi-link design presented in this thesis is modular such that the length of the endoscope can be easily modified for different applications. The final prototype contains 7 endoscope units, has a mass of 157 g, is 0. 91 m long and 15 mm in diameter. Each endoscope unit contributes 2 degrees of freedom to the robot; altogether, the current design has 14 degrees of freedom and is capable of navigating through convoluted paths while minimizing physical contact with the surrounding walls. The single-axis <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> designed to drive the robot consists of a user input interface and a motor feedback system.

40|$|A human {{operator}} performing a manual control task can be assisted by haptic shared control, {{a novel approach}} in literature which makes use of a continuous-time force feedback to guide the operator in a specific control direction. In a previous research, a <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> has been designed and tested in a for curve negotiation support in a driving simulator. This support system provides a force feedback the operator has {{to give way to}} in order to correct the vehicle deviations from a reference trajectory. It was proved in an experiment to yield benefits in terms of increased performance and reduced effort from the operator with respect to manual driving. As a variation from the haptic shared control philosophy, a novel approach has been introduced in literature for supporting a {{human operator}} piloting RPVs in a simulated environment. This <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> is called Indirect since the force feedback it provides has the only effect of changing the neutral point of the control interface. The operator can exploit this aiding by contrasting the force feedback and keeping the control device close to the central position. The Indirect <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> was proved in an experiment to increase performance and was found helpful by the pilots, as well as the Direct controller, which is the classic approach, and compared to manual piloting. This novel approach in haptic shared control has only been investigated as a support for piloting RPVs. In this project the Indirect controller is being designed in a modeling study and tested for a curve negotiation task in a driving simulator. The Indirect controller for curve negotiation is designed in a model-based study, where a scheme is employed simulating the behaviour of a human operator and the <b>haptic</b> <b>controller.</b> The outcome of this study are some previsions on different driving conditions, where an operator can drive manually or be assisted by the classic Direct <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> or by the novel Indirect controller. An experimental campaign with a driving simulator is performed, based on the previsions figured in the modeling study. The results of the experiment tells us that both the Direct and Indirect controllers can be helpful for performance and effort of the operator in low visibility conditions, while in normal visibility a contrast in goal can arise between operator and shared controller, due to a different way of the operator to cut curves. In a situation of evasive maneuver with a faulty controller, where the operator has to reject the force feedback, the Indirect controller is proved to be more damaging than the Direct support. Finally, some negative after-effects on performance and effort are encountered after the Indirect controller is switched-off, due to an intense adaptation of the operator to the different dynamics to control. The Indirect haptic support can be a valid alternative to the typical Direct control scheme for curve negotiation support, although there is room for improving its functioning. Future developments should be focused on making the Indirect controller easier to understand, to cope with more effectively in case of failures and possibly to switch to manual driving without confusion...|$|E

40|$|Designing {{transparent}} stabilizing <b>haptic</b> <b>controllers</b> Abstract — This paper {{addresses the}} design of <b>controllers</b> for <b>haptic</b> systems that are both stable and transparent. Stability refers to the property that the control system should not introduce oscillations felt in the haptic device by the human operator. Transparency refers to the property that the haptic system should faithfully reproduce {{the dynamics of the}} virtual environment. We propose a design methodology that converts the problem of maximizing transparency, while guaranteeing stability, into a set of matrix inequalities. Then we propose a numerical procedure to solve the matrix inequalities based on the cone complementarity algorithm. With this formulation one can also incorporate other design tasks, such as robustness to parameter variations, by introducing additional norm conditions and solving H ∞ or mixed norm problems. A numerical example is used to illustrate the design methodology. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There are two popular control methods {{widely used}} in <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> design. First, is {{impedance}} control- the operator motion input is measured, and then, the reaction force is fed back to the operator. The alternative method is admittance control-forces exerted by operator are measured and positions are fed back to the operator. Both, impedance and admittance control are also two basic methods for interacting with a virtual environment. In this paper, several experiments were performed to evaluate the suitability of impedance control with force feedback for haptic interface development. The difference between conventional application of impedance control in robot motion control and its application in haptic interface development is investigated. Open loop impedance control methodology is implemented for static case and a general-purpose robot under open loop impedance control was developed as a haptic device, while a closed loop model based impedance control was used for <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> design in both static and dynamic case. The factors that could affect {{to the performance of}} a haptic interface are also investigated experimentally using parametric studies. The experiments were carried out using an experimental setup.

40|$|Contrary to {{submarine}} control strategies, pilots of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) remain remote to {{the vehicle}} while manoeuvring and manipulating them through their surrounding environments using tele-operation technology and visual feedback interface. However, {{due to the lack}} of three-dimensional (3 D) information and limitations with quality and the field vision of the cameras, ROV pilots are not always able to observe and identify external hazards purely through visual feedback, especially when ROVs operate in environments littered with obstacles, which can thus result in collisions. To avoid such occurrences, a <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> including a tactile user interface was developed for ROVs in order to enhance the operators’ awareness of the working environment and thus improve the performances of the vehicles within such environments. The haptic control technique developed in this project was initially examined within a simulated environment and then applied to control a low-cost open source hardware-based ROV to validate its effectiveness. In the simulation phase, the haptic control interface hardware and software, including the haptic joystick and a novel Artificial Potential Field (APF) technique was developed to assist pilots to safely manoeuvre the simulated ROV through the surrounding environment containing both static and moving obstacles. A robust adaptive control algorithm for the <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> was also developed to improve the performance of the haptic control system while maintaining its stability. The proposed technique was then experimentally validated by applying the <b>haptic</b> <b>controller</b> to an observation class ROV, designed and developed for this project using open source hardware and low-cost equipment. To ensure the quality of the ROV’s haptic drive system, a multi-layer Kalman filter and advanced control algorithms, such as adaptive PID and robust model-based algorithms, were designed to estimate the vehicle’s states and to control its surge, yaw, and heave motions based on a host-target control structure. The experimental results show that the host-target control structure was effectively employed to collect data and control the open source hardware-based ROV in real time. Additionally, the host-target structure was able to overcome the limitation associated with the computational power of the microcontroller, allowing the programmers to develop complex algorithms to process the raw data from low-cost sensors and deal with the nonlinear characteristics of the vehicles. The ROV performances observed from both the simulations and the experimental work indicate that the multi-layer Kalman filter and the adaptive PID algorithms provide acceptable state estimation for the ROV and thus assist the pilot in adequately manoeuvring the vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed APF technique has the ability to model the potential risk presented by both stationary and moving obstacles. The information is fed back and used as reference signals for the force controller incorporated within the haptic joystick system to generate a haptic force, which allows the ROV pilots to ‘feel’ the interaction with the surrounding environment. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that adverse effects, such as parasitic forces and instability caused by model uncertainties and time delays, were effectively mitigated by the robust adaptive force control algorithm. The results and the findings show that haptic technology developed within this project is suitable to assist ROV pilots to safely control the vehicle within hazardous environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the {{majority}} of robotic and haptic applications, including manipulation and human–robot interaction, contact force needs to be monitored and controlled. Transparent implementation of bilateral teleoperation or <b>haptic</b> <b>controllers</b> necessitates the exchange of operator and environment contact forces. This {{requires the use of}} expensive commercially available force/torque sensors, which are rather bulky, are vulnerable to impact forces, and increase system inertia and compliance. An alternative solution is the use of dynamic force observers, which estimate external forces using system dynamic model. However, due to the uncertainties in system dynamic structure and parameters, these model-based observers do not produce accurate force estimates, and often create a dynamic lag that may cause bandwidth limitation and instability. This paper proposes two neural-network-based force/torque observers that do not require a system dynamic model. The observers can estimate human hand force and environment contact force with up to 98. 3 % accuracy in the sense of mean-square error, and with negligible dynamic lag. The performance of the proposed observers are extensively analyzed in separate human–robot and robot–environment experimental settings, and in a two-channel bilateral teleoperation control loop with multiple runs with two Planar Twin-Pantograph haptic devices.

40|$|An {{important}} design {{choice for}} Haptic Shared Control is {{the magnitude of}} assisting forces: high assisting forces are beneficial during agreement between operator and controller, but also result in larger conflict forces in case of disagreement. In order to use higher forces without increasing conflict forces, literature proposes Adaptable Haptic Shared Control: using real-time operator grip force measurements to smoothly scale the magnitude of assisting forces. For full hand grip force no objective measurements comparing Haptic Shared Control versus Adaptable Haptic Shared Control are known and only very limited data on this comparison is available for finger pinching and subjective measurements. In order to prove that, using grip force to adapt the magnitude of assisting forces indeed leads to reduced conflict forces while maintaining the regular Haptic Shared Control performance during agreement, an experiment is required. It is hypothesized that Adaptable Haptic Shared Control will reduce conflict forces during disagreement and that the larger the disagreement the higher the grip force. Both an Adaptable and regular <b>Haptic</b> Shared <b>Controller</b> are designed and implemented on an actuated joystick, which is extended with a 2 D dynamometer to allow real-time grip measurements. Eighteen subjects participated in an experiment where they used the Triar joystick to steer a virtual object along a path consisting of a multisine (agreement) interspersed with straight sections containing obstacles {{that needed to be}} avoided (conflict). After the adaptable and regular haptic shared control condition a Vanderlaan questionnaire was provided to the participant with the question to score them compared to manual control. During the path following task, both the Adaptable <b>Haptic</b> Shared <b>controller</b> and regular <b>haptic</b> shared <b>controller</b> provide similar increased performance in lateral deviation compared to manual control (p< 0. 01). During obstacle avoidance, the Adaptable Haptic shared control significantly decreased conflict forces compared to haptic shared control (p< 0. 01), but at a price of brief increased grip force. No significant difference in grip force was found between obstacles sizes (conflict). The subjective usefulness and satisfying score of adaptable and regular haptic shared control are both positive compared to manual but do not significantly differ from each other. Result show that with Adaptable Haptic Shared Control humans prefer increasing their grip force to lower the Haptic Shared Control forces during disagreement. Additionally during non-conflict situations they maintain the beneficial forces of Haptic Shared Control. Biomechanical Design / BioInspired Technolog...|$|R

Methods: Ten experienced sinus surgeons (five consultants and five registrars) and 14 novices (seven resident medical officers and seven interns/medical students) completed three simulation tasks using <b>haptic</b> <b>controllers.</b> Task 1 required navigation of the sinuses and identification of six anatomical landmarks, Task 2 required removal of unhealthy tissue while preserving healthy tissue and Task 3 entailed backbiting within pre-set lines on the uncinate process and microdebriding tissue between the cuts. Results: Novices were compared with experts {{on a range of}} measures, using Mann– Whitney U-tests. Novices took longer on all tasks (Task 1 : 278 %, P < 0. 005; Task 2 : 112 %, P < 0. 005; Task 3 : 72 %, P < 0. 005). In Task 1, novices’ instruments travelled further than experts’ (379 %, P < 0. 005), and provided greater maximum force (12 %, P < 0. 05). In Tasks 2 and 3 novices performed more cutting movements to remove the tissue (Task 2 : 1500 %, P < 0. 005; Task 3 : 72 %, P < 0. 005). Experts also completed more of Task 3 (66 %, P < 0. 05).

In this document, with purpose of haptic-guided exploration, a new scheme for simultaneous control of force and cartesian position is proposed without using inverse kinematics, and without using the dynamic model of PHANToM, though a strict stability analysis includes the dynamic model of PHANToM. We rely on our previously proposed results to propose a new <b>haptic</b> cartesian <b>controller</b> to reduce the burden of computing cartesian forces in PHANToM. Furthermore, a time base generator for finite-time tracking is also proposed to achieve very fast tracking and high precision, which translated into high fidelity kinaesthetic feedback...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two new {{commercial}} <b>haptic</b> rotary <b>controllers</b> are presented: a Low Cost Rotary Controller (LCRC) and a High Performance Rotary Controller (HPRC). The LCRC {{was developed in}} order to explicitly address the cost constraints of commercial devices while maintaining the haptic fidelity required to render quality detents, and barriers. It consumes {{a fraction of the}} power of standard rotary controllers, and is quite compact (13 mm x 23 mm dia.). The High Performance Rotary Controller (HPRC) was developed to improve the haptic quality over standard rotary controllers, especially in rendering detents and barriers. Combined with compatible and relevant software tools like Immersion ® Studio for Automotive, designers can easily create a wide range of useful, intuitive haptic effects. These tools present an opportunity for haptic research laboratories to quickly acquire the necessary infrastructure critical to performing research studies in haptics, or other Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) tasks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new <b>Haptic</b> Rate-Position <b>controller,</b> which allows manipulating a slave robot {{in a large}} workspace using a small haptic device. This control algorithm is very effective when the master device is {{much smaller than the}} slave device. Haptic information is displayed to the user so as to be informed when a change in the operation mode occurs. This controller allows performing tasks in a large remote workspace by using a haptic device with a reduced workspace such as Phantom. Experimental results have been carried out using a slave robot from Kraft Telerobotics and a commercial haptic interface as a master device. A curvature path following task has been simulated using the proposed controller which was compared with the force-position control algorithm. Results obtained show that higher accuracy is obtained when the proposed method is used, spending a similar amount of time to perform the task...|$|R
