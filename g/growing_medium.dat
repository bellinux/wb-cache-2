40|$|The {{effects of}} inhibitors of {{bacterial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis upon logarithmically growing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. Cell division, ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, and DNA synthesis were measured after addition of nalidixic acid, fluorodeoxyuridine, or phenethyl alcohol to cultures of yeast growing in defined and complex media. Both nalidixic acid and fluorodeoxyuridine had only temporary effects on nucleic acid synthesis in cultures <b>growing</b> in defined <b>medium,</b> and {{little or no}} observable effect on cultures <b>growing</b> in complex <b>medium.</b> Neither compound inhibited colony formation on complex solid medium, although growth was slow on defined solid medium.

25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the apical meristem located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in the <b>growing</b> <b>medium.</b> Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|E
25|$|In {{taking a}} cutting, {{part of a}} growing plant is cut off and placed in a <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> to develop roots.

Unfortunately, thinner and younger {{cuttings}} tend to strike roots more easily than thicker or more mature ones. In bonsai propagation, cuttings usually provide source material to be grown for some time before training.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms out of sync with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> is [...] to provide support and to store water, oxygen and {{dissolved}} minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a <b>growing</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cacti can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings or grafting. Seed sown {{early in}} the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period. Seed is sown in a moist <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> and then kept in a covered environment, until 7–10 days after germination, to avoid drying out. A very wet <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot. A temperature range of [...] is suggested for germination; soil temperatures of around [...] promote the best root growth. Low light levels are sufficient during germination, but afterwards semi-desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth, although acclimatization is needed to conditions in a greenhouse, such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight.|$|E
500|$|Propagation - Both commercially {{and in the}} home, {{propagation}} can {{be achieved}} by using short pieces of stem, one to three segments long, twisted off rather than cut.
