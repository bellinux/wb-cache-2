5000|$|One dated 1811 had the words, [...] "For the {{accommodation}} of the county," [...] in the centre was a pilchard between cakes <b>of</b> copper and <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin.</b> On {{the other side}} were the words Cornish penny, in the centre a view of a mine pumping engine and winding gear.|$|R
5000|$|In 1305 King Edward I {{established}} separate Stannaries for Devon and Cornwall. Water {{was used}} to operate [...] "stamps" [...] to crush the ore, the lighter waste being washed away. The mineral [...] "black tin" [...] was placed in furnaces and layered with peat. The molten metal was poured into granite moulds which produced <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin.</b> These were taken on pack horses to the Stannary towns for assaying. Usable deposits in Devon became worked out and so Cornwall was then the center <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> production. In 1337 Cornish tin production was 650 tons but in 1335 it {{had been reduced to}} 250 tons by the Black Death. In 1400 Cornish production rose to 800 tons. The production in Devon was only 25% of that of Cornwall in 1450-70.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, I. S. Maxwell weighed up the {{competing}} claims of {{no fewer than}} twelve possible sites. In 1983, after excavations, the archaeologist Barry W. Cunliffe proposed the Mount Batten peninsula near Plymouth {{as the site of}} Ictis. Near the mouth of the River Erme, not far away, a shipwreck site has produced <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> ancient <b>tin,</b> which indicates a trade along the coast, although dating the site is difficult and it may not belong to the Bronze Age.|$|R
50|$|Recently Yuval Goren {{proposed}} that the ten tons <b>of</b> copper <b>ingots,</b> one ton <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> <b>ingots,</b> and the resin stored in the Canaanite jars aboard the ship were one complete package. The recipients <b>of</b> the copper, <b>tin,</b> and resin would have used these materials for bronze casting through the lost-wax technique.|$|R
50|$|Initially he was {{involved}} in dairying and timber-getting. He erected the Riverstone Hotel in 1880, which was located on the pack track to Herberton. The Riverstone Hotel was described as:"perhaps the nicest and best loved development in providing for the traveller was WS Alley's Riverstone Hotel the most welcome over night stopping place. Here WS Alley laid out extensive and tasteful tropical gardens and orchards, kept his own dairy and supplied his guests and Cairns with fresh butter. It became the social centre for the district, in demand for farewell gatherings, testimonial dinners and such happy occasions. Here were held dances to the thin sweet strains of the concertina played with the background of the tinkle of bells of packers mules and horses bringing down their <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin.</b> This was built before 1882 and burned down in 1907."WS Alley reportedly erected the first dwelling, constructed the first bridge and road at his own expense, and grubbed (clearing of stumps), cleared and formed a road for about seven miles from Riverstone to Trinity Inlet. He was {{also a member of the}} Cairns Divisional Board and a Justice of the Peace.|$|R
60|$|In {{the very}} {{earliest}} period of our history, before ever the existing names {{had been given}} {{at all to the}} towns or villages--nay, when the towns and villages themselves were not--Ruim was already a noteworthy island. For there is now very little doubt indeed that Thanet is the Ictis or 'Channel Island' to which Cornish tin was conveyed across Britain for shipment to the continent. The great harbour of Britain was then the Wantsum Sea, known afterwards as the Rutupine Port, and later still as Sandwich Haven. To that port came Gaulish and Phoenician vessels, or possibly even at times some belated Phocæan galley from Massilia. But the trade in <b>tin</b> was one <b>of</b> immense antiquity, long antedating these almost modern commercial nations: for tin is a necessary component of bronze, and the bronze age of Europe was entirely dependent for its supply of that all-important metal upon the Cornish mines. From a very early date, therefore, we may be sure that <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> were exported by this route to the continent, and then transported overland by the Rhone valley to the shores of the Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|In his Bibliotheca historica, {{written in}} the 1st century BC, Diodorus Siculus {{described}} ancient tin mining in Britain. [...] "They that inhabit the British promontory of Belerion by reason of their converse with strangers are more civilised and courteous to strangers than the rest are. These {{are the people that}} prepare the tin, which {{with a great deal of}} care and labour, they dig out of the ground, and that being done the metal is mixed with some veins of earth out of which they melt the metal and refine it. Then they cast it into regular blocks and carry it to a certain island near at hand called Ictis for at low tide, all being dry between there and the island, tin in large quantities is brought over in carts." [...] Pliny, whose text has survived in eroded condition, quotes Timaeus of Taormina in referring to [...] "insulam Mictim", [...] "the island of Mictim" [...] sic, where the m of insulam has been repeated. Several locations for [...] "Ictin" [...] or [...] "Ictis", signifying [...] "tin port" [...] have been suggested, including St. Michael's Mount, but, as a result of excavations, Barry Cunliffe has proposed that this was Mount Batten near Plymouth. A shipwreck site with <b>ingots</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was found at the mouth of the River Erme not far away, which may represent trade along this coast during the Bronze Age, although dating the site is very difficult. Strabo reported that British tin was shipped from Marseille.|$|R
50|$|The tin {{resources}} {{are said to}} have been a reason the Romans invaded Britain but they had control of mines in Spain and Brittany in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Later production in Spain was curtailed, probably by raiding. Production in Britain increased in the 3rd century, for use in coinage, and there was extensive use <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in pewter manufacture, at Camerton in Somerset for example. Cornwall and West Devon are areas which are less Romanised than many other parts of Britain and it may be tin mining was in local hands with tin purchase by the imperial authority. A possible official stamp has been identified on the Carnington <b>tin</b> <b>ingot.</b> A number <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> <b>ingots</b> have been found in Roman contexts such as 42 found in a wreck at Bigbury Bay in 1991-92.|$|R
30|$|To better {{understand}} the underlying scientific principles of heat and mass transfer during alloy solidification, a Hele-Shaw-like, quasi-two-dimensional solidification benchmark experiment with well-controlled thermal boundary conditions was proposed [8, 9]. The experiment consisted of solidifying a rectangular <b>ingot</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>tin</b> and binary Sn- 3 wt% Pb alloy using two lateral heat exchangers to extract the heat flux from {{two sides of the}} solidifying sample. The temperature difference between {{the two sides of the}} heat exchangers may vary from 0 to 40  K, and the cooling rate from 0.02 to 0.04  K/s. Segregation formation can be improved within above ranges. An array of fifty thermocouples was sit on the largest area walls to measure the instantaneous temperature distribution, which allowed us to visibly observe temperature field evolution during the whole solidification process, the heat and mass transfer process consequently was achieved, including phase transformations [8]. Meanwhile, a traveling magnetic field was exerted by a linear motor that was placed underneath the rectangular ingot [9]. This traveling magnetic field drives the melt by imposing the volumic and mechanically contactless Lorentz force on it. The role of imposing electromagnetic force and generating forced convection were also investigated in this solidifying benchmark.|$|R

2500|$|The frigate next saw {{action on}} 31 May 1762, when in company with [...] she chased down and {{captured}} the Spanish treasure ship Hermione off Cape St Mary.

50|$|Tampang, <b>tin</b> <b>ingot</b> money <b>of</b> ancient Malaya, survived as {{currency}} in Pahang until 1893. In their original form, tampang were solid slabs <b>of</b> <b>tin,</b> valued at their tin content, and {{were used as}} medium of exchange in Melaka Sultanate. The Portuguese suppressed all Malay currency when they conquered Melaka in 1511, but this form of coinage persisted {{in some of the}} outlying Malay states, particularly Pahang and Selangor. During Tun Ali's reign, the solid tin slabs began to be replaced by hollowed, inscribed pieces, still approximating in appearance to the original tampang, though their intrinsic value bore little relation to their nominal worth. By 1847, <b>tin</b> <b>ingot</b> money <b>of</b> the nominal value of one cent was being produced.

In experimental part, ICP-OES technique was firstly optimized and then 28 different compotes purchased at common stores were analysed. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was determined only in fruit juice due to the easier sample preparation, even though quantity <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the solid part and in the juice can differ. However, the difference is not too big. Measured concentrations <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> were compared with the maximum permissible level <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned food determined by European legislation. None of them exceed the 200 mg/kg level. When processing the results, {{it was found that}} the coating of the can has a significant influence on the content <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned fruits.
