This {{study investigated}} the sources of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety {{and the relationship between}} proficiency levels and degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety. The study was conducted at Hacettepe University, with the participation of 234 students from the departments of Basic English, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, International Relations and English Linguistics. Data were collected through a proficiency exam, a questionnaire and interviews. The proficiency exam is an adapted version of the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency. The questionnaire had two parts. In the second part, the participants were given an adapted version of the <b>Foreign</b> <b>Language</b> Speaking Anxiety Scale (FLSAS), which was developed by Huang (2004). Afterwards, nine students were selected for participation in the interviews to get a more detailed analysis of the sources of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety. The analysis of the quantitative data revealed that the participants had a moderate level of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety, and that the level of learners‟ language proficiency did not {{play an important role in}} their degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the 1960 ’s {{the need}} {{to put in place}} a {{language}} of instruction policy that favours the use of national language (Kiswahili) as a medium of instruction throughout education system in Tanzania has been considered significant. Several government guidelines, circulars and policy statements have been repeatedly produced in this regard, but with little hope! This study presents views and opinions from educational stakeholders in Tanzania as to why there has been such ambivalence in the language of instruction policy, especially at post-primary levels of education. Different views and opinions were elicited from twenty research participants, who were in four major categories: government policy-makers (GPM), university academics and researchers (UAR), international donors to Tanzania (IDT) and the general public (GP). Females and males, one each made 50 % of all research participants. Face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, documentation analysis and library survey were the main methods used in data collection. Phenomenological strategy within the qualitative approach was employed to guide the process of data analysis and interpretation on the one hand, and argumentation and discussion of research findings on the other. The study also used Qualification Analysis (QA), Linguistic Human Rights (LHRs) and Education for Self-Reliance (ESR) as the major theories which basically served as a guide. To achieve the major purpose of the study, the following main research question was used: ‘Why has Tanzanian government been so ambivalent to the use of Kiswahili as the language of instruction in post-primary education despite the fact that Kiswahili is spoken by almost 99 % of Tanzanians compared with English, which is a <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>spoken</b> by hardly 5 % of the population?’ According to the data analysis and interpretation (section 5. 3) and the whole corpus of discussion of major themes and research findings (section 5. 4), the study shows {{that there are a number}} of reasons and facts which, over the last forty years, have attributed to the ambivalence of the language-in-education policy in Tanzania, particularly in secondary schools and higher learning institutions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} spoken L 3 German of Swedish CLIL {{learners}} in {{lower secondary school}} (grades 8 - 9) in comparison to Swedish non-CLIL controls and German native speakers; its main objective is to investigate whether the CLIL approach has {{a positive impact on}} L 3 production. The study deals with vocabulary size and frequency in the spoken lexicon as well as communicative strategies and is based on data consisting of narratives elicited through the retelling of Mayer’s well-known picture story Frog, where are you? Material was also elicited in the learners’ L 1 Swedish and in their L 2 English. In addition to being contrastive, the study is also longitudinal, in the sense that recordings of the learners’ <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> <b>spoken</b> productions were made twice, as opposed to those of their L 1 Swedish or the L 1 German of the native speaker control group. Albeit both learner groups dispose of a rather limited lexical production compared with the German native speakers, the analysis of vocabulary size shows that the L 3 narratives of the CLIL learners are not only longer, but also more varied and thus have a greater lexical richness than those of the non-CLIL controls. There seems to be no clear correlation between the L 1 and the L 3 productions, neither for the CLIL group nor for the non-CLIL group, {{which is to say that}} the progress in the L 3 cannot be directly linked to L 1 proficiency. Similar positive results for the CLIL group were observed in the L 2 English narratives, which may indicate an impact of CLIL on enhanced skills in other foreign languages. In the investigation vocabulary frequency, the analysis points to a higher level of L 3 German proficiency for the CLIL group, in that they show a higher number of synsemantic words (such as e. g. pronouns and cohesive ties) and a lower number of basic, so-called nuclear verbs and adjectives. Again, the same positive tendencies could be seen in their L 2 English. The analysis of the employment of communication strategies (CS) among the Swedish learners indicates that both learner groups experience communication problems in their L 3 German and thus resort to CS. However, the use of L 3 -based, so-called positive CS is much more frequent among the CLIL learners, whereas their non-CLIL peers display a clearly predominant use of L 1 -based, so-called negative CS. In contrast to earlier Swedish CLIL evaluations of L 2 English, this study points to a positive influence of CLIL on spoken L 3 German. Even though no statistically significant results could be obtained due to the fairly small size of the test groups, clear gains are visible in all aspects examined, i. e. vocabulary size, vocabulary frequency and communication strategies. There are several pedagogical implications of this study concerning successful classroom L 3 learning. Most importantly, the number of L 3 CLIL projects should be enhanced in order to boost progress in L 3 skills. Thus, a CLIL module (encompassing e. g. connection between input/output, lexical acquisition and communication strategy use) should be introduced in the teacher education programme for traditional FL education to benefit from. Furthermore, there were no drop-outs during the period of investigation in comparison to a drop-out rate of approx. 35 per cent among the controls, which may suggest that CLIL also fosters motivation for FL learning...|$|E
