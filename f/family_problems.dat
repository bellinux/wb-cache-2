5|$|Neighbours storylines {{frequently}} {{focus on}} <b>family</b> <b>problems,</b> intergenerational clashes, school problems, romances and domestic issues. Despite the restrictive 6:30pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious {{problems such as}} teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, eating disorders, alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs, murder, shootings, stabbings, and incest. In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and alzheimer's disease. In September 2014, the show featured a natural disaster storyline, in which a tornado descended on Erinsborough and Ramsay Street.|$|E

This model can pull a variety of information and perspectives together, organize them into a 2 ̆ 2 map 2 ̆ 2 of family interaction, and give a much needed, fuller picture of family behavior. The model description also contains {{a review of the literature}} that proved instrumental in determining the model 2 ̆ 7 s factors and linkages;The testing of this model commenced in a study considering the interrelationships between several of the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> solving interaction variables as they influence <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> solving effectiveness. Theoretical predictions for each variable 2 ̆ 7 s influence on the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> solving process were developed. The results indicate each variable plays some role in determining <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> solving effectiveness, although not necessarily the theoretically predicted role. The findings also attest to the intricacies of family interaction and underscore the importance of considering several variables simultaneously when analyzing <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> solving behavior...|$|R

A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with <b>family</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the mailroom at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses to raise it with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull Goldin) and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other <b>family</b> <b>problems</b> overwhelm her.

40|$|The theorized {{influence}} of Milan systemic family therapy on family constructions {{of responsibility and}} blame was examined. It was predicted that family members would accept more responsibility and engage in less blaming behavior of one another as family therapy progressed for four sessions. Feminists have criticized Milan systemic family therapy since it failed to consider gender issues in the family 2 ̆ 7 s constructions of problems. The differences between men 2 ̆ 7 s status and women 2 ̆ 7 s status within the family was not considered by the Milan theorists to be important. This {{has led to the}} concern that women may be viewed as more responsible for the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> by therapists using the Milan model (Luepnitz, 1988). The issue of equitability as to which parent was blamed or perceived as responsible for the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> was also examined. The participants of the study were members of three families participating in Milan systemic family therapy offered at a local university training clinic. Sessions were videotaped and then coded using the Cognitive Constructions Coding System (Friedlander, 1991). Results partially supported the predictions that families would increase the number of responsible statements and decrease the number of blaming statements made over the course of four sessions. Partial support was also found for the predictions that parents attributing responsibility to themselves for the <b>family</b> <b>problem,</b> or denying responsibility for the <b>family</b> <b>problem,</b> would decrease these statements by the fourth session. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{described}} three previously undetected effects, due to {{biases and}} non-independence, that can arise in statistical tests for associations between character states in cross-species data. One kind, {{which we call}} the <b>family</b> <b>problem,</b> is general to all known methods. In phytogenetic data, the ancestral character state from which changes occur, or below which variation is found, {{is likely to be}} the same for many regions of the tree. The <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> interacts with two kinds of non-independence that arise because of the methods of reconstruction of character states that existing tests use. Different kinds of non-independence arise in methods that reconstruct joint, or single, character states, respectively. Methods, like Ridley's (1983), that work with joint character states suffer from the problem that a character state cannot change to itself with parsimony. Other methods that work with single character states suffer from the problem that within a locally variable region of the tree it is more likely with null data that there will be two single changes in the two characters in separate branches than one double change in both; associations opposite to the locally ancestral state are therefore likely to be found in more than 50 % of the variable regions. In real data sets, the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> acts to spotlight the other kinds of bias: if the <b>family</b> <b>problem</b> is large the bias in tests due to the way they reconstruct characters will be large, whereas if it is small, the local biases tend to cancel and disappear in the aggregate...|$|R

Suicidal ideation is as culturally accepted in south India as in some high-income countries.

Suicide ideation among surviving family members of farmers' suicide victims is another worry.
