5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E

5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian {{in order to test}} the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, {{a series}} of <b>drop</b> <b>tests</b> of the Space Shuttle Enterprise were {{conducted}} to test the Space Shuttle's flight characteristics. [...] Because the Space Shuttle is designed to glide unpowered during its descent and landing, {{a series of}} <b>drop</b> <b>tests</b> using a test orbiter were used {{to demonstrate that the}} orbiter could be successfully controlled in unpowered flight. [...] These <b>drop</b> <b>tests,</b> known as the Approach and Landing Test program, used a modified Boeing 747, known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft or SCA, to carry Enterprise to an altitude of 15,000 to 30,000 feet. [...] After a series of captive-flight tests in which the orbiter was not released, five free-flight tests were performed in August through October 1977.|$|R

2500|$|The {{landing gear}} on {{aircraft}} used on aircraft carriers must be stronger {{than those on}} land-based aircraft, due to higher approach speeds and sink rates during carrier landings. [...] As early as the 1940s, <b>drop</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted by lifting a carrier-based plane such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat to a height of ten feet and then dropped, simulating {{the impact of a}} landing at nineteen feet per second. [...] The F6F was ultimately dropped from a height of twenty feet, demonstrating it could absorb twice the force of a carrier landing. <b>Drop</b> <b>tests</b> are still used in the development and testing of carrier-based aircraft; in 2010, the Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II underwent <b>drop</b> <b>tests</b> to simulate its maximum descent rate of 26.4 feet per second during carrier landings.|$|R

2500|$|In April 2012, Boeing {{conducted}} another <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> of its CST-100 prototype space capsule {{in order}} to test the capsule's landing systems. [...] The test vehicle was raised by helicopter to an altitude of 11,000 feet and then released; the capsule's three main parachutes then deployed successfully and slowed the capsule's descent. [...] Immediately prior to landing, the capsule's six airbags inflated underneath the capsule {{in order to}} absorb some of the impact energy from landing. [...] Similar drop tests are planned in order to conduct additional airbag testing, as well as drogue chute and heat shield jettison tests.|$|E
