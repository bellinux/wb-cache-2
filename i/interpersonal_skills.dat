5|$|He {{moved on}} to Ipswich Town in 1969 {{and it was there}} that he {{established}} his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977–78 season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal] in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5–4 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold Mühren. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, with his good <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skills,</b> caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skills.</b> Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E

40|$|New {{and better}} {{predictors}} of college {{academic achievement and}} attitude can be of value initially for student selection and subsequently for individualization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationships of cognitive style and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> to achievement and attitude in two dental hygiene program components, science lecture courses and clinical courses. Participants were 167 students of Marquette University School of Dental Hygiene. Each completed a cognitive style scale and a program attitude scale. Instructors completed interpersonal rating scales. Grades and traditional predictor data were obtained from student records. Data were conceptualized within a regression equation approach for student selection, and a directional hypothesis approach for individualization. The directional hypothesis analysis employed MANOVAs, and a t test. The. 05 significance level was applied for all statistical tests except the t test where the. 025 level was used. The regression equation approach, including traditional predictors, resulted in cognitive style and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill,</b> contributing jointly as significant predictors of achievement in science lecture and clinical courses. Considered separately with traditional predictors, <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> significantly contributed to achievement prediction in both program components; cognitive style significantly contributed to achievement prediction in clinical courses only. Directional hypothesis results showed that: students with high <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> had significantly higher GPAs in and attitudes toward clinical courses than students with low skill (p 3 ̆c. 001,. 005, respectively); field-independent students with high <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> had significantly higher grades in science lecture and clinical courses than field-dependent students with low <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> (p 3 ̆c. 001); field-independent students with high <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skill</b> had commensurate achievement in both program components. Descriptive statistics showed that participants were relatively field independent and had a preference and higher achievement for clinical courses compared to science lecture courses. Results were discussed; implications for student selection and individualization were examined. Recommendations for future research were presented...|$|R

Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work. While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective <b>interpersonal</b> <b>skills</b> to gain citizen trust and compliance.
