5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} {{mechanical}} <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> were installed. The majority {{were similar to}} the LNER standard type but others of a Westinghouse type were to be found at Larne Harbour {{and a few other}} locations.|$|E
500|$|In May 1921, it was {{reported}} that a waiting room for the use of passengers at Lympne was being planned. In June a Notice to Airmen was released saying that, for cost reasons, lights would no longer be exhibited after sunset without prior arrangement. The system of <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> was amended with effect from 14 July, and in September an [...] "aerial lighthouse" [...] {{was reported}} to be under construction. The system of aerial lighthouses on the [...] "London – Paris Airway" [...] was completed in December 1921.|$|E

500|$|In January 1922, a [...] high mast for an {{anemometer}} {{was being}} erected {{at the south}} west corner of Lympne Aerodrome. On 13 February, the system of <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> at Lympne was further extended to include information about the Saint-Inglevert Airfield, just across the English Channel in France. In July, a Notice to Airmen said that all aircraft were to make at least one left-hand circuit before landing at Lympne. By November, the Instone Air Line were operating a service from Croydon to Cologne using de Havilland DH.18 aircraft, stopping at Lympne to refuel to full capacity. These aircraft then had the necessary range to fly direct from Lympne to Cologne. This arrangement did not last long, with the refuelling stop moved to Tirlemont, Belgium, {{by the end of}} the month. On 30 December a Dornier aircraft landed at Lympne. It was the first German aircraft to land on British soil since the end of the First World War. A German airline, Aero-Lloyd was in negotiation with Daimler Airway to start a service between London and Berlin.|$|E
500|$|The North Sea Aerial and General Transport Co. used a Blackburn Kangaroo on its {{short-lived}} Leeds-Lympne-Amsterdam {{service from}} 6 March 1920. The customs facilities at New Holland had been withdrawn on 28 January, necessitating the roundabout route. It was {{estimated that the}} extra costs involved in taking this route amounted to one-third of the total costs. Flight called for customs facilities to be established to enable direct flights to be made from the north of England to the continent. Starting from 2 August, hourly weather forecasts were broadcast from Lympne and other airfields. A system of <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> advising pilots of the weather conditions at Biggin Hill and Croydon was also introduced about this time. During August, Aircraft Transport and Travel took over air mail flights, using DH.9A aircraft. In November a Notice to Airmen was released announcing that searchlights would be in use at Lympne for two hours after sunset to assist pilots in landing their aircraft. Arrangements could be made in advance for this facility to be made available after the notified hours. In December, {{it was announced that}} an [...] "aerial lighthouse" [...] was to be installed at Lympne as the one installed at Croydon had proved to be of benefit to pilots arriving after dark.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, an {{airfield}} {{was established}} at Saint-Inglevert {{on a different}} site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed {{over the years to}} include two hangars, customs facilities and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A [...] arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a windsock and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920.|$|E
50|$|The {{signals are}} {{standard}} BR ones using a former LMS design but {{the signal to}} the carriage sidings is unusual. It is a semaphore <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> mounted onto a conventional signal post.|$|R
50|$|The red {{aspect is}} usually {{positioned}} {{at the bottom}} of pole and gantry mounted signals is so that snow does not build up on the lens hood of an aspect placed below the red aspect, resulting in the aspect becoming obscured. Similarly it is placed {{at the top of a}} <b>ground</b> mounted <b>signal</b> to minimize the risk of the red aspect becoming obscured by snow build up on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Signal</b> alignment is generally aimed towards a distance 200 metres in rear of the signal and at a height of 2.5 to 3 m from the left hand rail. <b>Ground</b> mounted <b>signals</b> are rarely so critical for alignment (hence ground mounting) and are often used in tunnels where the relative luminosity of the aspects are much higher.|$|R
50|$|Ae 6/6 11437 «Stadt Basel» {{caused a}} stir when it derailed after passed a <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> ("Zwergsignal") at red on a {{shunting}} track and derailed on a catch point. The engine {{ended up in a}} tilted position in the ballast beside the main track. However, it wasn't damaged heavily and returned to service soon after the incident.|$|R
2500|$|The {{experience}} of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1916, showed that single-engine fighters with superior performance could operate in pairs but where the aircraft were of inferior performance, formation flying was essential, even though fighting in the air split formations. By flying in formations made up of permanent sub-units of from [...] British squadrons gained the benefit of concentration and a measure of flexibility, the formations being made up of three units; extra formations could be added to be mutually supporting. Tactics were left to individual discretion but freelancing became less common. By {{the end of the}} Somme battle, it had become common for reconnaissance aircraft to operate in formation with escorts and for bomber formations to have a close escort of six F.E.2bs and a distant escort of six single-seat fighters. The revival of the German Air Service and formation of the Luftstreitkräfte in October 1916, led in October to the British using wireless interception stations (Compass Stations) quickly to locate aircraft operating over the British front, as part of an integrated system. Trained observers gleaned information on German aircraft movements from wireless signals or ground observation and communicated the bearing from interception stations by wireless to wing headquarters or telephoned squadrons direct. Aircraft on patrol were directed to busy areas of the front by <b>ground</b> <b>signals,</b> although no attempt was made to control the interception of individual aircraft from the ground.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} {{mechanical}} <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> were installed. The majority {{were similar to}} the LNER standard type but others of a Westinghouse type were to be found at Larne Harbour {{and a few other}} locations.|$|E
5000|$|This {{information}} is verified on arrival by overflying the airfield {{and looking out}} for the wind direction indications from a wind sock, smoke from fires, etc., or any <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> in the signals square (if present). This involves positioning the aircraft {{so that it is}} flying across the direction of the runway and typically at 1000 feet above the circuit pattern for the airfield.|$|E
50|$|Some probes {{contain a}} push button. Pressing the button will either {{disconnect}} the signal (and send a <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> to the 'scope) or cause the 'scope {{to identify the}} trace in some other way. This feature is very useful when simultaneously using more than one probe as it lets the user correlate probes and traces on the 'scope screen.|$|R
5000|$|Type I is {{the most}} common {{standard}} in North America and Japan, and signals an outgoing call to the signaling unit with Battery on the M ("Mouth") lead. Incoming calls are signaled by an Earth (<b>ground)</b> <b>signal</b> on the E ("Ear") lead. The interface is vulnerable to poor earthing at either end, and interference from external electrical noise ...|$|R
5000|$|Distributed or modular BMSs {{must use}} some low level {{internal}} cell-controller (Modular architecture) or controller-controller (Distributed architecture) communication. These types of communications are difficult, especially for high voltage systems. The problem is voltage shift between cells. The first cell <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> may {{be hundreds of}} volts higher than the other cell <b>ground</b> <b>signal.</b> Apart from software protocols, there are two known ways of hardware communication for voltage shifting systems, Optical-isolator and wireless communication. Another restriction for internal communications is {{the maximum number of}} cells. For modular architecture most hardware is limited to maximum 255 nodes. For high voltage systems the seeking time of all cells is another restriction, limiting minimum bus speeds and losing some hardware options. Cost of modular systems is important, because it may be comparable to the cell price. Combination of hardware and software restrictions results to be a few options for internal communication: ...|$|R
50|$|The group {{replaced}} its Matadors with TM-76 Mace (later MGM-13) missiles. These missiles did {{not rely}} on <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> for guidance, but used an onboard radar to match the terrain with a map stored on board the missile. In 1962 the 585th and its companion groups in Germany were inactivated and the missile squadrons assigned directly to the 38th Wing. On the same day, the last Matador at Bitburg was decommissioned.|$|E
50|$|Another {{system which}} {{is vital to}} a {{spacecraft}} is the command and telemetry system, so much in fact, {{that it is the}} first system to be redundant. The communication from the ground to the spacecraft {{is the responsibility of the}} command system. The telemetry system handles communications from the spacecraft to the <b>ground.</b> <b>Signals</b> from ground stations are sent to command the spacecraft what to do, while telemetry reports back on the status of those commands including spacecraft vitals and mission specific data.|$|E
50|$|Aerodrome traffic zones (ATZ) are {{circular}} zones {{around an}} airport with a radius of 2 nmi or 2.5 nmi depending on runway length, {{extending from the}} surface to 2000 ft AAL (above aerodrome level). Aircraft within an ATZ must obey the instructions of the tower controller (if present), or must make radio contact with the Aerodrome Flight Information Service unit or Air/Ground Communication Service unit for the aerodrome before entering the zone (in {{the case of an}} uncontrolled airfield), or must obey <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> if non-radio.|$|E

The city's law department represents the city on all legal issues, serving as counsel to all municipal departments.|$|R
50|$|Econet is a five-wire bus network. One pair {{of wires}} {{is used for}} the clock, one pair for data, and one wire as a common <b>ground.</b> <b>Signalling</b> used the RS-422 5-volt {{differential}} standard, with one bit transferred per clock cycle. Unshielded cable was used for short lengths, and shielded cable for longer networks. The cable was terminated at each end to prevent reflections and to guarantee high logic levels when the bus was undriven.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the west}} side of the rail via tunnel, four tracks converged into three, and then into two tracks to pass over the Hackensack Drawbridge. By 1913 the rail line, {{including}} the bridges across the rivers, was raised about 30 ft to avoid conflicts with maritime traffic in the newly developing port [...] The draw span of the PD Draw over the Passaic had been relocated 185 ft upstream to create another bridge on a new alignment in 1912.By 1922, plans were made to improve the drawbridge's railway signal layout, increasing the number of interlocking levers, <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> and bridge signals. The drawbridge tower employed three levermen.|$|E
5000|$|The 24 I/O lines {{available}} on the DCEbus (from an Intel 8255 of the controlling computer) could be used directly, or could use the [...] "DCE bus mode", in which the 24 I/O lines were grouped in three groups of eight I/O lines, of which the first group was used for data, and of the second group two were used for read and write strobes, and one for [...] "bus expansion", the third group was used for eight [...] "card address lines". Most often these setup was used to control another Intel 58255 on the actual interface card. The remaining seven pins of the 31-pin DIN connector were used for power and <b>ground</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables were designed for, though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} <b>ground</b> <b>signal,</b> significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High Speed signaling.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} an appropriate attitude of three-axis stabilized communication satellites, this paper describes a novel attitude determination method using direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of a <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> source. It differs from optical measurement, magnetic field measurement, inertial measurement, and global positioning system (GPS) attitude determination. The proposed method is characterized by taking the <b>ground</b> <b>signal</b> source as the attitude reference and acquiring attitude information from DOA estimation. Firstly, an attitude measurement equation with DOA estimation is derived in detail. Then, the error of the measurement equation is analyzed. Finally, an attitude determination algorithm is presented using a dynamic model, the attitude measurement equation, and measurement errors. A developing low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite which tests mobile communication technology with smart antennas can be stabilized in three axes by corporately using a magnetometer, reaction wheels, and three-axis magnetorquer rods. Based on the communication satellite, simulation results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method. The method could be a backup of attitude determination to prevent a system failure on the satellite. Its precision depends on the number of snapshots and the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with DOA estimation...|$|R
60|$|On Sunday, the 1st of June, General Wood {{with a small}} escort was out reconnoitring {{in advance}} of his column, which was about five miles {{in front of the}} force of General Newdigate.

50|$|In {{the last}} days of the Soviet Union there was a {{considerable}} Soviet Air Defence Forces presence, and a smaller Air Forces presence, in the Moscow Military District. The Air Forces of the Moscow Military District consisted of a reconnaissance regiment, the 47th Guards Separate Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment at Shatalovo flying Su-24MPs, and the 9th Fighter Aviation Division (9 iad), at Kubinka, with three regiments. The division incorporated the 32nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, also at Shatalovo, with MiG-23MLDs, the 234th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment at Kubinka with MiG-29s, and the 274th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment at Migalovo (274 apib) with Su-17s. Also part of the force was a <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> regiment, the 131st.There was also a transport squadron, an independent helicopter regiment, and an independent helicopter squadron for electronic warfare.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} connection is realized as a serial bus with a fixed data rate of 9600 baud. There are just 2 communications signals plus the essential common-ground reference signal. The TX signal goes from the MASTER to every SLAVE device. The RX signal goes from every SLAVE device to the MASTER device. Both signals have pull-ups. The bus is driven at every transmitter by an open collector transistor driver, and isolated at each receiver with an opto-isolator - though cable harnesses carrying the communication signals may also carry 24-volt power and <b>ground</b> <b>signals</b> to devices, meaning the devices {{may not be}} isolated from {{each other as they}} share the same power bus. Some devices, however, may have alternate power supplies, especially devices with motors and high current needs such as vintage bill acceptors or currency detector devices.|$|E
5000|$|After WW2 {{it became}} a trade {{training}} camp for certain <b>ground</b> <b>Signals</b> trades. Many thousands of newly recruited RAF personnel, most having just completed their 8 weeks basic training, were taught their RAF trade skills at RAF Compton Bassett, so as to become competent Wireless Operators, Teleprinter Operators, Telegraphists or Telephonists before being posted to work at RAF operational stations and airfields elsewhere in the United Kingdom or abroad. As well as their trade training, personnel experienced tougher service discipline at Compton Bassett than on operational stations. There were frequent parades involving military drill, regular [...] "stand by your beds" [...] inspections of personal appearance, kit inspections and inspections of barrack hut accommodation. Being put on a charge for not being up to required standard, resulting in Jankers, was very commonly experienced by personnel while being trade trained there.|$|E
