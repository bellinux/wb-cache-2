In the case of the thermoelectric module that was not subjected to <b>electroless</b> Ni–P <b>plating,</b> Sn and Te were interdiffused and formed a brittle Sn–Te-based metallic compound.

Results indicate higher conductivity and lower durability for Cu–Ni–P-coated samples compared to its counterpart with same sub-layer included with nickel on top layer. The SEM image of Cu–Ni–P particle on PET fabric shows a hexagonal non-homogenous morphology with nanoscale crack on its surface. However, the micrograph of the Cu–Ni–P–Ni <b>electroless</b> <b>plated</b> fabric shows an extremely compact and continuous phase with clear boundaries containing semispherical particles. The thermopile radiated sensing system was used as a sophisticated device to show the thermal energy absorption level. The acquired data indicate a 2.3 and 2.7  unit reduction in transmitted radiated power, respectively, for Cu–Ni–P and Cu–Ni–P–Ni conducting fabric. The captured thermal camera images of human body while keeping in front of a Cu–Ni–P conducting fabric revealed a nearly black and blue feature which proves the significant decrease in body radiated thermal energy. However, the thermal image of Cu–Ni–P–Ni conductive fabric shows almost black appearance in all areas. It can be presumably due to improving of the IR rejection performance and also formation of a massive barrier against body thermal radiation for promising camouflage applications.|$|R

50|$|The process usually {{involves}} a dynamically reconfigurable digital photomask. A 3-D model is decomposed {{into a series}} of 2-D planes, the pattern of which is transmitted to the photomask.

These process is repeated for each layer and assembled together to form a 3-D system. Non-polymer lattices can also be created from this process by additional processing. For instance, metallic structures can be created by <b>electroless</b> <b>plating</b> onto the base structure followed by removal of the polymer through thermal heating.

5000|$|Wet gilding is {{effected}} {{by means of}} a dilute solution of gold(III) chloride with twice its quantity of ether. The liquids are agitated and allowed to rest, to allow the ether to separate and float {{on the surface of the}} acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off and the ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with fine emery and spirits of wine. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished. For small delicate figures, a pen or a fine brush may be used for laying on the ether solution. The gold(III) chloride can also be dissolved in water in <b>electroless</b> <b>plating</b> wherein the gold is slowly reduced out of solution onto the surface to be gilded.

50|$|The EN plating of {{metallic}} nickel from {{aqueous solution}} {{in the presence}} of hypophosphite was first noted as a chemical accident by Wurtz in 1844. In 1911, Roux reported that metal was inevitably precipitated in the powder form; however these works were not in practical applications. In its early stage, progress in the field remained slow until World War II. In 1946, Brenner and Riddell developed a process for plating the inner walls of tubes with nickel-tungsten alloy, derived from the citrate based bath using an insoluble anode, which brought out the unusual reducing properties of hypophosphite. The U.S. Patent Office says that the patent it issued in 1950 differed from the earlier patent in that Roux reaction was spontaneous and complete, while the Brenner and Riddell process was a controlled catalytic process so that deposition occurred only on catalytic surfaces immersed in the bath. Brenner later wrote that his patent was an accidental discovery similar to the work of Wurtz and Roux, but said that he took out a patent to protect U.S. government rights. In fact, a declassified U.S. Army technical report written in 1963 goes on extensively about Wurtz and Roux work, and gives more of the discovery credit to them than to Brenner. This plating process was attributed to the action of chemical reduction of Ni ions. During the 1954-59 period, Gutzeit at GATC (General American Transportation Corporation) worked on full scale development of <b>electroless</b> <b>plating</b> by chemical reduction alone, as an alternate process to conventional electroplating. Initially, the co-deposition of particles was carried out for electrodepositing Ni-Cr by Odekerken, during the year of 1966. In that study, in an intermediate layer, finely powdered particles like aluminum oxide, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin were distributed within a metallic matrix. A layer in the coating is composite but other parts of the coating are not. The first commercial application of their work used the electroless Ni-SiC coatings on the wankel internal combustion engine and another commercial composite incorporating polytetrafluoroethylene (Ni-P-PTFE) was co-deposited, during the year of 1981. However, the co-deposition of diamond and PTFE particles was more difficult than that of composites incorporating Al2O3 or SiC. The feasibility to incorporate the fine second phase particles, in submicron to nano size, within a metal/alloy matrix has initiated a new generation of composite coatings.|$|E

The copper layer experiences mechanical stressing through the temperature excursion, thus raising reliability concern of the component. Such reliability assessment calls for the determination of the mechanical properties of the thin layer.

A series of nanoindentation tests are performed on sputtered and <b>electroless</b> <b>plated</b> copper layer. The tests cover a range of probe displacement rates from 80 - 400 nm/s and indentation depths up to 400 nm. Load-displacement (depth) data pairs are recorded for each test.
