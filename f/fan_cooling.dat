25|$|Two double-carriage {{units were}} {{destroyed}} on 5 September 1983, when a <b>fan</b> <b>cooling</b> the brake system was damaged. The train {{was taken out}} of service at Hauptbahnhof and parked on an underground siding track between there and Königsplatz, where it caught fire.

25|$|The XP-47J {{began as}} a November 1942 request to Republic for a {{high-performance}} version of the Thunderbolt using a lighter airframe and an uprated engine with water injection and <b>fan</b> <b>cooling.</b> Kartveli designed a completely new aircraft fitted with a tight-cowled Pratt & Whitney R-2800-57 with a war emergency rating of 2,800hp (2,090kW), reduced armament of six 0.50in (12.7mm) machine guns, a new and lighter wing, and many other changes. The only XP-47J was first flown in late November 1943 by Republic test pilot Mike Ritchie. Less {{than a year later}} it flew into the aviation history books marking a new milestone for speed.|$|E
2500|$|The MP6 {{prototype}} {{had large}} grilles {{on the front}} and rear of the rear fender covering the engine. This was done to allow air in to cool the engine, as the prototype did not have <b>fan</b> <b>cooling.</b> [...] A cooling fan similar to that used on the MP5 [...] "Paperino" [...] prototype was included {{in the design of the}} production Vespa, and the grilles were removed from the fender.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{choice of}} the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling [...] "system" [...] which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the <b>fan,</b> <b>cooling</b> was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|E

50|$|Attaching an {{internal}} fan to a motor {{is a fairly}} simple way to cool it. Since a fan cooled motor always provides airflow over itself {{regardless of whether it}} is stationary or partially enclosed, it is more effective than using a heat sink in applications with poor airflow because heat sinks usually require air to be flowing over them for maximum effectiveness. Internal <b>fan</b> <b>cooling</b> also takes up far less space than external <b>fan</b> <b>cooling</b> or water cooling.|$|E

40|$|Article history: Because {{of their}} longer {{operating}} times and larger size relative to conventional <b>fans,</b> the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted in buses consume larger amounts of energy. Most of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted {{in a bus}} {{are connected to the}} engine by a viscous clutch. A viscous cooling fan’s speed is determined by its fluid temperature, which is affected by the air flow through the radiator. The fan does not react immediately to the coolant temperature and in doing so causes unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, the fuel economy of buses using viscous fans can be improved by changing to an electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> design, which can be actively controlled. In addition, electric power consumption is increased by using electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> Thus, when electric fans are applied in conjunction with the alternator management system (AMS), the fuel economy is further enhanced. In this study, simulations were performed to predict coolant temperature and <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> speeds. Simulations were performed for both viscous and electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> and power consumption was calculated. Additionally, fuel economy was calculated applying both the alternator management system and the electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R
