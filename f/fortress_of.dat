Al-Rahba was the easternmost <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Shirkuh II's Homs-based emirate, {{and was one}} of the four principal centers of the emirate, the other three being Homs itself, Salamiyah and Palmyra. He personally oversaw the demolition of al-Rahba's ruins and the construction of the new fortress. Al-Rahba remained in the hands of Shirkuh's descendants until a few years after the annexation of Ayyubid Syria by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1260.|$|E

5|$|The Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–48 was waged between Venetian and Ottoman forces {{against the}} Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. The war {{was the result}} of a dispute between the Republic and the Dukagjini family over the {{possession}} of the Dagnum fortress. Skanderbeg, then ally of the Dukagjini family, moved against several Venetian held towns along the Albanian coastline, in order to pressure the Venetians into restoring Dagnum. In response, the Republic sent a local force to relieve the besieged <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Dagnum, and urged the Ottoman Empire to send an expeditionary force into Albania. At that time the Ottomans were already besieging the <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Svetigrad, stretching Skanderbeg's efforts thin.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Svetigrad {{began on}} May 14, 1448 when an Ottoman army, led by Sultan Murad II, besieged the <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Svetigrad (now Kodžadžik). After the many failed Ottoman expeditions into Albania against the League of Lezhë, a {{confederation}} of Albanian Principalities created in 1444 and headed by Skanderbeg, Murad II decided to march an army into Skanderbeg's dominions {{in order to}} capture the key Albanian <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Svetigrad. The fortress lay on an important route between Macedonia and Albania, and thus its occupation would give the Ottomans easy access into Albania. The force prepared by Murad was the largest force with which the Ottomans had ever attacked Skanderbeg. Murad planned to take the fortress, march into the Albanian interior, and capture the main citadel of Krujë, thus crushing the Albanian League.|$|E

5|$|By 1799, the <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Mantua on {{the river}} Mincio in {{northern}} Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that the fortress would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{crossed the}} Dutch {{frontier}} on 16 February 1793. The <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Breda fell {{after a quick}} siege from 21 to 24 February 1793. The 3,000 Dutch defenders, which included 2,500 infantry and a dragoon regiment, surrendered the city with its 250 cannon and were allowed to go free. Also on the 21st, Maastricht was invested by 10,000 troops of Miranda's army. There were 8,000 Austrian and Dutch defenders under Prince Karl Wilhelm Georg of Hesse-Darmstadt, an Austrian General-major. The siege work at Maastricht in winter weather {{was too much for}} the French volunteers and many deserted their units and went home. The <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Geertruidenberg with 150 guns capitulated after a siege from 1 to 4 March. The Dutch garrison of two battalions and two squadrons were allowed to go free. Both Breda and Geertruidenberg had been bluffed into giving up by the military engineer Jean Claude le Michaud d'Arcon, who had designed the floating batteries at the Great Siege of Gibraltar. A small fort at Klundert was captured on 4 March by 4,000 men under Berneron. The tiny garrison put up a stiff fight and lost 60 killed before the 73 survivors gave up.|$|E

5|$|During the winter, they {{fortified}} their defenses {{around the}} southern peninsula of Hakodate, {{with the new}} <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Goryōkaku at the center. The troops were organized under a Franco-Japanese command, the commander-in-chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet, and divided between four brigades. Each of these was commanded by a French non-commissioned officer (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve, Bouffier), and were themselves divided into eight half-brigades, each under Japanese command.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though they}} lifted {{the siege of}} Barletta upon seeing Skanderbeg's {{approaching}} men the week before, Angevin forces remained active. Once Skanderbeg arrived, Ferdinand put him {{in command of the}} <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Barletta whereas the King himself went to Ariano Irpino. Once left in command of the fortress, Skanderbeg moved against Ferdinand's rivals. Among them were Giovanni Orsini, Jean d'Anjou (the Duke of Calabria), Piccinino, and Francesco del Balzo. They had stationed themselves in Andria, where the Albanian assaults continued. The Albanian cavalry's light armament, swift horses and loose ranks allowed them to quickly overcome the more heavily armed Italian cavalry, which fought in tight formations. In one of their operations, an Albanian warrior captured Alois Minutulo, the lord of the Castle of Monte Sant'Angelo who was imprisoned in the <b>Fortress</b> <b>of</b> Barletta. Three years later, Ferdinand would present Skanderbeg with the castle as a token of his gratitude.|$|E

5|$|In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Modica also fell, {{while the}} Byzantines, now {{at peace with}} the Abbasid Caliphate, {{received}} reinforcements from the eastern theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and the <b>fortress</b> <b>of</b> Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender it to the Muslims, who razed it to the ground. At {{about the same time}} (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm.|$|E
