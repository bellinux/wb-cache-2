40|$|The {{leaves of}} Syngonium {{podophyllum}} were examined microscopically {{to determine the}} distribution of both druse and raphide idioblasts. <b>Druse</b> <b>crystal</b> idioblasts are small spherical cells found throughout the lamina mostly in sub-epidermal areas. Two types of raphide idioblasts were observed in the leaves of Syngonium podophyllum: the non defensive raphide idioblasts, which are elongated or more or less egg shaped cells usually found embedded in tissues of the leaf margins; and the defensive raphide idioblasts, also elongated cells, but usually found suspended between mesophyll cells in leaf airspaces. The average densities of raphide cells were highest in young leaf than the mature leaf and average densities of druse cells were highest in mature leaf than the young leaf. The raphide and druse cells showed a bilaterally symmetrical distribution during all stages from young to mature leaves but, generally contain more druses than raphides...|$|E

The <b>druse</b> <b>crystal</b> has many functions in plants including calcium regulation, ion balance, tissue support, plant protection, detoxification and light assembly and reflection (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Nakata 2003). Recent research about druse crystals in a C 4 plant, Amaranthus hybridus L., revealed that the plant used calcium oxalate crystals as a non-atmospheric carbon source in photosynthesis assimilation during the day, especially in drought condition (Tooulakou et al. 2016). In the daytime, druse crystals were degraded and provided subsidiary carbon used in photosynthesis under ambient conditions that caused stomatal closure (for preventing water loss). Moreover, these crystals were recovered during the night as a biochemical carbon reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Calcium {{crystals}} {{are evident}} {{in many parts of}} anther. There is little literature about differentiation of crystal-containing cells and crystal formation during anther development. Petunia hybrid grandiflora Flower buds collected at different developmental stages were fixed and studied. The results revealed that young anthers are tetrasporangiate and {{in each of the four}} corners, the primary parietal layer externally and primary sporogenous cells internally, arise from periclinal divisions of the archeosporial cells. In the young anther, septum and connective cells contain calcium crystals as druse. At stomium, there is an arrangement of a band of 8 - 14 cells just beneath the epidermis which densely stain and lack visible vacuoles. During the division of sporogenous cells and the formation of crescent shaped tissue, no crystals are seen in hypodermal cells. In this stage, druse crystals become larger in connective tissue. While meiosis is occurring, the hypodermal cells of stomium are elongated, yet crystals are not observable. During pollen development, hypodermal cells degenerate and sand crystals appear.

The absence of regular vittae and the presence of irregular vittae and dispersed <b>druse</b> <b>crystals</b> further support the exclusion of Steganotaenia from the subfamily Apioideae but support its hypothesized relation to the Saniculoideae, where large rib ducts combined with irregular vittae (branching or anastomosing) and dispersed <b>druse</b> <b>crystals</b> are typical.

40|$|Marama bean, Tylosema species, is an underutilised {{indigenous}} oilseed legume from Southern Africa. It is a {{very good}} source of protein, similar to soya beans and peanuts. The marama plant is very hardy and drought-tolerant. Therefore, it has great potential as an alternative to these other oilseed legumes. To facilitate the use of marama protein as a functional ingredient in food systems, the knowledge of protein composition and structure as well as its functionality is indispensable. In this study, the physicochemical characteristics of marama protein were determined. Specifically, the microstructure of protein bodies in two species (T. esculentum and T. fassoglense) of marama beans was compared with that of soya beans. Furthermore, the composition and functionality (thermal and rheological properties) of marama bean protein were determined and compared with soya bean protein. Marama bean parenchyma cells showed clustered spherical protein bodies surrounded by lipid bodies similar to soya beans. T. esculentum seemed to contain smaller sized (4 ± 2 μm) protein bodies per parenchyma cell as compared with T. fassoglense (7 ± 4 μm). Marama protein bodies contained spherical globoid and <b>druse</b> <b>crystal</b> inclusions, which were absent in soya bean protein. P, K, Mg and Ca were the major minerals in marama, which probably originated mainly from storage protein sites. The high level of tyrosine in marama protein, almost 3 times that of soya protein, was confirmed. Marama protein was also slightly richer in proline compared to soya protein. By SDS-PAGE, marama protein exhibited fewer protein bands compared iii with soya. The patterns of these bands in marama under non-reducing and reducing conditions were similar, suggesting an absence of disulphide bonds. The vicilin (7 S) and acidic 11 S subunits seemed to be absent in marama. This is most unusual in legume proteins. Only a major basic legumin (11 S) (20 kDa), medium (63 kDa) and high (148 kDa) molecular weight protein bands were separated for marama. The pI’s of most polypeptides in the marama proteome map were between 6 - 10, indicating that marama protein is a more basic protein compared to soya protein. Marama protein was characterised by one major endothermal transition (96 oC) compared to soya which had two. Marama protein was highly extensible compared to soya protein and even wheat gluten. It was also very adhesive compared to gluten. However, dynamic oscillatory data indicated that marama protein has a less stable protein structure than gluten. With added peroxidase, the storage modulus (G’) of marama protein dough increased with time, suggesting the formation of new and strong protein networks. These new networks probably resulted from tyrosine oxidation and crosslinking. SDS-PAGE and HPLC/MS data from incubated doughs suggest that dityrosine crosslinks may be important in increasing the structural stability of marama protein. The protein body structure of marama is similar to soya in terms of spherical shape and localisation within the parenchyma cells. However, the protein composition of marama is very different from that of soya. Marama protein thus offers new opportunities of protein utilisation in food and non-food systems. Marama protein may be employed in baked goods, especially in the production of gluten-free products. The high extensibility of marama protein may be useful for gas retention in bread dough. The use of marama protein may be explored in the production of microspheres/nanoparticles. Potential applications for these particles may be in bioplastic films. Marama protein nanoparticles may also be used as a bioadhesive due to its high adhesiveness compared to soya protein and even gluten. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

Wu and Kuo-Huang (1997) have studied calcium crystals in the leaves of Humulus scandens and they have reported only calcium carbonate crystals in its leaves. The differences in the types of calcium crystals between these two different species of the genus Humulus is not surprising. Because, although crystal formation in plants is mostly under genetic control (Ilarslan et al. 2001), the location, size and other properties of crystals may be effected by physical, chemical and biological conditions such as light, temperature, pH, ion concentration and herbivory (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Molano-Flores 2001; Kuo-Huang et al. 2007). Moreover, features of calcium crystals in the leaves of Humulu s may be useful in intra genus classification.|$|R
30|$|Poisonous {{compounds}} in the studied species are either alkaloids or glycosides. Five {{of the eight}} poisonous plant species contain glycosidic compounds, and have <b>druse</b> <b>crystals.</b> However, three of the studied plants have alkaloids as poisonous compounds, {{and all of them}} are devoid of calcium oxalate crystals (Table  2). Therefore, {{the results of the present}} study point out the correlation between the kinds of toxic substance and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the studied plants. However, in the study of Doaigey (1991), investigating calcium oxalate crystals in the sixteen species of poisonous plants, calcium oxalate crystals have been reported in the four of the seven species having alkaloids and in the three of the seven species containing glycosidic compounds. The results of the Doaigey’s study don’t confirm the findings of our study related with alkaloids and glycosides. Consequently there is no sufficient evidence to prove the relationship between the kind of toxic substances and occurrence, types and distribution of calcium oxalate crystals in plant organs.|$|R

A parenchymatous mesocarp with vascular bundles and scattered <b>druse</b> <b>crystals</b> of calcium oxalate is derived from the ground tissue of the ovary wall.

The outer surface of the stone is of taxonomic significance, being smooth in C. ilicifolia and longitudinally ribbed in C. tinifolia.

40|$|Anthurium andreanum Lind. is a perennial,. {{herbaceous}} monocotyledon in {{the family}} Araceae with cordate leaves and flowers. The commercial "flower" is an inflorescence consisting of conspicuous bract (spathe) and protruding rachis (spadix), on which minute perfect flowers are borne helically. The flowers are protogynous; the stigma is receptive before the pollen is shed. Anatomically, the spathe has a uniseriate upper and lower epidermis,one or two layers of hypodermal cells, and 10 to 12 layers of spongy parenchyma cells. Anthocyanin is localized in the hypodermal cells. The leaf blade {{is similar to the}} spathe, except for two layers of palisade parenchyma cells immediately below the upper epidermis. Venation is netted. Chloroplasts are dispersed throughout the mesophyll but are more concentrated in the palisade cells. The peduncle, petiole, and stem are typically monocotyledonous in structure. Epidermal cells cover the cortex, a layer of sclerified parenchyma cells, and the ground tissue. Vascular bundles are dispersed throughout the groundtissue. Roots are cylindrical, fleshy, epiphytic, and adventitious. The epidermis is developed as a velamen. Raphide and <b>druse</b> <b>crystals</b> are found throughout the plant.

40|$|Claoxylon and Micrococca are {{the only}} Euphorbiaceae genera that have rough dried leaves (fresh ones are smooth) because of {{protruding}} styloid (needle-like) crystals more or less perpendicular to the leaf surface, which perforate the epidermis and cuticle. A broad leaf anatomical study of the subtribes Claoxylinae, the monogeneric Lobaniliinae, and Mercurialis of the Mercurialinae (95 of a possible 235 species in all six genera) showed that styloids are present in Claoxylon, Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca, and lacking in Claoxylopsis and Mercurialis. Contrary to Claoxylon, the dried leaves of Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca are not rough, because the styloids do not perforate the epidermis during drying and therefore herbarium leaves generally remain smooth. The presence of styloids supports a clade in a recent molecular phylogenetic study that unites subtribes Claoxylinae and Lobaniliinae as Claoxylinae s. l. Mercurialis (no styloids) is sister to all other taxa (with styloids) in the monophyletic Claoxylinae s. l.

40|$|Considering the {{widespread}} occurrence of oxalate {{in nature and}} its broad impact {{on a host of}} organisms, it is surprising that so {{little is known about the}} turnover of this important acid. In plants, oxalate oxidase is the most well studied enzyme capable of degrading oxalate, but not all plants possess this activity. Recently, an Acyl Activating Enzyme 3 (AAE 3), encoding an oxalyl-CoA synthetase, was identified in Arabidopsis. AAE 3 has been proposed to catalyze the first step in an alternative pathway of oxalate degradation. Whether this enzyme and proposed pathway is important to other plants is unknown. Here, we identify the Medicago truncatula AAE 3 (MtAAE 3) and show that it encodes an oxalyl-CoA synthetase activity exhibiting high activity against oxalate with a Km = 81 ± 9 μM and Vmax = 19 ± 0. 9 μmoles min- 1 mg protein- 1. GFP-MtAAE 3 localization suggested that this enzyme functions within the cytosol of the cell. Mtaae 3 knock-down line showed a reduction in its ability to degrade oxalate into CO 2. This reduction in the capacity to degrade oxalate resulted in the accumulation of <b>druse</b> <b>crystals</b> of calcium oxalate in the Mtaae 3 knock-down line and an increased susceptibility to oxalate-secreting phytopathogens such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
