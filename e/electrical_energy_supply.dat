40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} change in {{metabolic}} energy required to maintain the signalling activity of neurons {{in the presence of}} an external electric field. We have analysed the Hodgkin–Huxley type conductance based fast spiking neuron model as electrical circuit by changing the frequency and amplitude of the applied electric field. The study has shown that, the presence of electric field increases the membrane potential, <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and metabolic energy consumption. As the amplitude of applied electric field increases by keeping a constant frequency, the membrane potential increases and consequently the <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and metabolic energy consumption increases. On increasing the frequency of the applied field, the peak value of membrane potential after depolarization gradually decreases as a result <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> decreases which results in a lower rate of hydrolysis of ATP molecules...|$|E

30|$|The {{electrical}} energy problem in Nigeria can be broadly categorized into three main pillars: (1) quantity; (2) reliability; and (3) efficiency. Quantity reflects the supply–demand imbalance, where what is generated and supplied is non-optimal. The supply–demand gap {{is believed to}} be the biggest in the world. Reliability pertains to the frequency or regularity of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> whereas efficiency stems from the overall effectiveness of the system to wheel power to the end-users from the source, and the quality of the supplied electricity to be effectively used. Nigeria continues to be ranked as a developing nation, on the whole, due to its poor <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b> Her generating capacity, which is less than 5000  MW, is much less than the energy produced by less-populous countries, e.g., South Africa, whose capacity is about 50, 000  MW. Nigeria produces about 40  kW per thousand people, whereas South Africa produces 270  kW per thousand people. The several phases of {{electrical energy}} utilization, that is, generation, transmission, and distribution continue to account for about only 1 % of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It has been estimated that GDP growth could be increased by as much as 11 % if <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> was regular. Several reforms initiated by past and present government administrations are yet to be fully and more efficiently realized.|$|E

Hence, using some electrical means (e.g. sound waves, RF waves, Inductive heating, DC Heating, etc.), oil can be recovered from the reservoirs at much lower cost and with enhanced efficiency {{as compared with the}} aforementioned conventional EOR methods. The basic function of EEOR process is to increase the mobility of the oil by reducing its viscosity which in turn would help the oil to easily move towards the production well.

40|$|Effective {{energy storage}} {{technologies}} represent {{one of the}} key elements to solving the growing challenges of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> of the 21 st century. Several energy storage systems are available, from ones that are technologically mature to others still at a research stage. Each technology has its inherent limitations that make its use economically or practically feasible only for specific applications. The present paper aims at integrating hydrogen generation into compressed air energy storage systems to avoid natural gas combustion or thermal energy storage. A proper design of such a hybrid storage system could provide high roundtrip efficiencies together with enhanced flexibility thanks to the possibility of providing additional energy outputs (heat, cooling, and hydrogen as a fuel), in a distributed energy storage framework. Such a system could be directly connected to the power grid at the distribution level to reduce power and energy intermittence problems related to renewable energy generation. Similarly, it could be located close to the user (e. g., office buildings, commercial centers, industrial plants, hospitals, etc.). Finally, it could be integrated in decentralized energy generation systems to reduce the peak electricity demand charges and energy costs, to increase power generation efficiency, to enhance the security of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> and to facilitate the market penetration of small renewable energy systems. Different configurations have been investigated (simple hybrid storage system, regenerate system, multistage system) demonstrating the compressed air and hydrogen storage systems effectiveness in improving energy source flexibility and efficiency, and possibly in reducing the costs of energy supply. Round-trip efficiency up to 65 % can be easily reached. The analysis is conducted through a mixed theoretical-numerical approach, which allows the definition of the most relevant physical parameters affecting the system performance...|$|E
