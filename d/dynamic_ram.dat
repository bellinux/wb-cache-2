40|$|WORKING PAPER No. 05 / 2012  The paper {{focuses on}} the {{robustness}} of rankings of academic journal quality and research impact in general, and in Economics, in particular, based on the widely-used Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science citations database (ISI). The paper analyses 299 leading international journals in Economics using quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights {{the similarities and differences}} in various RAMs, which are based on alternative transformations of citations. All existing RAMs to date have been static, so two new <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAMs</b> are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time and escalating journal self citations. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to determine When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. (2011 a, b, c)). The RAMs are grouped in four distinct classes that include impact factor, mean citations and non-citations, journal policy, number of high quality papers, and journal influence and article influence. These classes include the most widely used RAMs, namely the classic 2 -year impact factor including journal self citations (2 YIF), 2 -year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2 YIF*), 5 -year impact factor including journal self citations (5 YIF), Eigenfactor (or Journal Influence), Article Influence, h-index, and PI-BETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors). As all existing RAMs to date have been static, two new <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAMs</b> are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time (5 YD 2 = 5 YIF/ 2 YIF) and Escalating Self Citations. We highlight robust rankings based on the harmonic mean of the ranks of RAMs across the 4 classes. It is shown that emphasizing the 2 -year impact factor of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal quality, impact and influence relative to the harmonic mean of the ranks...|$|R

First, technology trends in low-voltage <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAMs</b> (DRAMs) and static RAMs (SRAMs) are reviewed {{and the challenges}} of lowvoltage RAMs in terms of cell signal charge are clarified, including the necessary threshold voltage, V T, and its variations in the MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) of RAM cells and sense amplifiers, leakage currents (subthreshold current and gate-tunnel current), and speed variations resulting from design parameter variations. Second, developments in conventional RAM cells and emerging cells, such as DRAM gain cells and leakage-immune SRAM cells, are discussed from the viewpoints of cell area, operating voltage, and leakage currents of MOSFETs. Third, the concepts proposed to date to reduce subthreshold current and the advantages of RAMs with respect to reducing the subthreshold current are summarized, including their applications to RAM circuits to reduce the current in standby and active modes, exemplified by DRAMs. After this, design issues in other peripheral circuits, such as sense amplifiers and low-voltage supporting circuits, are discussed, as are power management to suppress speed variations and reduce the power of power-aware systems, and testing.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{study on the}} effect of bottom- and top-oxide thicknesses on the current conduction and the di-electric breakdown of oxide/nitride/oxide (ONO) multi-layer dielectrics. An abrupt reduction in current is observed when the oxide that is contiguous to the anode is thicker than 3 nm. This leads us to conclude that the thick oxide (> 3 nm) im-pedes hole injection from anode into nitride. The injected charge-to-breakdown (QBD) and the time-to-breakdown (TBD) are measured to study the breakdown mechanism. We observe that a substantial increase in TBD occurs in spite of the reduc-tion in QBD when the thick oxide is contiguous to anode. This phenomenon is explained by a hole-induced breakdown model for the ONO structure with thin bottom- and top-oxides (< 3 nm). Hole injection is suppressed by the thick oxide that is contiguous to anode. The increase in TBD is attributed to the reduction in injected holes. We conclude that the di-electric breakdown of the ONO structure with the thin oxides is induced by injected holes. We also observe that the ther-mal activation energy of the TSD changes at 3 nm in bottom-oxide thickness under negative gate bias. Therefore, this value of 3 nm is determined as a threshold thickness for the change ofthe breakdown mechanism.
