5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach <b>for</b> <b>low-income,</b> farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services <b>for</b> <b>low-income</b> families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods.

5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda.

Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development.
