40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to give a}} self-contained development of dividing theory (also called forking theory) in a strongly homogeneous structure. Dividing is a combinatorial property of the invariant relations on a structure that have yielded deep results for the models of so-called “simple ” first-order theories.

Naturally, some background in first-order model theory helps to understand these motivating results; however virtually no knowledge of logic is assumed in this paper.

Traditionally, <b>geometrical</b> <b>stability</b> theory {{is a collection of}} results that apply to definable relations on arbitrary models of a complete first-order theory.

Otherwise, various unfavorable phenomena manifest during the grinding processes and become serious obstacles to achieving that high quality and productivity. These phenomena are associated with the fundamental stabilities of the {{centerless grinding}} system, so it is essential to keep the system stable by setting up the appropriate grinding conditions. This paper describes the development of a model for finding the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy the three stability criteria of centerless grinding systems: (1) work rotation stability for safe operations; (2) <b>geometrical</b> rounding <b>stability</b> for better roundness; and (3) dynamic system stability for chatter-free grinding.

The paper demonstrates that the developed model, named Opt-Setup Master, can generate the optimum setup conditions to ensure safe operations, better roundness and chatter-free grinding.
