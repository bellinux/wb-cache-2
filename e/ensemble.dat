5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an <b>ensemble</b> of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} current code of {{practice}} in the climate sciences to routinely create climate model <b>ensembles</b> as <b>ensembles</b> of opportunity from the newest phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). We give a two-step argument to rethink this process. First, the differences between generations of <b>ensembles</b> corresponding to different CMIP phases in key climate quantities are not large enough to warrant an automatic separation into generational <b>ensembles</b> for CMIP 3 and CMIP 5. Second, we suggest that climate model <b>ensembles</b> cannot continue to be mere <b>ensembles</b> of opportunity but should always {{be based on a}} transparent scientific decision process. If <b>ensembles</b> can be constrained by observation, then they should be constructed as target <b>ensembles</b> that are specifically tailored to a physical question. If model <b>ensembles</b> cannot be constrained by observation, then they should be constructed as cross-generational <b>ensembles,</b> including all available model data to enhance structural model diversity and to better sample the underlying uncertainties. To facilitate this, CMIP should guide the necessarily ongoing process of updating experimental protocols for the evaluation and documentation of coupled models. With an emphasis on easy access to model data and facilitating the filtering of climate model data across all CMIP generations and experiments, our community could return to the underlying idea of using model data <b>ensembles</b> to improve uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and cross-institutional exchange...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a family of}} rotationally invariant random matrix <b>ensembles</b> characterized by a parameter λ. While λ = 1 corresponds to well-known critical <b>ensembles,</b> we show that λ ̸ = 1 describes “Lévy like ” <b>ensembles,</b> characterized by power law eigenvalue densities. For λ> 1 the density is bounded, as in Gaussian <b>ensembles,</b> but λ < 1 describes <b>ensembles</b> characterized by densities with long tails. In particular, the model allows us to evaluate, {{in terms of a}} novel family of orthogonal polynomials, the eigenvalue correlations for Lévy like <b>ensembles.</b> These correlations differ qualitatively from those in either the Gaussian or the critical <b>ensembles.</b> PACS numbers: 05. 40. -a, 05. 60. -k, 05. 90. +mRotationally invariant family of Lévy like random matrix <b>ensembles</b> 2 1.
