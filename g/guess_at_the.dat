5|$|The {{first round}} was {{broadcast}} February 14, 2011, {{and the second}} round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter. Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Daily Double location was correct. At {{the end of the}} first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a complex}} set of reasons, {{conditions}} in Western Europe began to improve after 700. In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy. The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely any different from their barbarian Germanic ancestors. Their kingdom was weak, hopelessly divided, and ruled by a king who was barely distinguishable from a peasant. Impossible to <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, {{but by the end of}} the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
500|$|Moore's {{work was}} commented on by Byron's close friend, John Hobhouse, who noted that [...] "Moore {{had not the}} remotest <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> real reason which induced Lord B. {{at that time to}} prefer having no Englishman {{immediately}} or constantly near him." [...] Regardless of Moore's bias against the lower class and Byron's spending time with other boys during his times in Greece, Byron was close to Giraud while the two were together.|$|E

60|$|Jerry {{had only}} <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{identity}} of the leader, but he had hit upon the truth.|$|R
500|$|Mannix felt it {{was nearly}} {{impossible}} for any writer to escape imparting some anthropomorphism in such a novel, as a human must <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way an animal's mind may work and what motivations it may have. He felt animals think differently from humans, though are capable of reason on a [...] "rudimentary level compared to a human." [...] In explaining his descriptions of hunting, {{he said it was}} hard to decide how a hound with non-human scenting ability interprets and responds to scents while tracking another animal.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Durst {{was tapped}} to write songs for Britney Spears, and later {{said that he}} was in a {{relationship}} with her. Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that [...] "I just <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rickman said: [...] "I {{can only}} <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{pressures}} of funding an independent theatre company in New York, but calling this production [...] "postponed" [...] does not disguise {{the fact that}} it has been cancelled. This is censorship born out of fear, and the New York Theatre Workshop, the Royal Court, New York audiences - all of us are the losers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ralph did not {{understand}} the words but he <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> meaning, and said, smiling, [...] "I am quite content to remain where I am." ...|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the terror}} in her eyes, {{and he spoke}} quickly. All the time he found himself {{wondering}} how {{it was that she}} was <b>guessing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> truth.|$|R

2500|$|In late June 2008, McCain said {{he favored}} {{nationwide}} limits on carbon emissions from cars, saying [...] "my goal {{would be to}} see a federal standard that every state could embrace". In mid-July, McCain, regarding whether states such as California {{should be permitted to}} set tough greenhouse gas limits on vehicles, that [...] "It's hard for me to tell states that they can't impose ... whatever standards that would apply within their own states." [...] He said [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, I support the states being able to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Our {{opinion is}} that Mr. Travis has won more low gross, low net and open tourneys than any other living golfer. [...] He was {{practically}} unbeatable for a stretch of six years from 1898 to 1904 during which time he played in double or triple the number of events entered by either John Ball or Chick Evans. [...] A <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> number of his trophies would place it over five hundred and perhaps nearer to a thousand. [...] In 1901, Travis was national champion and in 1915 he was again the Metropolitan champion. [...] His southern victories were numerous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noam Chomsky {{delivered}} {{an influential}} critique of radical behaviorism {{on the grounds}} that it could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition. Martin Seligman and colleagues discovered that the conditioning of dogs led to outcomes ("learned helplessness") that opposed the predictions of behaviorism. Skinner's behaviorism did not die, perhaps in part because it generated successful practical applications. Edward C. Tolman advanced a hybrid [...] "cognitive behaviorial" [...] model, most notably with his 1948 publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> location of food at the end of a modified maze.|$|E
6000|$|The {{biography}} {{observes that}} portions of this letter [...] "read like the tired moaning of a wounded creature." [...] <b>Guesses</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of the}} wound are permissible; we will hazard one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am happy}} your gracious Majesty," [...] said the Duke of Buckingham, [...] "has arrived at that conclusion, though I {{could never have}} <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> road by which you {{attained}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|Osmond {{returned}} to the Duke's chamber, and relieved his father's guard, while Richard slept soundly on, little <b>guessing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plots of his enemies, or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> schemes of his faithful subjects for his protection.|$|R
2500|$|The cantata was {{a highly}} {{successful}} genre in the early 18th century. The French cantata, which {{should not be confused}} with the Italian or the German cantata, was [...] "invented" [...] in 1706 by the poet Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day, such as Montéclair, Campra, and Clérambault. Cantatas were Rameau's first contact with dramatic music. The modest forces the cantata required meant it was a genre within the reach of a composer who was still unknown. Musicologists can only <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dates of Rameau's six surviving cantatas, and the names of the librettists are unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The Athletic Times {{described}} Roose as [...] "dexterous though daring, valiant though volatile". Spectators, {{observes the}} DWB, [...] "could only gaze in wonder at his prehensile grip, the immense {{power of his}} punch, and the prodigious length of his goal kicks; they could only <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> uncanny intuition by which he divined the aims of his opponents, the swift agile mind that worked behind the small, narrow eyes." [...] Geraint Jenkins, an Aberystwyth historian who wrote a brief biographical sketch of the goalkeeper in 2000, adds that Roose boasted [...] "sharp eyesight, startling reflexes, competitive instinct and reckless bravery", and was altogether [...] "an extraordinarily daunting opponent".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} swamp forests {{have almost}} entirely been removed as the plain {{has been converted}} to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including {{a large number of}} fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we can only <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area [...] would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.|$|E
50|$|Part of the {{sensation}} the novel created {{was due to}} the anonymity with which it was published. Gaskell claimed that on occasion she had even joined in with discussions making <b>guesses</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> authorship.|$|R
50|$|Although {{federal courts}} may often be {{called upon to}} {{interpret}} the law of a state, they are really just <b>guessing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conclusions a state court would arrive at when confronted by the same question.|$|R

2500|$|Compulsory voting {{has also}} been {{promoted}} for its collective benefits. [...] It becomes difficult for coercion {{to be used to}} prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) as often happens under other voting systems. The compulsion requirement also needs to be kept in proportion: jury duty and compulsory military service are vastly more onerous citizen's compulsions [...] than attending a local voting booth once every few years. Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a system of compulsory voting is a simple matter of logistics, that is, to facilitate the smooth and orderly process of an election. Every year in countries that do not have compulsory voting election officials have to <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> numbers of voters who might turn out – this often depends on the vagaries of the weather. Often voters are disenfranchied in those countries when voting officials err and not enough voting booths are provided. Long queues can result with voters being turned away at the close of polling not having had their chance to exercise their democratic right to vote.|$|E

60|$|But Carlisle {{people knew}} nothing of this--would have thought him tinged with mild lunacy if they had known. To them, he was just the shy, simple farmer he appeared. They never knew or <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> real Jasper Dale.|$|R
60|$|We {{were very}} civil; {{but there were}} a good many polite struggles for the {{exclusive}} possession of Ellen, whom both parties viewed as their individual right; and her unselfish good-humour and brightness must have carried her over more worries than we <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R
60|$|The jaws of <b>the</b> {{listener}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ventilator clicked {{together with}} a vicious snap.

His muscular fingers clenched until the nails bit into the palms.|$|R
60|$|Wild as this <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> truth {{undoubtedly}} was, it had one merit: {{it might}} easily {{be put to}} the test.|$|E

6000|$|Milt grinned irresistibly. [...] "Not a friend. But I'm {{going to}} make 'em. I'm going to take up engineering, and some French, I <b>guess,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{university}} there." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{person who}} <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> exhibition's nature was The Times art critic Rachel Campbell-Johnston. Four days before Januszczak's piece was published, she praised the collection, but cautioned [...] "Don’t be {{surprised}} if the entire band is a fabrication — down to its references on internet sites." ...|$|R
60|$|Afterwards {{we played}} 'Up, Jenkins'. That {{was the one}} game we played with the peasants, except that {{exciting}} one of theirs, which consists in shouting in rapid succession your <b>guesses</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> number of fingers rapidly spread out and shut into the hands again upon the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} thank you before my father, but neither could I {{let you go}} without a word," [...] she said, with a quiet {{composure}} which, because she must have <b>guessed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> struggle within him, was the badge of courage. [...] "You have won my undying gratitude, and----" ...|$|R
