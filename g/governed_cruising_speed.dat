40|$|Speed of {{locomotion}} {{plays an}} important role in an animal’s biology and ecology and is of particular interest in aquatic animals. Determining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of shark—for which such data are scarce—may help to better understand their interactions with prey, the size of the home ranges they maintain, their energetic costs and how they interact with their environment through sensory perception. In this study, the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of a range of different shark species were measured using stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS). The relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> and fork length, species, order, habitat, trophic level, temperature and tail shape was then modelled. Fork length and species best explained the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of the eight species of shark studied: Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Furgaleus macki, Carcharhinus obesus, Mustelus antarcticus, Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Parascyllium variolatum. This linear model had a slope that did not differ statistically from that of the theoretical model proposed by Weihs (Scale effects in animal locomotion, Academic Press, New York, pp 333 – 338, 1977), which suggests that the relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and length appears to be dominated by energetics. The results suggest that existing allometric estimates of <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> can be improved by defining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> for each species as a function of length. Currently, literature presents <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> data for only a few species of shark; therefore, we provide a second, generalised model, which predicts <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> as a function of length and tail shape. The length + tail shape model was selected based on its generality and accuracy in estimating shark <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> obtained from acoustic tags. This length + tail shape model was significantly better than a length only model; it explained a further 76  % of the variation in <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> derived from stereo-BRUVS and acoustic tagging data than a length only model. The more accurate prediction of the length + tail shape model is most likely because tail shape is correlated with a number of ecological factors. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a coupled {{longitudinal}} and lateral control strategy for an autonomous automotive vehicle is proposed. The proposed control scheme {{consists of a}} lateral guidance module based on a NonLinear Model-based Predictive Controller (NLMPC) and a <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> generation and regulation module. A cruise speed-profile generator allows the calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> which preserves the lateral stability of the vehicle during lateral maneuvers. The calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile is done considering road geometry as well as lateral dynamics criteria. The handling of both longitudinal and lateral dynamics {{in addition to the}} calculation of the limit <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile by considering lateral stability criteria illustrate the interest of the proposed approach. The developed control architecture is tested through simulation and shows good performance for guidance at high <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R
