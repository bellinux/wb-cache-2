2500|$|STS-131 (ISS {{assembly}} flight 19A) was a NASA Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS). [...] launched on 5 April 2010 at 6:21am from <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> launch pad 39A, and landed at 9:08am on 20 April 2010 on runway 33 at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> Shuttle Landing Facility. The mission marked the longest flight for space shuttle Discovery.|$|R
5|$|Flight day 9 {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} preparations for landing, and the landing itself. Atlantiss deorbit burn {{was performed on}} orbit 128 at around 11:00amEST (16:00UTC), leading to a landing at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{facilities}} are research, construction and communication centers to help its missions. Some facilities serve {{more than one}} application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line railroad at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> and own special aircraft, for instance two Boeing 747 that transport Space Shuttle orbiter.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2001, NASA chose Lockheed Martin as {{the primary}} {{contractor}} for the spacecraft's fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission's instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during MRO's construction, and the spacecraft was moved to John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> on May 1, 2005 to prepare it for launch.|$|E

5|$|STS-74 was {{the fourth}} mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the second docking of the Space Shuttle with Mir. Space Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of Atlantis back at Kennedy. It was the second {{in a series of}} seven {{straight}} missions to the station flown by Atlantis.|$|E

5|$|The Apollo 1 Command Module {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions {{were delivered}} by North American Aviation to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> with long lists of equipment problems {{which had to}} be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg was {{assigned}} as Payload Specialist on STS-51B Challenger (April 29–May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center,</b> Florida, {{and returned to}} land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard Challenger conducted investigations into crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal and human medical monitoring.|$|E
5000|$|STS-112 (ISS {{assembly}} flight 9A) was an 11-day {{space shuttle}} {{mission to the}} International Space Station (ISS) flown by [...] Space Shuttle Atlantis was launched on 7 October 2002 at 19:45 UTC from the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> launch pad 39B to deliver the 28,000 pound Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment to the Space Station. Ending a 4.5-million-mile journey, Atlantis landed at 15:44 UTC on 18 October 2002 on runway 33 at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> Shuttle Landing Facility.|$|R

5|$|Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee {{were buried}} at Arlington National Cemetery. Ed White was buried at West Point Cemetery {{on the grounds}} of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Their names are among those of several astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty, listed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. President Jimmy Carter awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously to Grissom on October 1, 1978. President Bill Clinton awarded it to White and Chaffee on December 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center.</b> They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who {{would be on the}} NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
50|$|The 7-day, 23-hour, 15-minute, 55-second flight {{ended on}} February 11, 1984 with a {{successful}} landing at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> Shuttle Landing Facility. This {{marked the first}} landing of a spacecraft at its launch site. Challenger completed 127 orbits and traveled 2.8 million miles.|$|R

25|$|STS-129 (ISS {{assembly}} flight ULF3) was a NASA Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS). Atlantis was launched on November 16, 2009 at 14:28 EST, and landed at 09:44 EST on November 27, 2009 on runway 33 at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center's</b> Shuttle Landing Facility.|$|R
5|$|STS-125 {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Discovery with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions {{resulted in a}} change in mission ordering, and the orbiter was changed to Atlantis on 8 January 2007. The crew of Atlantis went to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> for the Crew Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with the orbiter and the hardware they would be using during the flight.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Center</b> on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E
