40|$|Objectives: To compare {{weekly and}} three-weekly {{cisplatin}} {{as an adjunct}} to radiation therapy in high-risk early-stage cervical cancer after surgery with regard to treatment compliance. Material and Method: From June 1 st, 2003 to February 29 th, 2004, the authors performed a randomized trial of radiotherapy in combination with two concurrent chemotherapy regimens- weekly or three-weekly cisplatin- in patients with high-risk cervical cancer FIGO stage I-IIA after surgery. Women with primary invasive squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix were enrolled. The patients also had to have an absolute neutrophil count of at least 1, 500 cells per cubic millimeter, a platelet count of at least 75, 000 cells per cubic millimeter, a creatinine clearance higher than 40 milliliter per minute, and adequate hepatic function. All patients received external-beam radiotherapy according to a strict proto-col. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of two chemotherapy regimens: 75 mg per square meter of cisplatin on days 1, 22, 43 and 64 or every three weeks for 4 cycles (group 1) or 40 mg per square meter of cisplatin per week for six cycles (group 2).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Treatment with {{antidepressants}} and antipsychotics, though effective, is unspecific {{as agents}} that differ greatly in their biochemical and pharmacological actions have {{virtually the same}} efficacy. Half of the patients with initial improvement show incomplete response, while {{a large proportion of}} patients exhibit a refractory clinical picture which is resistant to all treatment modalities. METHODS: Our analyses were based on a reference study of 2, 848 depressive inpatients under monotherapeutic treatment with 7 different antidepressants or placebo, along with a naturalistic study of depressive and schizophrenic patients (296 inpatients, 363 outpatients) under today's "standard" polypharmaceutic treatment regimens. RESULTS: The empirical data suggested the following predictors of response: (1) severity at baseline, (2) early onset of improvement, (3) unwanted side-effects, and (4) medical comorbidity. A combination of these predictors with Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) methods has direct clinical relevance. DISCUSSION: Evidence-based approaches to personalized treatment help improving the unsatisfactory situation patients and clinicians are faced with, given today's <b>incomplete</b> <b>treatments</b> {{and the fact that the}} mechanisms by which antidepressants and antipsychotics ultimately exert their therapeutic effects are only marginally understood.

The 5 -year {{survival rate}} also increased, from 37. 5 % to 63. 6 %. Between May 1990 and May 2001, 74 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma were treated at our hospital. Median age was 17 years (range, 7 - 63 years). Inadequate surgical margins, poor histologic response to chemotherapy, advanced stage of disease, and <b>incomplete</b> <b>treatment</b> were strongly associated with poor prognosis.

40|$|Rotational mixing {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for explaining the gradual depletion of light elements from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence. However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on <b>incomplete</b> <b>treatments</b> of angular momentum (AM) transport in stellar interiors, which do not predict the rotational evolution of open clusters. In order to produce new mixing calculations, we modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an additional source of AM transport, a necessary ingredient for explaining the open cluster rotation pattern. With this machinery, we show {{for the first time}} that the main sequence evolution of surface rotation in open clusters and the evolving abundance of lithium in cool stars can be simultaneously predicted. Our mixing-derived core-envelope coupling strengths agree well with previous work, confirming the reliability of our mixing calculations. Using Li abundances, we argue that the timescale for core-envelope re-coupling during the main sequence is a strong function of mass, thus placing an important constraint on models seeking to identify the mechanism responsible for core-envelope coupling. We discuss implications of this finding for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic fields as agents of AM transport...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} post-surgical medical treatment with GnRHa in patients with DIE (Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis) that received complete or incomplete surgery laparoscopic excision. Methods Hundred fifty-nine patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis of the cul-de-sac and of the rectovaginal septum with pelvic pain undergoing laparoscopic surgery in academic tertiary-care medical center. Eighty patients underwent complete laparoscopic excision of DIE (Arm A) while 79 patients underwent incomplete surgery (Arm B). After surgery each surgical arm was randomized in two groups: no treatment groups 1 A [40 pts] and 1 B [40 pts] and GnRHa treatment for 6 months groups 2 A [40 pts] and 2 B [39 pts]. Pain recurrence {{and quality of life}} were evaluated in follow-up of 12 months and compared between groups. Results No differences were observed between patient groups 1 A and 2 A.

40|$|Abstract. Radio-frequency {{ablation}} (RFA), {{the most}} widely used min-imally invasive ablative therapy of liver cancer, is challenged by a lack of patient-specific planning. In particular, the presence of blood vessels and time-varying thermal diffusivity makes the prediction of the extent of ablated tissue difficult. This may result in <b>incomplete</b> <b>treatments</b> and increased risk of recurrence. In this manuscript, we propose a new model of the biological mechanisms involved in RFA of abdominal tumors based on Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to predict the extent of ablation given probe location and biological parameters. Our method relies on patient images, from which a level set representation of liver geome-try, tumor shape and vessels is extracted. Then, a computational model of heat diffusion, cellular necrosis and blood flow through vessels and liver is solved to estimate the extent of ablated tissue. After quantitative verifications against an analytical solution, we apply our framework on three patients for whom pre- and post-operative CT data were available, yielding promising correlation (point to mesh errors of 4. 3 ± 2. 7, 6. 0 ± 3. 6 and 11. 9 ± 5. 2 mm with ground truth). Implemented on graphics processing units, our method enables for the first time real-time compu-tation: seven minutes of ablation are simulated in eight minutes, which is ≈ 60 × faster than standard finite element methods. Our approach may thus enable model-based planning of RFA in clinical settings. ...|$|R
