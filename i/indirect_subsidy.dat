40|$|The term 'environmentally {{damaging}} subsidies' {{covers all}} sorts of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidies</b> with negative consequences for the environment. This article presents a method to determine {{the environmental impact of}} these subsidies. It combines a microeconomic framework with an environmental impact module. The method is particularly useful for analysing <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidies.</b> These are often hidden, and therefore, not recognized as subsidies. Use of the method will provide a basis for formulating corrective policy. The method is applied to several important subsidies in the Netherlands, in agriculture, energy and transport sectors. The results reveal large environmental effects, which deserve serious attention from policy makers. To illustrate the specific features of the method, its application to a particular subsidy, namely the exemption of excise taxes on aviation fuels, is presented in full detail. ...|$|R

The hope was that this plan would not only reduce the €350 million annual cost drug companies incurred by having to win separate approvals from each member state but also that it would eliminate the protectionist tendencies of sovereign states unwilling to approve new drugs that might compete with those already produced by domestic drug companies.

5000|$|Direct tax {{subsidies}} of any {{church or}} sect or of all churches and sects are undoubtedly prohibited by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution... A tax exemption is, obviously, an <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy...</b> {{it is not}} easy to justify logically the tax exemption provisions... a logical and legal justification of such provisions must be found, and... in interpreting such provisions the court should be very careful not to limit them by such a narrow construction that by the very limitations imposed, constitutionality is adversely affected... It is sound public policy to encourage, by tax exemption as well as by direct subsidy, private undertakings in the fields that are properly within the realm of governmental responsibility. Thus, welfare, charitable and private educational grants and subsidies are valid. All churches that warrant the exemption perform some of these tasks. Therefore, churches can be indirectly subsidized for the performance of these tasks. But this <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> is not for the activities that are peculiarily religious in the sense of dogma or doctrine, but for the many other things all churches do... If the words [...] "religious worship" [...] are given a narrow, limited meaning, so as to require a belief in and adoration of a Supreme Being, then grave doubts would exist as to the constitutionality of the section... If the state cannot constitutionally subsidize religion under the First Amendment, then it cannot subsidize theism. If the state can constitutionally subsidize those functions of religious groups which are not related to [...] "religion" [...] in its narrow sense, then it must subsidize those nontheistic groups which perform the same functions.|$|E

The distribution of subsidies in the private sector is distinctly pro-poor, but this is not true in the public sector.

50|$|Another {{manifestation of}} the redefined role of the church was {{contained}} in measures aimed at reducing, and ultimately eliminating, direct government subsidies to the church. As part of the agreements reached in 1979, the church concurred with plans for its financial independence, to be achieved during a rather lengthy transitional period. At the end of 1987, the government announced that, after a three-year trial period, the church would receive no further direct state aid but would be dependent on what citizens chose to provide, either through donations or by designating {{a portion of their}} income tax for the church. Although the church's exempt status constituted an <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the effect of this new financial status on the church's ability to wield political influence remained to be seen.|$|E
50|$|In case of {{a nuclear}} accident, should claims exceed this primary liability, the PAA {{requires}} all licensees to additionally provide a maximum of $95.8 million into the accident pool - totaling roughly $10 billion if all reactors were required to pay the maximum. This is still not sufficient in the {{case of a}} serious accident, as the cost of damages could exceed $10 billion. According to the PAA, should the costs of accident damages exceed the $10 billion pool, the process for covering the remainder of the costs would be defined by Congress. In 1982, a Sandia National Laboratories study concluded that depending on the reactor size and 'unfavorable conditions' a serious nuclear accident could lead to property damages as high as $314 billion while fatalities could reach 50,000. A recent study found that if only this one relatively ignored <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> for nuclear power was converted to a direct subsidy and diverted to photovoltaic manufacturing, it would result in more installed power and more energy produced by mid-century compared to the nuclear case.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power and}} solar {{photovoltaic}} energy conversion often compete for policy support that governs economic viability. This paper compares current subsidization {{of the nuclear}} industry with providing equivalent support to manufacturing photovoltaic modules. Current U. S. indirect nuclear insurance subsidies are reviewed and the power, energy and financial outcomes of this <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> are compared to equivalent amounts for indirect subsidies (loan guarantees) for photovoltaic manufacturing using a model that holds economic values constant for clarity. The preliminary analysis indicates that if only this one relatively ignored <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> for nuclear power was diverted to photovoltaic manufacturing, it would result in more installed power and more energy produced by mid-century. By 2110 cumulative electricity output of solar would provide an additional 48, 600 Â TWh over nuclear worth $ 5. 3 trillion. The results clearly show that {{not only does the}} indirect insurance liability subsidy play a significant factor for nuclear industry, but also how the transfer of such an <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> from the nuclear to photovoltaic industry would result in more energy over the life cycle of the technologies.

Furthermore, when health is introduced as another source of externalities, the model shows that health expenditure should not always be subsidized.

Second, construction costs grew considerably after the first development phase, slowing the expansion of the system. Third, the current crumbling state of infrastructures and some cases of corruption related to new developments of the system decreased the public appreciation of TransMilenio.

40|$|Conclusions {{show that}} the {{previous}} commitments of city benefits {{is not likely to}} spur a redevelopment of Un ion Station. Because of the high level of risk of the station project, large parking requirements, and the high renovation costs of the station building, substantial subsidy will be required for the station to meet the developer's financial return goals. Examination of previous station attempts shows these subsidies to have traditionally been provided by the city from available federal funds. As these funds have an uncertain future, alternative subsidy sources are required. Alternative subsidies suggested are developer subsidy from increased density on the Union Station site, direct city subsidy, and <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> through the effect of city actions. Each alternative source of subsidy is examined and its impact upon the Union Station project determined. by James E. Thomas, Jr. Thesis (M. Arch. and M. S.)
