5|$|Bindrich {{played in}} {{and won the}} 2011 April Budapest event despite there being no prizes offered there, with 6½/9.

5|$|In 1988 ITV's new morning {{television}} show This Morning, hosted by Richard and Judy, began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock.

Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2010, Chamakh captained the {{national}} team {{for the first time}} in a 2–1 win over the Equatorial Guinea.

5|$|Team World and Team North America {{began the}} event with women's team play. Mirjam Ott and Allison Pottinger played a high-scoring game which {{resulted}} in a win for Ott, and Eve Muirhead scored an early lead over Heather Nedohin and held it to win another point for Team World.

5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Pearl Spring chess tournament on 19–30 October in Nanjing, China, against Anand, Topalov, Vugar Gashimov, Wang Yue, and Étienne Bacrot. This was {{the only}} tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, {{at the time the}} top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. With early wins over Bacrot, Wang Yue, and Topalov with white, Carlsen took the early lead, {{extending}} his winning streak with white in Nanjing to eight. This streak was halted by a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> Anand in round seven, but in the penultimate round Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{joined a}} team that had won three La Liga titles {{in a row and}} two Champions League titles in three years, and one that {{featured}} the likes of Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and David Villa. He made his debut in the second leg of the Supercopa de España, coming on as a substitute against Real Madrid. Barcelona won the tie 3–2 and 5–4 on aggregate. He scored his first goal in a 2–0 win against Porto as Barcelona won the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, and his first league goal on his league debut against Villarreal. He went on to score three more league goals in the month of September, including a late equaliser in the 2–2 away <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> Valencia.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against England {{in the opening}} game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his {{preferred}} position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport team-mate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1956–57, his {{penultimate}} {{season for}} Victoria, Loxton—aged nearly 36—scored 134 and took 2/30 to orchestrate an innings victory over South Australia {{in the second}} match of the summer. In the penultimate match of the season, which effectively determined {{the fate of the}} Sheffield Shield, the Victorian all-rounder took 4/44 to help dismiss New South Wales for 149 and take a 292-run first innings lead. However, the defending champions hung on for a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> ensure the retention of their title. Loxton then surpassed his previous career best by taking 6/49 against Western Australia to set up a nine-wicket win in the last match of the season.|$|E
5|$|In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 {{record and}} a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game. Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight {{underperformance}} in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost position at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.|$|E

5|$|In the 1982–83 season, Akram Salman was {{appointed}} as the team's new manager. Al-Talaba started {{the season with}} confidence having won the league {{in the last two}} seasons, but finished in second place, only one point behind the league leaders, Salahaddin. Salahaddin were undefeated in the league while Al-Talaba had a single loss, by 2–0 loss to Al-Sinaa {{in the second round of}} matches. The championship was decided in the last match of the season when Al-Talaba met Salahaddin with only one point between them, so Salahaddin needed a win or a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> secure the title. Al-Talaba scored first and dominated the match until, in the last thirty minutes, Salahaddin managed to equalise. The score remained 1–1, which won Salahaddin the championship for the first time in their history. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, eight goals ahead of another Al-Talaba player, Rahim Hameed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 season, {{the team}} was relegated again to second division, winning the {{championship}} of that division the following year and promoted again to first division. The 2004–05 season saw the squad finish sixth. With its stadium closed for repairs, the team played at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium (except for two games at Makario Stadium). Nea Salamina returned to Ammochostos Stadium for the 2005–06 season, again finishing sixth. It finished 10th in the 2006–07 season and 13th in 2007–08, again relegated to the second division. After a difficult season in 2008–09, the team returned to first division, winning in the final game and leaving opponents Olympiacos, who only needed a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> win the promotion, in the second division.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg in Lyon, Barcelona fell behind to a seventh-minute free kick from Juninho, only for Thierry Henry to equalise halfway through the second half, giving Barcelona an away goal to take back to the Camp Nou. They needed a win or a no-score <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> {{guarantee}} passage, but a 4–1 half-time lead {{set the stage for}} a convincing 5–2 win. Two first-half goals from Henry and one each from Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o were followed by goals from Jean Makoun and Juninho either side of the interval to reduce Lyon's deficit. However, a goal from Seydou Keita in the fifthminute of injury time secured a 6–3 aggregate win and passage to the next round.|$|E

5|$|In the league, a 4–1 {{win against}} Leeds United in September meant the club broke {{the record for}} scoring in {{consecutive}} games (47), and away league games without defeat (22). The club began 2003 in first position, but subsequently floundered; a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> Aston Villa in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top. A further draw at Bolton Wanderers meant the league championship was, mathematically, out of Arsenal's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after ended their chances of retaining the league. Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup; a solitary goal scored by midfielder Robert Pirès was enough to beat Southampton in the 2003 final.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} leg of Juventus's clash with Milan in the Coppa Italia semi-finals, Del Piero {{finished}} off a brilliant move by Juventus as they secured a 2–2 <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> progress {{to the final}} with a 4–3 aggregate win. On 25 March, Del Piero helped Juventus defeat Inter by scoring the second goal of the match in a 2–0 victory, his first goal of the Serie A season. In Juventus' match against Lazio on 11 April, Del Piero replaced Vučinić in the second half, making his 700th appearance for Juventus, {{and then went on}} to score from a free kick to earn his side a 2–1 victory; the result also enabled Juventus to return {{to the top of the}} Serie A table.|$|E
5|$|Rankine {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Gateshead, managed by his former Alfreton and York manager Mills, on 30 June 2014 on a one-year contract.
