The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) will deliver many hundreds of SNIa detections, and well-sampled g'r'i'z' light curves, over the next 5 years. Using these data, we will obtain a precise measurement of the cosmological parameters (Omega_mass, Omega_Lambda); our goal is to determine the cosmological equation of state parameter w to a precision better than +- 0. 10, and hence test theories for the origin of the universal acceleration.

Photocopy. xii, 164 leaves, bound 29 cmThe term <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> cover s a {{broad range}} of {{techniques}} whose common aim is to quantify observed behavior in a <b>sample</b> of <b>time</b> during which the behavior is observed. Researchers using <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> aim to infer the true pattern of the behavior of interest from data on the observed pattern of behavior. Inaccuracy in data obtained from <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures was classified into two sources: (l) the observers and subjects, and (2) <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures themselves. This paper focused on the inaccuracy due to the procedures themselves. Inaccuracy due to <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures was classified into two sets of factors: (1) the pattern of true behavior, and (2) the design. decisions made by the researcher. Recent studies have suggested that accuracy of <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> is affected by the interaction of these two sets of factors. Since the researcher cannot manipulate the pattern of true behavior, this paper focused on the design decisions made by the researcher in an attempt to ascertain the relationship between design decisions and accuracy. The study employed a Monte Carlo approach, using a specially written computer program to generate 1000 "true" behaviors and then to simulate <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> studies based on these data under a wide range of values of <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> design factors. The simulated <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> data was analyzed by multiple linear regression techniques to ascertain factors related to accuracy of the data. For all three simulated <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures the regression analyses produced an R 2 value in excess of. 99. The results of the study show that accuracy of <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> is a linear function of certain design factors. Two conclusions were drawn from the findings of this study: (1) accuracy of <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures can be perfectly predicted from mean duration of behavior, length of time interval, and length of gap between intervals, and (2) most previous studies using <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures have produced inaccurate data. Three applications of the findings of the study to <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> studies were noted: (1) a formula was derived to enable values of design factors to be set such that the data collected is free from inaccuracy produced by <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures, (2) a formula was derived which {{can be used as a}} "correction factor" for data previously collected by <b>time</b> <b>sampling,</b> and (3) the usual method of using <b>time</b> <b>sampling</b> in settings where the true behavior pattern changes over the period of the study will result in data of differential accuracy over the period of the study, but this problem can be overcome by altering values of design variables over the period of the study...|$|R

Thirty-two critically ill patients with renal failure, treated with high-volume, continuous venovenous hemofiltration. High-volume, postdilutional continuous venovenous hemofiltration, with a standard blood flow rate of 200 mL/min and an ultrafiltrate volume of 100 L in 24 hrs, was performed with a highly permeable, large-surface cellulose triacetate membrane. Anticoagulation with anti-Xa bioequivalent doses of nadroparin and dalteparin was administered in the extracorporeal line before the filter. Blood was sampled for determination of coagulation variables before hemofiltration, 0. 5, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hrs after starting the treatment, {{and at the end}} of the hemofiltration run.

When analyzing the patients according to the length of <b>filter</b> survival <b>time,</b> no relationship among anti-Xa peak activity, area under the curve for 0 - 3 hrs, and <b>filter</b> survival <b>time</b> was found.
