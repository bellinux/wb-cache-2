5|$|Prior {{to being}} awarded the World championships in 2004, Liberec had hosted {{a total of}} 40 cross country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping {{competitions}} though it had not hosted a cross country World Cup event by June 2005. At a 24–25 May 2005 meeting, a report was given by the Liberec committee to the FIS race directors on course inspection, including layout of the courses. On 10 May 2006, a coordination <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> was held led by Roman Kumpošt, the first organizing committee chair, regarding venue construction, television production, and construction within Liberec itself {{in preparation for the}} championships. A coordination meeting took place in Liberec 18–19 April 2007 to discuss venue information and event preparation.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small <b>Group</b> <b>meeting,</b> the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E

25|$|This meeting {{proved so}} {{successful}} that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by George J. Hucker of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (part of Cornell University) in Geneva, New York, a small <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this. The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, {{the chairman of the}} session Fred C. Blanck of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the Institute of Food Technologists. This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, Roy C. Newton of Swift & Company in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer. By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members.|$|E

25|$|All 33 Labour councillors on Camden Borough Council {{voted on}} 7 March against setting a rate; they {{included}} Stephen Bevington {{who had only}} been elected a week before {{on a platform of}} setting no rate. The Conservative group on the council, who had supported setting the rate {{at the level of the}} cap, immediately called for surcharges on councillors where the delay in setting the rate led to financial losses for the council. At a Labour <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> on 26 March, Alan Woods moved a motion to declare that Camden would continue to refuse to set a rate even if other boroughs gave up; with council leader Phil Turner abstaining, the motion was lost by 15 votes to 14.|$|E

The residents of Discovery Bay think that it is time that this monopoly was reviewed.|$|E
25|$|To {{implement}} these strategies, Rolf led the union’s organizing staff into communities they hadn’t {{worked in}} before, and hired organizers that reflected those areas demographically. A neighborhood-based <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> structure {{was developed for}} home care workers to share stories, identify common challenges, and activate around the need for collective action. Rolf noted that through these meetings, home care workers “found {{out for the first}} time that they weren’t alone.” The local also worked closely with other groups, such as the disability community, around shared interests in a form of coalition-based social unionism. He raised the new local's credibility by taking a lead role on Proposition 210, a 1996 California State initiative that raised the minimum wage to $5.75 per hour beginning March 1, 1998. The local collected more signatures than any other group.|$|E

25|$|Veltroni, a {{professional}} journalist, was editor-in-chief of L'Unità, the newspaper of the Democratic Party of the Left from 1992-1996. He then successfully ran as vice-premier candidate, together with Romano Prodi, for the 1996 national election in Italy. In 1996, {{he joined the}} Bilderberg <b>Group</b> <b>meeting,</b> and was, from 1996-1998, Minister for Cultural Assets and Activities. In 1998, he resigned, subsequent to his election as National Secretary of the Democrats of the Left (DS). Despite his background as a journalist, he {{has been involved in}} controversial episodes related to freedom of expression. For example, in 2001, after the late night show Satyricon aired an interview that discussed indictments on links between the right-wing leader and the mafia, Marco Travaglio reported that Veltroni dispatched a messenger menacing the closure of the show.|$|E
25|$|Willow {{chooses to}} attend college with Buffy in Sunnydale {{although}} she is accepted to prestigious schools elsewhere. Her relationships with Buffy and Xander become strained {{as they try to}} find their place following high school. Willow becomes much more confident in college, finally finding a place that respects her intellect, while Buffy has difficulty in classes and Xander does not attend school. Willow's relationship with Oz continues until a female werewolf appears on the scene, aggressively pursuing him, and he leaves town to learn how to control the wolf within. She becomes depressed and explores magic more deeply, often with powerful but inconsistent results. She joins the campus Wicca <b>group,</b> <b>meeting</b> Tara Maclay, eventually falling in love with and choosing to be with her even when Oz returns to Sunnydale after apparently getting his lycanthropic tendencies under control.|$|E
25|$|As {{the time}} for voting on the budget approached, Livingstone {{discovered}} that instead of the outright illegality involved in resolving {{not to make a}} rate, the other councils were planning to exploit the legal grey area of refusing to make a rate for the time being. This strategy would put them in a different position to the GLC and ILEA who would be illegal immediately. Budget papers prepared by the Director-General Maurice Stonefrost then revealed that the capping limit still allowed the council to increase spending substantially; the papers were circulated to all members of the GLC on 1 March. A long and acrimonious debate at a Labour <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> on 4 March agreed by 24 votes to 18 to support the legal budget with its £25m in growth. The GLC Labour group split into three factions, with one group of 10 under John McDonnell insistent on not setting a rate, another of 8 under Ken Livingstone willing to defy the law but also to accept a budget at the cap if that stance failed, and a third group unwilling to support any illegal budgeting.|$|E

25|$|At 10:41, {{a second}} caller {{reported}} the incident, and {{was transferred to}} the State Police. At 10:55, Roberts was reaching the final stages of his plan. He had arranged the bound girls {{at the front of the}} classroom, near the chalkboard. Roberts made two cell phone calls, one to his wife and the next to police. He warned the 911 dispatcher that if state police were not off the property in two seconds, he would kill the children. The dispatcher attempted to delay him and put him in touch with the State Police, but Roberts ended the call. Two of the girls then began negotiating with Roberts. They pleaded for him to shoot them first. This allowed the girls a little extra time for possible rescue. At approximately 11:07a.m., Roberts followed through with his threats and the sound of rapid gunfire was heard. At 10:58, Mrs. Roberts called 911 after arriving home from a prayer study <b>group</b> <b>meeting.</b> She had discovered a suicide note left on the kitchen table and had received a brief and disturbing emotional phone call from her husband. The 911 dispatcher put her in touch with State Police.|$|E

Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark must leave to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, but he unexpectedly meets Joanne at the stage.

Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is clearly upset by Mimi's intrusion and he demands she leave him alone ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I?").|$|E

500|$|The {{design phase}} {{for the new}} twinjet was {{different}} from Boeing's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines – {{had a role in}} the development. This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input. The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the [...] "Working Together" [...] group. At the first <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines, asking what each wanted in the design. By March 1990, Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747's, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and 10percent better seat-mile costs than the A330 and MD-11. Boeing selected its Everett factory in Washington, home of 747 production, as the 777's final assembly site.|$|E
500|$|At a {{coordination}} <b>group</b> <b>meeting</b> on 18–19 April 2007 in Liberec, {{the event}} and facility preparations were discussed. A review was also done for what could have done better from the previous World Championships in Sapporo earlier that year. According to FIS Secretary General Lewis, she was pleased about the construction progress of both Ještěd (ski jumping) and Vesec (cross country skiing) and both venues were used as test events for the upcoming World Cup season. Organizing Committee chair Kumpošt stated that both venues would be completed by fall 2007 {{in order to ensure}} FIS certification. Also in attendance was the EBU and the organizing committee for the 2011 Championships in Oslo.

In ideal conditions, fourteen days of snow production were required to create the needed [...] of snow to ensure coverage of all competition courses at Vesec. Over 20 snow cannons were used in the snow-making process when temperatures dip below freezing according to Heczko.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: For Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) {{learning}} journal {{clubs are}} recommended, {{but these are}} not common practice. How participants discuss and learn about applying evidence in other <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> is unknown. We examined different types of <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> and explored the use of, and discussions about, clinical research evidence. METHODS: A mixed-methods study design was adopted. After distribution and analysis of a questionnaire about types of <b>group</b> <b>meetings,</b> interviews were conducted to better understand the most frequently occurring type. RESULTS: GPs have different types of meetings, but the most common <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> where evidence wass discussed were so called quality circles, i. e. pharmacotherapy audit meetings in which GPs discuss drug prescription figures or preferred treatment together with pharmacists. Interviews showed that the source of evidence used mostly are the recommendations in the national GP guidelines. The underlying evidence or new research did not {{play an important role in}} the discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Quality circles seem to be more goal-oriented than learning oriented. Learning discussions about controversies in clinical research or about the integration of evidence, patient values and clinical expertise occurred infrequently. To harvest the potential value of <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> for EBM learning, quality circles in their present design are not optimal...|$|R
