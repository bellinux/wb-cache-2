5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> response.|$|E

5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> library.

5|$|Leading all Tech {{receivers}} was Josh Morgan, {{who caught}} eight passes for 55yards and a touchdown. Eddie Royal also <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> {{game for the}} Hokies, catching twolong passes of 18yards and 11yards on subsequent plays in the second quarter. Royal's 2catches drove the Hokies deep into Boston College territory, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman that tied the game at halftime. Royal's biggest play, however, came halfway through the fourth quarter when he caught the go-ahead touchdown pass from Sean Glennon. The 24-yard reception was Royal's longest catch of the day, and the touchdown gave the Hokies a lead they would not relinquish {{for the rest of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Martins opened {{extra time}} with a shot on goal while the Sounders played {{increasingly}} higher on the field. Seattle {{took the lead in}} the 101st minute when Dempsey and Martins connected on a play that resulted in Dempsey making a low shot. Martins, Dempsey, and Pappa effectively countered Philadelphia's attacks {{in the second half of}} extra time and Pappa hit the crossbar on an attempted shot. Valdes <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> opportunity to tie the match in the 111th minute when he made a header towards the Sounders goal, but the shot was weak and easily saved. Although Philadelphia was pressing the attack, Martins scored in the 114th minute to put the Sounders up 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in {{her only}} start, she <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> pedigree. Her sire Princequillo {{was the leading}} broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted {{as a source of}} stamina and soundness. Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was {{purchased}} by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced Sir Gaylord, a stakes winner who became an important sire, whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor. Somethingroyal's other stakes winners were First Family, Sir Gaylord and Syrian Sea.|$|E

5|$|That year, William Stearn {{succeeded in}} obtaining a {{scholarship}} to the local Cambridge High School for Boys on Hills Road, close to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, which he attended for eight years till he was eighteen. The school <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> reputation for biology education, {{and while he was}} there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised his talents. The school also provided him with a thorough education in both Latin and Greek. He became secretary of the school Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden. Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army {{could muster}} 22 divisions, which {{contained}} 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> 47mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. One report states that a round from a 47mm gun went straight through a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns {{were better than}} the 25mm and 37mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The team <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> later half of {{the season}} in single-day races, {{attaining}} top-ten placings in all but one such race that they entered. This successful run started at the Clásica de San Sebastián. Both Schleck brothers were mentioned as possible pre-race contenders, and Fränk Schleck rode to sixth place on the day by finishing with the first chase pack back of solo winner Philippe Gilbert and second-placed Carlos Barredo. In August, Nizzolo continued his strong neo-pro season with a fifth place ride at the GP Ouest-France, finishing second-best from the peloton behind three attacking riders who took each podium place just ahead of them.|$|E

5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced {{by the fact that}} he <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Gunn ascribes {{much of his}} goalkeeping {{success to}} the support of Belgian Marc De Clerck, a {{specialist}} goalkeeping coach at Aberdeen. At a time when few British teams provided such training, De Clerck introduced Gunn and Scottish international keeper Jim Leighton to what were then innovative training techniques. The goalkeepers would participate in special drills whilst training {{with the rest of}} the squad. Gunn also notes the influence of Aberdeen coach Teddy Scott, who taught the value of hard work and dedication; Gunn also served as a boot boy for Alex McLeish. Leighton's presence meant that Gunn played only 21 games for Aberdeen. He made his debut against Hibernian at Pittodrie on 30 October 1982, and went on to keep four clean sheets for the club. Despite being rivals for a first-team place, Gunn <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> relationship with Leighton that included joining Leighton's family for a meal once a week.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1979–80, under former {{player and}} new manager Billy McNeill, {{they reached the}} quarter-finals of the European Cup. Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2–0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> match, and in {{particular}} his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle missed an excellent chance to score early in the first half, and then just before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real. Uli Stielike levelled the tie {{in the second half}} with a powerful volley past Latchford, before Juanito added a third near the end to send Celtic out 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the game, the Welsh manager Mike England was unhappy {{that the game}} was to be played at Ninian Park in Cardiff instead of the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. Wales at the time <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> record at the Racecourse, both in {{qualifying}} tournaments for the World Cup and European Championships, and in the British Home Championship. During the early 1970s, Wrexham had embarked on making significant improvements to the Racecourse, with two new stands built and a new roof installed over the Kop End. Ninian Park however had had its capacity cut {{as a result of}} various safety inspections until improvements were made. The smaller capacity of the Racecourse additionally meant that home games were more likely to sell out. This had led to the FAW choosing the Racecourse {{for the majority of the}} national team's home games from 1977 onwards. Before the game against Scotland, Wales had played twenty home games since the beginning of 1980, with eight each of those played at Cardiff and Wrexham. Of those, Wales had won 6 and drawn 2, including two wins against England, and the 3–0 victory over Spain earlier in the qualifying tournament at the Racecourse, while they had won 3, drawn 2 and lost 3 at Ninian Park. However, in spite of Wales' exceptional record at the Racecourse, the interest in the game led to the FAW to name the larger Ninian Park as the venue.|$|E
