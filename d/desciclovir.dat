40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is {{responsible}} for a primary infection (varicella) followed by a latency, eventually resulting in herpes zoster (shingles). The replication cycle of VZV is normally interrupted after varicella. Consequently, VZV remains dormant in the organism. Reactivation occurs after viraemia, {{and the development of}} tissue alterations (skin and viscera) depends on the immunological status of the patient. Diagnosis of herpes zoster relies on clinical recognition and cytological and histological evaluations combined with immunohistochemistry and molecular biology techniques. Treatment of herpes zoster primarily relies upon antiviral drugs and incidentally on immunomodulating agents, specific immunoglobulins, antimicrobial agents, antiviral enzymes and corticosteroids. Drugs with a clinically relevant activity against varicella zoster virus infections include aciclovir, adenosine monophosphate, bromodeoxyuridine, <b>desciclovir,</b> fiacitabine, idoxuridine, interferon-alpha and vidarabine. Among them, aciclovir appears to be a first-line agent. Its efficacy has been well established by many clinical studies. Promising drugs for the future include famciclovir, penciclovir, valaciclovir and other molecules currently under investigation. Recent and promising improvements in antiviral drug development may increase patient compliance, cost-benefit ratios and therapeutic efficacy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Agents {{available}} to treat herpesvirus infections include idoxuridine, trifluridine, vidarabine and acyclovir for the topical treatment of herpetic eye infections; vidarabine and acyclovir for the systemic (intravenous) treatment of herpes encephalitis; acyclovir for the topical and systemic (oral) treatment of genital herpes; acyclovir for the systemic (intravenous, oral) treatment of HSV or varicella-zoster (VZV) infections in immunosuppressed patients; brivudin for the systemic (oral) treatment of HSV- 1 or VZV infections in immunosuppressed patients; and ganciclovir and foscarnet for the systemic (intravenous) treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Brivudin is also {{effective in the}} treatment of herpetic eye infections that no longer respond to idoxuridine, trifluridine, vidarabine or acyclovir; and foscarnet is effective {{in the treatment of}} infections with acyclovir-resistant, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV or VZV mutants. Other antiviral agents considered for use in herpesvirus infections include brovavir, penciclovir (and its prodrug famciclovir), <b>desciclovir</b> (a prodrug of acyclovir), bishydroxymethylcyclobutylguanine (BHCG) and, in particular, 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine (HPMPC). The latter is more active than either acyclovir or ganciclovir in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of various HSV- 1, HSV- 2, TK- HSV, VZV or CMV infections in animal models. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{incomplete}} {{absorption of}} acyclovir (ACV) when given orally in humans, {{efforts have been}} made to develop a prodrug of ACV that would be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and then converted in vivo to ACV. One such compound, <b>desciclovir</b> (DCV), is converted to acyclovir in vivo by xanthine oxidase. We gave each of 13 healthy volunteers 250 mg (about 3. 25 mg/kg of body weight) of DCV orally thrice daily for 10 days, collected serial plasma and urine specimens, and measured DCV and ACV concentrations. The absorption of DCV was at least 75 %, and almost two-thirds of the administered oral dose was recovered in the urine as ACV. Peak ACV levels in plasma were about 5 micrograms/ml and were reached in less than 1 h. The levels of ACV achieved in plasma were of the same magnitude as those reported for subjects given intravenous ACV at a dose of 2. 5 mg/kg and approximately 10 -fold higher than levels attained after administration of 200 mg of oral ACV every 4 h as measured in previous studies. The half-life of DCV was 0. 85 +/- 0. 16 h, compared with 2. 6 +/- 0. 5 h for ACV, indicating rapid conversion of DCV to ACV. There was no substantial increase in ACV levels in plasma on day 11 compared with day 2. No serious or consistent adverse effects were noted. In particular, the creatinine level in serum did not significantly rise in any subject and remained within the normal range in all...|$|E
