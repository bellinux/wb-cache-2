5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{bright orange}} bill plates and other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E
500|$|In general, juveniles have {{feathers}} {{which are}} narrower and more sharply {{pointed at the}} tip. This can be particularly visible when the bird is in flight, {{especially in the case}} of raptors. The trailing edge of the wing of a <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> can appear almost serrated, due to the feathers' sharp tips, while that of an older bird will be straighter-edged. [...] The flight feathers of a <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> will also be uniform in length, since they all grew at the same time. Those of adults will be of various lengths and levels of wear, since each is moulted at a different time.|$|E

500|$|Prey can {{be spotted}} from a distance; European bee-eaters {{are able to}} spot a bee [...] away, and blue-cheeked bee-eaters have been {{observed}} flying out [...] to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands {{on the ground or}} on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird's eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the venom sac and stinger. This behaviour is innate, as demonstrated by a <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.|$|E
500|$|Breeding is cooperative. During the nest-building {{phase of}} the {{breeding}} season, grey jay breeding pairs are accompanied by a third, <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird.</b> A 1991 field study in Quebec and Ontario found that approximately 65% of grey jay trios included a dominant juvenile from the pair's previous breeding season, and approximately 30% of trios included non-dominant juveniles who had left their parents' territory. Occasionally, two nonbreeding juveniles accompany a pair of adults. The role of juveniles is in allofeeding (food sharing) by retrieving caches and bringing food to younger siblings; however, this is only allowed by the parents during the post-fledgling period. Until then, parents will drive the other birds away from the nest. This may reduce the frequency of predator-attracting visits to the nest when young are most vulnerable. The benefits of juveniles participating in subsequent brood care may include [...] "lightening the load" [...] for the breeding pair, which may possibly increase longevity, reducing the probability of starvation of nestlings, and detecting and mobbing predators near the nest. Dominant juveniles may eventually inherit the natal territory and breed, while unrelated juveniles may eventually fill a vacancy nearby or form a new breeding pair on previously unoccupied ground.|$|E
500|$|The brown honeyeater is a medium-small, plain grey-brown honeyeater with a {{body length}} of , a {{wingspan}} of , and an average weight of [...] The female is slightly smaller than the male, but the sexes differ only slightly in appearance. The head, back, rump, and upper tail-coverts are brown, and the wings a darker brown. The only distinguishing features are a small yellow patch behind the eye, which is indistinct in some birds, and dull yellow-olive panels in the folded wings and tail. The brown honeyeater’s sexual dimorphism is slight. The adult male has a dark brownish-grey forehead and crown, contrasting with a brownish nape. The forehead and crown of the adult female is a similar olive-brown {{to the rest of}} the upper body. A <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> is similar to the female, but may lack or show only a trace of the yellow tuft behind the eye. The bill is black, and is long, slender and curved slightly downwards, well adapted for probing deep tubular flowers. The gape in the male is black when breeding, and pale yellow at other times. The gape of the female is always pale yellow, and in the juvenile bright yellow and swollen. The iris is brown, and the feet and legs grey-black.|$|E
50|$|<b>Juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> are pale rufous {{to white}} below with sparse {{streaking}} {{on the upper}} breast.|$|R
50|$|<b>Juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> do {{not have}} the white patches {{on either side of the}} neck. When they are about six months old (about three months out of the nest) they gain small white patches on both sides of the neck, which {{gradually}} enlarge until they are fully formed when the bird is about 6-8 months old (approx. ages only). <b>Juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> also have a greyer beak and an overall lighter grey appearance than adult birds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> can be {{distinguished}} from common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) by its obviously paler plumage and short yellow bill. Young birds moult into a subdued version of the adult plumage in autumn, yet these lack the crest. They do not acquire their adult plumage until they are nearly one year old in females, and nearly two years in males. The latter grow plumage very similar to adult females in their second year, but are distinguished by longer crests and noticeably pale feather edges than female <b>juvenile</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Song {{learning}} in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile {{listening to the}} father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the <b>juvenile</b> <b>bird</b> producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template. During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called [...] "sub-song", which is akin to babbling in human infants. Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called [...] "plastic song". Finally, {{after two or three}} months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order). Some birds, such as zebra finches, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.|$|E

40|$|Data on the {{dispersal}} {{and recruitment}} of <b>juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> following fledging are largely unreported for Australian birds. In this study, we investigated the short-distance dispersal {{of a sample}} of colour-banded, juvenile Red-capped Robins, Petroica goodenovii, in Terrick Terrick National Park, Victoria, Australia. Of 67 colour-banded <b>juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> that successfully reached independence during the 2000 – 01 breeding season, eight were recruited into the study area or adjacent areas for the following breeding season. A ninth bird was resighted in Gunbower State Forest, 36 km from where it was banded. This is the furthest recorded dispersal movement of a Red-capped Robin. Of 59 colour-banded <b>juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> that reached independence during the 2001 – 02 season, four remained within the study area {{for the remainder of}} the breeding season, but these birds were not present in the study area during the following breeding season. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>birds</b> that successfully reached independence and dispersed were heavier as nestlings, when controlled for age and date, than birds that disappeared (assumed dead) before reaching independence. Estimates of Red-capped Robin abundances within Terrick Terrick National Park were greater than those of nearby eucalypt woodlands, suggesting that the White Cypress-pine, Callitris glaucophylla, woodlands within the park offer good-quality habitat for Red-capped Robins and may be saturated with breeding territories. Thus, juveniles may be forced to establish breeding territories far from their natal territories. These results are discussed in relation to avenues for further research on juvenile dispersal in Australian birds and their conservation implications. <br /...|$|R
