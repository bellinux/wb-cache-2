Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.|$|E

Instead of exchanging static or <b>fixed</b> <b>attributes</b> about users, participants in the ecosystem will be able to obtain better insight through a collective sharing of algorithms, governed through a trust network. Algorithms for specific data-sets must be vetted to be privacy-preserving, fair and free from bias. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 31 reference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Sell-through is {{a widely}} used {{performance}} metric in retail supply chains, but limited empirical research exists about its validity for that purpose, given its dependence on many different variables. This study analyses to what extent sell-through is influenced by <b>fixed</b> store <b>attributes</b> (e. g. store size), and what impact on this metric operational management decisions (e. g. replenishment) have. Using data collected from a fashion retailer, a sales model was developed to estimate the statistical contribution of {{the different types of}} impacts to sell-through. Results of the study provided strong empirical evidence that <b>fixed</b> store <b>attributes</b> such as store size can impact significantly sell-through levels. Operational management decisions also have a statistically significant impact on sell-through, but to a much smaller extent. This makes sell-through more valuable for compare performance when <b>fixed</b> store <b>attributes</b> are not differential...|$|R

50|$|The social {{intelligence}} quotient (SQ) is a statistical abstraction, {{similar to the}} ‘standard score’ approach used in IQ tests, {{with a mean of}} 100. Scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high. Unlike the standard IQ test, it is not a fixed model. It leans more to Jean Piaget’s theory that intelligence is not a <b>fixed</b> <b>attribute</b> but a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment. Therefore, an individual can change their SQ by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment.|$|E
50|$|Linguistic {{insecurity}} {{refers to}} feelings of anxiety, self-consciousness, or {{lack of confidence in}} the mind of a speaker surrounding the use of their own language. Often, this anxiety comes from speakers' belief that their use of language does not conform to the perceived standard and/or the style of language expected by the speakers' interlocutor(s). Linguistic insecurity is situationally induced and is often a matter of the feeling of inadequacy regarding personal performance in certain contexts, rather than a <b>fixed</b> <b>attribute</b> of an individual. This insecurity can lead to stylistic, and phonetic shifts away from an affected speaker's default speech variety; these shifts may be performed consciously {{on the part of the}} speaker, or may be reflective of an unconscious effort to conform to a more prestigious or context-appropriate style of speech. Linguistic insecurity is linked to the perception of speech styles in any community, and so may vary based on socioeconomic class and gender. It is also especially pertinent in multilingual societies.|$|E

In this work, we try to extend this notion to a hierarchy of attribute sets with different levels of quality.

We propose an approach for selecting those interesting objects and demonstrate its superior performance to random selection. ...|$|E

Astrolabe provides scalable data collection and attribute based lookup but has limited capacity for performing analysis. Astrolabe partitions groups of hosts into an overlapping hierarchy of zones {{in a manner similar}} to DNS. Astrolabe zones have a recursive definition: a zone is either a host or a set of non overlapping zones. Two zones are non-overlapping if they have no hosts in common. The smallest zones consist of single hosts which are grouped into increasingly large zones. The top level zone includes all other zones and hosts within those zones.

Due to the lack of necessary guidance mechanisms as well as relative <b>fixed</b> <b>attribute</b> weights of judgement factors, the traditional tourism management model can hardly manage the highly dynamic crowd effectively. In this paper, an optimized tourism management model of large optimal node-driven is put forward. Through extracting the relevant data of tourism passenger source, calculating the availability of tourism resources as well as performing the driven scheduling according to the status of tourism resource nodes everywhere, the tourism resources can be managed effectively with assurance. Experimental results show that through the use of the proposed model, the effect of management for tourism passenger source can be optimized significantly while the efficiency of the management can also be guaranteed.

Thus things are active not because they are imbued with agency but because of ways in wich they are caught up in these currents of the lifeworld.

We describe a system employing Scatter/Gather and demonstrate that users are able to use this system close to its full potential. 1 Introduction An important service offered by an information access system is the organization of retrieval results.

The main goal {{of this paper is to}} develop the equilibrium properties of a broadly applicable and readily estimable class of sorting models that allow the location decision to depend on both <b>fixed</b> local <b>attributes</b> (including unobserved attributes) and such local interactions. In particular, we prove uniqueness in the case of congestion effects and use a series of simulations to demonstrate that a unique equilibrium is more likely to obtain (i) the smaller are any agglomeration effects, (ii) the larger are the set of choices available to the agents, (iii) the more "meaningful variation" there is in those choices, and (iv) the more heterogeneous are the agents themselves. This is encouraging for the use of our model to describe the sorting of individuals and firms over geographic space, where the number of choices is usually large and variation in exogenous <b>fixed</b> <b>attributes</b> can be important. Moreover, these results conveniently coincide with the conditions required for conometric identification of our model.

It is clear that SLA research is ambivalent toward {{the function of the}} ZPD construed by the professionals of the field decades ago.

However, these studies failed to indicate how they could identify the rates and routes of learning and development relevant to the ZPD (Mitchell and Myles 1998). In addition, we must no longer view the ZPD as a <b>fixed</b> <b>attribute</b> of an individual, but rather as an unpredictable nexus of people and tools in an activity to jointly create conditions for language development (Wells, 1999).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Self-perceived uselessness is {{associated}} with poor health and high mortality among older adults in China. However, it is unclear which demographic, psychosocial, behavioral and health factors are associated with self-perceived uselessness. Methods Data came from four waves (2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014) of the largest nationwide longitudinal survey of the population aged 65 and older in China (26, 624 individuals contributed 48, 476 observations). This study aimed to systematically investigate factors associated with self-perceived uselessness based on the proposed REHAB framework that includes resources (R), environments (E), health (H), <b>fixed</b> <b>attributes</b> (A) and behaviors (B). Self-perceived uselessness was measured by a single item: 2 ̆ 01 cwith age, do you feel more useless? 2 ̆ 01 d and coded by frequency: high (always and often), moderate (sometimes) and low (seldom and never). Multinomial logistic regression models with low frequency as the reference category were employed to identify REHAB risk factors associated with self-perceived uselessness. Results Most factors in the REHAB framework were associated with self-perceived uselessness, although some social environmental factors in the full model were not significant. Specifically, more socioeconomic resources were associated with reduced relative risk ratio (RRR) of high or moderate frequency of self-perceived uselessness relative to low frequency. More environmental family/social support was associated with lower RRR of high frequency of self-perceived uselessness. Cultural factors such as coresidence with children and intergenerational transfer were associated with reduced RRR of high frequency of self-perceived uselessness. Indicators of poor health status such as disability and loneliness were associated with greater RRR of high or moderate frequency of self-perceived uselessness. <b>Fixed</b> <b>attributes</b> of older age and Han ethnicity were associated with increased RRR of high frequency of self-perceived uselessness; whereas optimism and self-control were associated with reduced RRR. Behaviors including regular consumption of alcohol, regular exercise, social participation and leisure activities were associated with reduced RRR of high frequency of self-perceived uselessness. Conclusions Self-perceived uselessness {{was associated with a}} wide range of factors in the REHAB framework. The findings could have important implications for China to develop and target community health programs to improve self-perceived usefulness among older adults...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of a large and unique longitudinal data set demonstrates that late childbearing after age 35 or 40 is significantly associated with survival and healthy survival among very old Chinese women and men. The association is stronger in oldest-old women than men. The estimates are adjusted {{for a variety of}} confounding factors of demographic characteristics, family support, social connections, health practices, and health conditions. Further analysis based on an extension of the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Attribute</b> Dynamics method shows that late childbearing is positively associated with long-term survival and healthy survival from ages 80 - 85 to 90 - 95 and 100 - 105. This association exists among oldest-old women and men, but, again, the effects are substantially stronger in women than men. We discuss four possible factors which may explain why late childbearing affects healthy longevity at advanced ages: (1) social factors; (2) biological changes caused by late pregnancy and delivery; (3) genetic and other biological characteristics; and (4) selection. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} analytical framework, {{one that}} sees {{class as a}} process over time and not a <b>fixed</b> <b>attribute,</b> is proposed {{as a means to}} redirect class analysis and revive a theoretical debate that has gone stale. Class analysis implies an inherently dynamic perspective. However, quantitative studies of class that go beyond static analyses of cross-sections are rare. Three dimensions of class may be identified in previous work on the effects of class: 1) class as market situation, 2) class as social status, and 3) class as position in the relations of production. A longitudinal multi-dimensional model would allow each of these aspects of class to independently influence the life course over time. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) techniques are used to estimate a model of this type. Thirteen years of individual income data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) are used to illustrate the application of this framework. The estimate results indicate that each of the three dimensions significantly affects income trajectories over time, but they do so in different ways. ...|$|E
