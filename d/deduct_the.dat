5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E
5|$|Druitt's {{father died}} {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.|$|E
5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E

25|$|Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent {{personal}} income tax, {{depending upon the}} amount earned and filing status.

Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (Social Security and Medicare tax).|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} {{creditors}} resident in Switzerland, the withholding tax {{is only a}} means of securing the payment of the income or profit tax, from which the creditor may then <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> amount already withheld, or request its refund. The same applies to foreign creditors {{to the extent that}} a tax treaty provides for it. Other foreign creditors are not eligible for a refund; with respect to them, the withholding tax is a genuine tax.|$|E

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home mortgage interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E
25|$|The Land Transport Authority (LTA) in Singapore {{implemented}} an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) {{scheme to}} deter traffic congestion during peak hours at various roads. The ERP scheme requires electronic gantries {{to be placed}} over the road at designated locations and that cars be equipped with an In-Vehicle Unit (IU), a rectangular device pasted on the inside bottom right of the front windscreen from the driver's view, which will <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> toll price from a CashCard. The CashCard must be inserted into the device, and {{failure to do so}} is in violation of law. There is no charge for entering the area during certain non-peak times.|$|E
25|$|All Metrobuses have SmarTrip card readers which {{automatically}} <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> correct fare from a rider's SmarTrip card (including transfer credit). Formerly, Metrobus issued paper transfers {{which gave}} the rider free transfers to any regular bus for two hours. Effective January 4, 2009, when a rider uses a SmarTrip card, they will automatically receive rail-to-bus transfer credit and bus-to-bus free transfer time for regular buses is increased to three hours. Express routes have different requirements. This section discusses the transfer policy to and from Metrobus and other regional bus operators. The routes can be Metrobus routes or routes of other regional operators. Note that as of January 4, 2009, transfer credit is issued exclusively on a SmarTrip card; riders using cash payment cannot obtain a paper transfer and must pay full fare upon boarding the bus. On June 27, 2010, the transfer window was reduced from 3 hours to 2 hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{incomes of}} the poorest {{sections}} of society were increased exponentially {{as a result of}} social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage. Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> cost of child care for all {{children under the age of}} three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.|$|E
500|$|Further, {{under the}} U.S. federal tax laws, even if labor were {{considered}} [...] "property" [...] the gain or income from [...] "labor property" [...] would {{be defined as}} the excess of the amount realized (for example, the money received) by the taxpayer over the amount of the taxpayer's [...] "adjusted basis" [...] in the [...] "property" [...] (see [...] ). Since the taxpayer can have only a zero [...] "basis" [...] amount {{in his or her own}} labor [...] the personal living expenses incurred to generate labor being both non-capitalizable and, under , non-deductible [...] the [...] "gain" [...] would thus be equal to the amount of compensation received by the taxpayer. Compare Carter v. Commissioner, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated: [...] "The assertion that proceeds received for personal services cannot be given a 'zero-basis for the purpose of the assessment of taxation,' is frivolous. This is a variation of the 'wages are not income' theme, which has been rejected repeatedly by this court." [...] See also Reading v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that gain from labor of self-employed individual cannot be determined until the [...] "cost of doing labor" [...] has been subtracted from the amount received [...] was rejected; validity of , disallowing deductions for personal living expenses, was upheld). See also Burnett v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that wages represent an equal exchange of property and, therefore, are not taxable income [...] was rejected). See also In re Myrland (ruling that a taxpayer is not entitled to <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> value of his labor from his income in calculating his taxes).|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} between Woods and Rand {{allowed him to}} hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author's royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand's 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him [...] "a very ratty Broadway hanger-on". As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand's refusal to make some of them. He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn, {{the author of the}} previous hit Five Star Final, to act as a script doctor. Rand's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand's royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, [...] "That was [...] he did?" [...] In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed-upon one percent, but that Woods could not <b>deduct</b> <b>the</b> payment from Rand's royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's Ambassador Theatre on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.|$|E
