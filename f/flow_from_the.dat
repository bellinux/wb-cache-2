5|$|A further {{improvement}} {{was made in}} 1951 when a concrete-lined channel was constructed to divert stream <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby Kangaroo Gully catchment. The Canning Dam and reservoir was Perth's primary source of water until the boom growth {{of the city in}} the 1960s and the completion of Serpentine Dam in 1961.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
5|$|Isidore caused {{heavy rains}} in Guatemala due to upslope <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean, {{which led to}} {{landslides}} and flooding across southern and western portions of the country. The rains led to the drowning of two people {{when they tried to}} cross a rain-swollen river. Three hundred and fifty households reported losses.|$|E

5|$|The tor {{and other}} sites in Glastonbury {{have also been}} {{significant}} in Goddess worship, with the <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chalice Well representing menstrual flow and the tor being seen as either a breast or the whole figure of the Goddess. This has been celebrated with an effigy of the Goddess leading an annual procession up the Tor.|$|E
5|$|The {{winds are}} {{predominantly}} northern. Along the coastline the winds <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north in November – March, {{from the east}} in April – August and from the north-east in September – October. The sea breeze causes the high frequency of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the June 27 <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ongoing {{eruption}} {{threatened to}} enter the town of Pahoa, and to cut Highway 130, the only route {{into and out of}} Lower Puna. As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes. However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015, the threat to the town was much reduced.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} the rivers that <b>flow</b> inland <b>from</b> Australia's Great Dividing Range form distributaries, most of which flow only {{intermittently}} during times of high river levels and end in shallow lakes or simply peter out in the deserts. Yarriambiack Creek, which <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wimmera River into Lake Coorong, and Tyrrell Creek, which <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Avoca River into Lake Tyrrell, are two distributaries in Victoria. <b>The</b> Narran River <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Balonne River in Queensland into Narran Lake in New South Wales.|$|R
5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, {{as evidence of the}} eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E

The rate of <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|The Huon Peninsula is {{situated}} along the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, and stretches from Lae {{in the south}} on the Huon Gulf to Sio in the north along the Vitiaz Strait. Along the coast, between these two points, numerous rivers and streams cut the terrain. Of these, the most prominent are the Song, Bumi and Mape Rivers. These waterways <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountainous interior which is formed through the conglomeration of the Rawlinson Range in the south, with the Cromwell Mountains in the east. These meet in {{the centre of the}} peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif, which joins the Finisterre Range further west. Apart from a thin, flat coastal strip, {{at the time of the}} campaign, the area was thickly covered with dense jungle, through which very few tracks had been cut. The terrain was rugged and for the most part the tracks, until improved by engineers, were largely impassable to motor transport and as a result throughout the campaign a large amount of the Allied resupply effort was undertaken on foot.|$|E
