40|$|The {{history of}} mine {{backfill}} {{shows that in}} the past, considerable improvements in backfill-reliant mining technology were made when new <b>fill</b> <b>systems</b> were introduced. The present trend in mine backfill technology is towards the use of high-density <b>fill</b> <b>systems.</b> Tight <b>filling</b> and void reduction have also become essential requirements in engineering design of mines to ensure global stability. High-density fills have a low moisture content and are more competent products requiring less binder and time for stabilization, compared to conventional hydraulic backfill. Cemented rockfill and tailings/sand paste fills are two familiar high-density backfill systems in current use. In future {{there could be a}} high demand for low porosity high-density fills, as mines go deeper and ground stresses increase. This study was an original attempt to investigate the characteristics and property of high-density composite <b>fill</b> <b>systems.</b> Composite <b>fills</b> are made up of derivatives of waste rock, tailings, sand and metallurgical by-products. Composite fills represent the future direction of backfill technology. As mines go deeper, the ore could be processed underground and the waste rock and tailings combined together to form a low-porosity competent fill product. The application of composite <b>fill</b> <b>systems</b> will also increase the material available for backfilling, provide more flexibility in backfill mix design and produce competent <b>fill</b> <b>systems</b> for ground support. It will also benefit the underground mine environment through effective utilization of mine wastes. The fundamental basis of the work required the study and understanding of the characteristics and properties of cemented rockfill and paste backfill. The effects of sand addition to fine tailings as a means of reducing porosity and improving the mechanical properties of the fill product were also investigated. Additionally, a new concept of backfill, namely, Composite-Aggregate Paste (CAP) that consists of a mixture of fine tailings and graded coarse aggregates was introduced and the material properties were investigated...|$|R

50|$|A {{capillary}} <b>filling</b> <b>system</b> {{was introduced}} by Parker in the Parker 61 in 1956. There were no moving parts: the ink reservoir within the barrel was open at the upper end, but contained a tightly rolled length of slotted, flexible plastic. To fill, the barrel was unscrewed, the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated capillary action, drawing up and retaining the ink. The outside of the reservoir was coated with Teflon, a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn. Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib. No method of flushing the device was offered, and because of problems from clogging with dried and hardened ink, production was eventually stopped.|$|E
