25|$|After {{hearing all}} the evidence, {{it was decided}} that the weather had caused a freeze–thaw action which had led to {{settlement}} in the ground. Another contributory factor was the construction work being carried out during poor weather, and then not being checked for settlement when the weather had improved. The settlement was sufficient to twist the tracks and reduce the contact between the rack (on the track) and the pinion (on the locomotive).

25|$|At a {{convention}} in Tejeros, Cavite, the revolutionaries assembled {{to form a}} revolutionary government. There, Bonifacio lost his bid for {{the presidency of the}} revolutionary government to Emilio Aguinaldo, who was in Pasong Santol, fighting the Spanish forces and instead was elected Secretary of the Interior. When members of the Magdalo faction tried to discredit him as uneducated and unfit for the position, Bonifacio declared the results of the convention as null and void, speaking as the Supremo of the Katipunan. Despite this, Aguinaldo took his oath of office as president the next day in Santa Cruz de Malabon (present-day Tanza) in Cavite, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the officers, except for Bonifacio. Andrés Bonifacio and his brother Procopio were later arrested due to alleged incidents in Indang and, upon the orders of the Council of War and approved by Gen. Aguinaldo, they were both executed on May 10, 1897, at Mount Buntis in Maragondon, Cavite. He and his brother were buried in an unmarked grave.|$|E

Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out. When Churchill finally came to the Ministry's offices, he was met with what he termed [...] "the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life".

500|$|The film marked Robin Williams' first {{animation}} role, {{with the}} character Batty Koda being created specifically for him.

Director Bill Kroyer was so impressed with the voice work he ended up tripling the screen time given to the character. Williams went on to provide the critically applauded voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin later the same year. Williams accepted the role in FernGully because he agreed with the film's message, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the voice cast, who all worked for scale wages.

500|$|According to {{survivor}} accounts, {{before dawn}} on August 15 the H Company mortar platoon {{became aware of}} enemy activity near Hill 303. The platoon leader telephoned G Company, 5th Cavalry, which informed him a platoon of 60 South Korean troops would come to reinforce the mortar platoon. Later {{in the morning the}} platoon saw two North Korean T-34s followed by 200 or more enemy soldiers on the road below them. A little later a group of Koreans appeared on the slope. A patrol going to meet the climbing Korean troops called out and received in reply a blast of gunfire from automatic weapons. The mortar platoon leader, Lt. Jack Hudspeth, believed they were friendly. Some of the Americans realized that the advancing troops were North Korean and were going to open up on them according to former Pvt. Fred Ryan and Pvt. Roy Manring, when they revisited the old mortar position in 1999. Hudspeth ordered them not to fire and threatened them with a court-martial if they <b>did.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> of the watching Americans were not convinced that the new arrivals were enemy soldiers until the red stars became visible on their field caps. By that time, they were extremely close to the American positions. The North Korean troops came right up to the foxholes without either side firing a shot. Hudspeth ordered his platoon to surrender without a fight as it was far outnumbered and outgunned. The North Koreans quickly took [...] the mortarmen captive. Estimates of the number captured range from 31 to 42.|$|E

Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her.
