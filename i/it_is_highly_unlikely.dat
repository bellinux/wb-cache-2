5|$|Thomas F. Wilson, {{known for}} playing the {{character}} Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter. In the comic books, Stan Carter was a vicious serial killer {{by the name of}} Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> the series will make him the murdering alter-ego.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E

50|$|With {{the death}} of King Fahd in August 2005, some felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still {{possible}} that Yamani {{would return to the}} Saudi Government under King Abdullah, most likely as an ambassador, but sources close to Yamani indicated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that dogs {{would have been}} eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs {{in the ancient world}} have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that single-story {{structures}} such as {{mobile homes}} can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, {{if it turns out}} upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E
25|$|During the Syrian Occupation of Lebanon (1976–2005), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Lebanon {{would sign}} {{a peace treaty}} with Israel before Syria, as Syria's {{influence}} on Lebanese politics was strong; however, the Syrian Occupation withdrew from Lebanon, yet the Iran–Syria–Hezbollah axis remained through the heavy arms presence.|$|R
50|$|Observing the {{structure}} of the skull, its characteristics were nearly identical to that of the indigenous people of the region.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that {{a chassis}} {{would leave the}} works with the same body, engine or gearbox that it entered with.

5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are so {{different}} from Efe's that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins {{can be used to}} demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that this {{occurred during the}} apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, {{as has been the}} case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
50|$|On 18 July 2006, Gardiner's playing {{contract}} was suspended indefinitely {{and he was}} fined $5,000 following his involvement in a traffic accident in the Perth suburb of Scarborough.

50|$|The {{following}} year, {{he again}} had a disappointing season, ending his year with 5 catches and 34 receiving yards. After graduating from Texas A&M {{with a degree}} in communications and having no eligibility left, his only option was to declare for the 2015 NFL Draft although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> he would <b>be</b> drafted due to his performance during his tenure at A&M.|$|R
50|$|As a young boy, Kevin {{was struck}} by a car and forced into {{traction}} and a body cast for many months.

Warren recovered and went on to be recruited to play college basketball.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that this}} {{reaction}} {{will be able}} to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{enduring}} legacies of the Oregon Trail is {{the expansion of}} the United States territory to the West Coast.

25|$|A 2003 {{paper from}} {{researchers}} at Monash University noted that Gilovich et al. did not examine the statistical {{power of their}} own experiments.

50|$|Eating disorders, {{once thought}} {{prevalent}} only in Western cultures {{such as that}} of the United States, are now seen in Chinese women. This is surprising as, in the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Their body shapes, including their round faces with mild plumpness, showed their beauty and healthy living. Thus, once thought unusual in China, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders are almost as common now as they are in Western countries.|$|R

25|$|Third is {{the case}} of Captain Tenodor Ten Eyck. Sent by Carrington to support or rescue Fetterman when the sounds of battle were heard at Fort Kearny, the captain was accused of having been slow to march to the aid of Fetterman, taking a longer route to reach him. Ten Eyck was accused of cowardice and drunkenness, and {{permitted}} to retire from the army. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Ten Eyck, even had he taken the shortest route, would have arrived in time to assist Fetterman.|$|E
25|$|In 1656, Innocent X {{died and}} the project lost momentum. In 1657, Borromini {{resigned}} and Carlo Rainaldi was recalled who {{made a number of}} significant changes to Borromini’s design. Further alterations were made by Bernini including the façade pediment. In 1668, Carlo Rainaldi returned as architect and Ciro Ferri received the commission to fresco the dome interior which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Borromini intended. Further large scale statuary and coloured marbling were also added; again, these are not part of Borromini’s design repertoire which was orientated to white stucco architectural and symbolic motifs.|$|E

25|$|King Djer, Aha's son and successor, had 318 {{retainer}} sacrifices {{buried in}} his tomb, and 269 retainer sacrifices buried in enclosures surrounding his tomb.
