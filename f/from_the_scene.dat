5|$|After the {{explosion}} of the Citadel reactor from which Gordon was extracted by the G-Man and where Alyx Vance was left behind, time suddenly freezes. Several Vortigaunts appear and rescue Alyx from the blast. After she is rescued, the Vortigaunts appear before the G-Man and stand between him and Gordon. They teleport Gordon away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> much to the G-Man's displeasure.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Governor Fred W. Green arrived {{during the}} {{afternoon}} of the disaster and assisted in the relief work, carting bricks away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> The Lawrence Baking Company of Lansing sent a truck filled with pies and sandwiches which were served to rescuers in the township's community hall.|$|E
5|$|The program {{suggests}} that the reaction time of state-run television crews and police on Tiananmen Square demonstrates they had advance knowledge of the event. They observed that officers arrived almost immediately on the scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers are not standard equipment for police on Tiananmen Square; the nearest building that would house them was several minutes away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

5|$|Three men, Thomas Kenney, Aquilla Floyd, and Alexander Higginbotham, {{managed to}} escape. They eluded the warriors and arrived safely in Galena, Illinois three days later.

5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly converted to Islam, and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's {{vehicle was}} {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a bus on Stubbs Road shortly after midnight on 27 January 2010. She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted to walk away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E

5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; {{he was forced to}} anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E

Fleeing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially {{that she had}} been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E
5|$|With the Emperor's {{withdrawal}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> local {{governors and}} magnates emerged to claim power. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title for themselves, others, like Li Mi in Henan, contending themselves, {{for the time}} being, with more modest titles. Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos {{to recall the}} aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
