50|$|The Clarenville {{area has}} {{many of the}} {{physical}} features characteristic of the East Coast of Newfoundland and has a marine climate. It lies along the coastal slopes which rise from the Atlantic Ocean towards the interior central plateau of the island. The dominating physical feature is a ridge of broken peaks which rise to heights up to 152 meters above sea level parallel to the coast line. Bare Mountain, with an elevation of 156 meters above sea level, dominates the skyline {{in the northern part}} of the town. This ridge falls sharply towards the sea so that its coastal edge is characterized by moderate to severe slopes.Towards the southern part of Clarenville, the ridge is broken by a series of valleys which have cut their way through from the coast. The most notable of these is the valley formed by the Lower Shoal Harbour River and Dark Hole Brook and their seaward extension of Lower Shoal Harbour, a shallow and narrow indentation of the sea marked by small rock islands and tidal mud flats. The flats surrounding the river are marshy and subjected to flooding during spring runoff. The river serves as the main <b>drainage</b> <b>course</b> for the area behind the coastal ridge.|$|E

5000|$|The lagoon of Khniss {{used to have}} a {{particularly}} rich marine biodiversity that until a recent past sustained pretty well the livelihood of local fishermen families. A traditional ecological fishing method known as [...] "Demmassa" [...] was widely employed in the region and used to be productive enough for all. However, in the last few decades, the lagoon witnessed a combination of serious environmental problems that are endangering its unique ecological equilibrium. Pollution, poor planning and the complete absence of sustainable preservation strategies are the main reasons of this environmental disaster. For instance, poor planning can be witnessed in the hastily built system that deviates the rain waters to protect the airport of Skanes-Monastir and the neighboring presidential summer palace. The construction of a sand barrier (Drina) in front of the <b>drainage</b> <b>course</b> of rain waters worsened the problems. The pollution due to urban and industrial waste waters further strangled the environment and is most probably the main reason for the depletion of the marine biodiversity of the lagoon.

Flowing through Poonamallee, it enters the Chennai District at Arumbakkam after meandering for about 54 km. It then passes through some of the oldest residential areas for another 18 km such as Choolaimedu, Chetpet, Egmore and Chintadripet, where the river channel is about 30 m wide. Close to Egmore, the river forks into two—the northern and the southern arms—both of which join again near the Napier bridge, thus forming an island, known as the Island Grounds. The northern part of the Buckingham Canal joins the Cooum near the old Central Jail while {{the southern part of the}} same canal emerges from the river, just behind the University of Madras campus. The river finally joins the Bay of Bengal south of the Fort St George, just below the Napier Bridge.

An internal drainage experiment for assessing downward movement of soil water {{under the influence of}} gravity was conducted on a semiarid sandy soil at ICRISAT-Sadore in Niger. The objectives were to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions K(θ) at multiple scales using soil water (θ) data determined over the drainage process, and to determine spatial characteristics of K(θ) functions for water management in the semiarid environment. The study site was a naturally rolling field and the soil was a sandy Labucheri soil series. The experimental design consisted of a nested grid with three scales, 1 × 1 -m, 5 × 5 -m and 20 × 20 -m, using 182 neutron access tubes. Soil water movement in space was examined in the 0. 15 – 1. 50 m depth throughout the <b>drainage</b> <b>course.</b> Mean soil water downward movement varied between 0. 029 – 1379 mm h− 1, depending on water content and soil depth. Elevation features contributed to 16 – 40 % of the variation in hydraulic conductivity functions (K(θ) = e·θf). The best fit for K(θ) -model coefficients was a normal distribution and K(θ) functions were correlated at the three scales (0. 81 < R 2 < 0. 96, P < 0. 01). The scaled K(θ) functions were auto-correlated in space within 25 – 60 m.

40|$|Yucca Mountain {{in southwestern}} Nevada is a prominent, irregularly shaped upland formed by a thick apron of Miocene pyroclastic-flow and fallout tephra deposits, with minor lava flows, that was {{segmented}} by through-going, large-displacement normal faults {{into a series}} of north-trending, eastwardly tilted structural blocks. The principal volcanic-rock units are the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring Tuffs of the Paintbrush Group, which consist of volumetrically large eruptive sequences derived from compositionally distinct magma bodies in the nearby southwestern Nevada volcanic field, and are classic examples of a magmatic zonation characterized by an upper crystal-rich (> 10 % crystal fragments) member, a more voluminous lower crystal-poor (< 5 % crystal fragments) member, and an intervening thin transition zone. Rocks within the crystal-poor member of the Topopah Spring Tuff, lying some 280 m below the crest of Yucca Mountain, constitute the proposed host rock to be excavated for the storage of high-level radioactive wastes. Separation of the tuffaceous rock formations into subunits that allow for detailed mapping and structural interpretations is based on macroscopic features, most importantly the relative abundance of lithophysae and the degree of welding. The latter feature, varying from nonwelded through partly and moderately welded to densely welded, exerts a strong control on matrix porosities and other rock properties that provide essential criteria for distinguishing hydrogeologic and thermal-mechanical units, which are of major interest in evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain to host a safe and permanent geologic repository for waste storage. A thick and varied sequence of surficial deposits mantle large parts of the Yucca Mountain site area. Mapping of these deposits and associated soils in exposures and in the walls of trenches excavated across buried faults provides evidence for multiple surface-rupturing events along all of the major faults during Pleistocene and Holocene times; these paleoseismic studies form the basis for evaluating the potential for future earthquakes and fault displacements. Thermoluminescence and U-series analyses were used to date the surficial materials involved in the Quaternary faulting events. The rate of erosional downcutting of bedrock on the ridge crests and hillslopes of Yucca Mountain, being of particular concern with respect to the potential for breaching of the proposed underground storage facility, was studied by using rock varnish cation-ratio and {sup 10 }Be and {sup 36 }Cl cosmogenic dating methods to determine the length of time bedrock outcrops and hillslope boulder deposits were exposed to cosmic rays, which then served as a basis for calculating long-term erosion rates. The results indicate rates ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 27 cm/k. y., which represent the maximum downcutting along the summit of Yucca Mountain under all climatic conditions that existed there during most of Quaternary time. Associated studies include the stratigraphy of surficial deposits in Fortymile Wash, the major <b>drainage</b> <b>course</b> in the area, which record a complex history of four to five cut-and-fill cycles within the channel during middle to late Quaternary time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Purpose of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and field test a model for context {{evaluation}} of objectives used in competency-based curricula at the community college level. The study: 1. Developed a decision and information matrix that identified objectives which should be considered for deletion from the given curriculum. 2. Determined whether each objective in the revised curriculum was an improvement over its counterpart in the original curriculum. 3. Determined, for each objective in the original curriculum as well as the revised curriculum, whether there were significant differences in ratings given by the five juries. Procedure: An overview of the procedure is as follows: 1. The research instrument was developed and then refined via field tests. 2. A competency-based community college course was selected for the study. The selected course was "Soils and Drainage'," which was a three-credit hour course in the first year of the Landscape Technology program at Portland Community College. 3. Five juries were used in this study. The juries were: a. Students' Jury b. Program Completers' Jury c. Non-Advisory Committee Experts' Jury d. Advisory Committee Jury e. Instructors' Jury 4. In April 1978, all five juries met at the College for a luncheon or dinner meeting to evaluate the 109 objectives in the Soils and <b>Drainage</b> <b>course.</b> 5. The following statistical data was computed on the Statistical Package for the Social_Sciences at Oregon State University: a. 218 Paired "t" Tests b. 218 One-Way Analysis of Variance Tests c. Five Least Significant Difference Tests (LSD Test) d. Five Student-Newman-Keuls Tests 6. Based on the statistical data and written comments made by the jury members, some objectives were added, deleted, or modified. The title of the course was also changed. 7. In October 1978, the revised curriculum was evaluated by the same juries. 8. The same statistical tests were run on the revised curriculum as were run on the original curriculum. In addition, the Wilcoxon Matched- Pairs Signed-Ranks Test was used to compare the original curriculum and the revised curriculum. 9. The study report was written. Conclusions: The conclusions listed below are based upon findings of the study. Such conclusions may, or may not, have applicability beyond this study. The conclusions of this study are: 1. Use of the context evaluation model developed in this study can identify objectives which are not appropriate for the stated purposes of a given curriculum. Elimination of such objectives has implications for all levels of education because errors in the selection of objectives can be costly in terms of staffing, facilities, equipment, materials, and can be a poor investment for the taxpayer as well as a waste of time and money for the students. 2. Knowledgeable individuals from outside the educational institution will reject few, if any, of the objectives for a given curriculum if the development and evaluation model presented in this study is utilized. 3. With respect to objectives developed by the model presented in this study, there will be no significant difference in the ratings given by instructors as compared to ratings given by other juries representing students and knowledgeable individuals from outside the educational institution. 4. Students' and instructors' ratings of the revised curriculum will be much closer to each other than were their ratings of the original curriculum. 5. The Matrix for Analysis of Rated Competencies (MARC) is an effective tool for organizing and displaying the statistical information regarding each objective, as well as for assisting the instructional team in making decisions regarding the objectives...|$|E
40|$|Triaenopogon {{barbatus}} Gunther is plump goby, some 70 mm {{in total}} length, with barbels and trilobed teeth bands (Fig. 2). It is distributed in China, Formosa and Japan, and abundantly found in Ariake Sound, {{on the western}} coast of Kyushu, Japan. Ariake Sound is a large bay of muddy, shallow water, less than twenty metres in depth at the inner part; and there occur fast tidal currents. The fish-fauna of this sound, including more than twenty species of Gobioid fishes, shows special characteristics different from other bays of Japan (Fig. 1). The three allied Gobioid fishes, Triaenopogon barbatus (Giinther), Tridentiger trigonocephalus (Gill) and Tridentiger undicervicus Tomiyama live a similar bottom-life in the same muddy shallows in the innermost part of the sound. Triaenopogon barbatus (Gunther) inhabits the oyster-beds of soft muddy tidal flat (Fig. 3). The sexes are easily distinguished in this goby of over 40 mm in total length, by {{the structure of the}} urogenital papilla. In the male, this organ is conical and pointed at its tip, whereas in the female it is truncate at its tip. The ripe ovarian eggs included two egg-groups, one the ripe egg-group, 0. 48 -. - 0. 90 mm in egg-diameter, and the another the unripe egg-group, less 0. 05 mm. This ripe egg-group seemed to be spawned at one time. The number of ripe ovarian eggs is enumerated 2, 610 to 23, 365 in four individuals (Table 1). The ripe testis is a white, thick band-form organ with a leaf of the appendant organ (2 ̆ 2 Seminal vesicle 2 ̆ 2 : Weisel, G. F. 1949). The spawning occured in the above-mentioned habitat from May to September, mainly in July. The spawned eggs were deposited, in one-layer, on the inner surface of the cleaned empty shell of Ostrea rivularis Gould on the tidal flat. The number of eggs of one mass was enumerated 7, 791 and 15, 841 in two cases; and each spawned egg-mass wholly consisted of the eggs in similar developmental stage as were observed in over twenty cases. The spawning-act seemed to occur at the tidal flood, and when the act finished the female parent fish left the nest, whereas the male which had remarkably compressed head, was found guarding the spawned eggs until they hatched (Fig. 3). The observational data collected from the spawning-ground seemed to show the polygamous habit of the large male fish. It is yet unknown how many times one female fish spawned in one season. In this species, the size of the nest generally corresponded with the size of the guarding male parent fish. Also the size-order of the nest (oyster shell) of the three, allied gobies, spawned in the similar spawning-ground of oyster-bed at the same time, were recognized as corresponding with the size-order of the male parent of these gobies; that is Triaenopogon barbatus, Tridentiger trigonocephalus, and Tridentiger undicervicus (Table 2). The spawned egg is demersal, ellipsoid in shape, about 1. 5 mm in longer axis, 0. 5 mm in shorter axis, with a bundle of adhesive filaments at its basal end. The incubation-period is about four days at the water-temperature about 25 ℃ (Fig. 4). The newly hatched larva is about 2. 5 mm in total length. This larva consumed its yolk entirely in three days after hatched at the same water-temperature in egg-development (Fig. 5). The post-larvae, less than 10 mm in total length, was not yet collected. The post-larvae of 10 - 17 mm were found to live a swimming-life in the deeper <b>drainage</b> <b>course</b> of the mud flat from June to October, feeding on planktonic Copepods and Crustacean larvae. Together with the larvae of this goby, two gobies, Tridentiger trigonocephalus and T. undicervicus of similar size, 10 - 15 mm in total length, were collected with the set-nets in the estuary from June to July. The juveniles, over 17 mm in total length, were found from July to October entered into the bottom-life in the same habitat of the adult. The examination of gut-contents of the young as well as the adult fish showed that Annelida, small Crustaceans, squid, and young fish, including the young of this goby and Tridentiger trigonocephalus, constitute the diet. This goby seems to grow 40 - 85 mm in total length in a year, and to become mature in most individuals; 85 - 115 mm in two years; over 120 mm in three years, based upon the size-frequency. The smallest female adult examined was 53 mm in total length (43 mm in standard length). The life-span seemed to be over three years. 有明海の魚類相が日本の他の内湾水域のそれと較べて特異なものであることは多くの研究者がすでに報告している(Tanaka,S. 1931 :内田,塚原 1955). 筆者は当教室で行つている「有明海産魚類生活史の研究」の一部として 1947 年(昭和 22 年) 以来, 同海域に産する二十余種のハゼ類の生態, 生活史の研究を行い, その結果からそこに産するハゼ類の生活相についても他の内湾のそれと較べてみて多くの特異点があることを確めることが出来た. ここでは有明海奥部に多数棲息するショウキハゼ Triaenopogon barbatus (Gunther) の生態, 生活史について, それと密接な生活関係を保ちながら棲んでいると考えられる近縁の 2 種類のハゼ:シロチチブ Trideyttiger undicervicus Tomiyama およびシマハゼ Tridentiger trigonocephalus (Gill) との相互の生活関係を考えながら述べる...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The stratigraphic {{architecture}} of intracontinental rift basins {{is defined by}} a dynamic relationship between depositional processes associated with the basin floor and flanking tributary streams. The resulting depositional belts are sensitive {{to a variety of}} factors, including basin geometry, subsidence rate, and sediment discharge. The Experimental EarthScape run in 2006 (XES 06) examined the development of fluvial morphology and alluvial architecture as a function of subsidence and sediment flux in an experimental basin based on the form of a simple half graben. Sediments from tributary drainages were introduced into the axial stream through toe cutting and realignment of transverse <b>drainage</b> <b>courses</b> to parallel the prevailing axial-flow direction. Transverse sediment contributions to the axial stream were almost equally apportioned over a wide range of sediment discharges tested in the experiments. Sediment tracers showed a larger contribution of footwall-derived sediment into the axial belt, probably due to more frequent and aggressive toe cutting by axial streams. Changes in the axial–transverse deposit boundary to external forcing (by subsidence and sediment discharge), and relatively rapid intrastage stabilization of the depositional belts, resembles the large-scale self-organization observed in moving boundaries that define the morphology of fluviodeltaic systems. Basin sedimentation was matched to subsidence in order to maintain a constant base level, which made the location and width of the axial belt sensitive to the relative sediment fluxes from the transverse systems, rathe...|$|R

Fifty Simmental calves were treated for 5 days with 60 mg/kg/day of oxytetracycline. After 15 days the animals were treated for 5 days with 20 mg/kg/day of tylosin. Tylosin degraded rapidly, and was no longer detected in manure 45 days after cessation of treatment and no trace of the compound was detected in soil or surrounding water (detection limits 10 microg/l). The half-life of oxytetracycline in manure was 30 days and the compound was still detectable in this matrix (820 microg/kg) after 5 months maturation. In the manured soil oxytetracycline was detected at concentrations at least 10 times lower than the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products threshold (100 microg/kg) requiring phase II environmental risk assessment. Oxytetracycline was not detected in the water courses (detection limit 1 microg/l). These results demonstrate that the processes occurring between faeces production and application of manure to the soil are very effective in reducing the load of TYL and OTC in the environment.

The solid geology of the area is dominated by volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks of Mesozoic age, including volcanic tufts and lava, granites and quartzphyric and feldsparphyric rhyolite dykes. These have weathered and a mantle of saprolite and residual soil covers much of the terrain. The onshore superficial soils include colluvium and alluvium whilst offshore, thick deposits of Holocene marine muds and Pleistocene alluvium overlie the weathered bedrock. The main geological and geotechnical constraints to development on land in the North Lantau area are: the possible adverse ffect of relict joints on the stability of cut slopes, potential stability problems on natural slopes due to steep, colluvium covered slopes, boulder fields and the possible remobilization of colluvium within <b>drainage</b> <b>courses</b> during rainstorms. Difficulties may also be encountered with piled foundations due to the presence of large boulders in deposits of alluvium and colluvium. Offshore, the presence of thick deposits of compressible marine mud represents the main difficulty for the planned reclamations along the coastline...|$|R
50|$|Located {{directly}} downstream of the Little Colorado River confluence {{with the}} Colorado River, the Tanner Graben, in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA is a prominence and cliffside rock formation below the East Rim. Tanner Graben is located riverside, on the Colorado River, on a north-northwest bank at Mile 68.5, and lies opposite Tanner Canyon. The Tanner Rapid, created by Tanner Creek {{lies at the}} riverside foot of the graben. The graben is a pronounced feature because of the black Cardenas Basalt that forms the middle section of the graben, presumably free of debris accumulation by its cliff face steepness, and winds, and airflow <b>drainage</b> that <b>course</b> through the Colorado River's canyons; unprotected side canyons of Cardenas Basalt show accumulations as a slope-forming geologic unit, with little showing of black basalt.|$|R
50|$|The placer gold {{produced}} from this district was recovered by ground sluicing and hydraulic mining in earlier years, and by dragline dredging in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1850s, {{during the great}} California Gold Rush, Chinese laborers, with their legendary patience and thoroughness, mined much of the placer gold within Six Bit Gulch, a major <b>drainage</b> channel that <b>courses</b> through the natural area. The dredging of Six Bit Gulch and Poor Man's Gulch produced over $100,000 worth of gold.|$|R
40|$|Ago-Iwoye –Ilisan road is {{the major}} road that links Abeokuta the state capital of Ogun –state to Ijebu towns. The road has always been {{experiencing}} pavement failure, which occurs inform of cracks and potholes. Being the major road, {{the effect of the}} failure has negative impact on the soico-economic growth of Ijebu –areas. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} determine the influence of the geotechnical properties of the sub-grade materials on the pavement performance of Ago-Iwoye – Ilishan Road. Eleven (11) soil samples were collected at eight (8) different locations with the aid of hand auger and were air-dried before taken to the laboratory for determination of engineering properties. The Liquid limit and the Plastic limits ranged from 13. 9 – 46. 2 % and 8. 1 – 32. 7 %, with the Plasticity index from 10. 6 – 15. 9 % and Shrinkage limit from 6. 2 – 27. 7 % respectively. The soaked CBR values of the subgrade materials is between 67 % and 75 % compared with 30 % minimum specified by FMWH, 1997. The soils were classified by ASSHTO under the A- 6 and A- 7 category which shows that the soils are fair to poor as a sub-grade material and USCS classification shows that the soil falls into the SM and SC group. The comparison of all the results with the Nigeria specification (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing general guidelines) for the sub grade materials along the Ago-Iwoye- Ilisian road show that the materials underlain the pavement do satisfy the Nigeria standard. Therefore, the perennial failure frequently experience along the road route is not significantly influenced by subgrade materials. Hence, influence of other factors such as poor <b>drainage</b> <b>courses,</b> level of groundwater table, variation of geologic materials along the road route and poor construction materials should be thoroughly addressed before embarking on future rehabilitation of the highway. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Kinloch Hourn {{fault is}} the most {{prominent}} of a number of suspected postglacial faults in the western Scottish Highlands. These faults are interpreted to have been reactivated by repeated large (M > 6) palaeoseismic events following deglaciation 10, 000 – 13, 000 years ago. Based on inferred deflections of <b>drainage</b> <b>courses,</b> previous studies of the fault have estimated 160 ± 40 m cumulative left-lateral displacement along a 14 km long active segment during postglacial times. Reported soft-sediment deformation phenomena imply that activity on the Kinloch Hourn fault has persisted into the late Holocene, with the most recent movement having been associated with a magnitude 5. 5 – 6. 0 surface-faulting event between 3500 and 2400 years ago. The marked contrast between such palaeoseismic activity and the present-day seismic quiescence of western Scotland has stimulated this critical reappraisal of the Kinloch Hourn fault. This paper reassesses the key lines of evidence for postglacial fault activity and palaeoseismicty on the Kinloch Hourn fault, combining the analysis of 1 : 15, 000 -scale air photos, field-based geomorphic mapping and palaeoenvironmental investigations. Our reappraisal of inferred drainage deflections across the fault contends that previous reports of significant (10 ^ 2 m) left-lateral slip on the fault during the Holocene are spurious. Instead, incidences of Holocene channel abandonment along the fault line are non-synchronous and probably reflect non-tectonic drainage changes. The timing of soft-sediment deformation {{in the vicinity of the}} fault is revised to an early Holocene date (8990 – 8580 calendar years BP), which is in accord with both the palaeoenvironmental history of the site and consistent with published ages of earthquake-induced liquefaction phenomena documented elsewhere in western Scotland. An alleged recent (post- 2400 radiocarbon years BP) ground rupture on the fault is questioned in the light of uncertainty about both the nature of the faulted soil deposit and the late Holocene age attributed to it. The study concludes that there is no convincing evidence for postglacial surface rupture on the Kinloch Hourn fault and speculates that the case for significant (10 ^ 1 – 10 ^ 2 m) postglacial movement on other faults in western Scotland may be similarly `unproven'...|$|R

30|$|A 47 -year-old male {{patient with}} the {{acetabulum}} fracture underwent open reduction and internal fixation with hip arthroscopy. Hypothermia, increased airway pressure (under volume-controlled ventilation) and oliguria were observed during the operation, and arterial {{blood gas analysis}} showed decreased oxygenation and metabolic acidosis. Abdominal distention was observed, and a postoperative CT revealed accumulation of a large volume of irrigation fluid in the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum. The patient was diagnosed as having abdominal compartment syndrome and treated by percutaneous peritoneal <b>drainage.</b> His subsequent <b>course</b> was uneventful, and he was discharged 8  weeks after the operation. Intraperitoneal extravasation of irrigation fluid may occur during hip arthroscopic surgery, and {{is more likely to}} occur in the presence of an injury.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{development}} of new geosynthetics such as composite fabrics {{has been able to}} construct steep earthfill utilized high water content volcanic cohesive soils such as Kanto loam and/or even construction by-products which have never been used as fill materials.
