2500|$|Schieble {{gave birth}} to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was [...] "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy." [...] The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead. The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the {{adoption}} papers. She then took the matter to court {{in an attempt to}} have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college. When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she [...] "was too frightened to love [...] {{for the first six months}} of his life ... I was scared they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." [...] When Chrisann shared his mother's comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that [...] "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents." [...] Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as [...] "adoptive parents" [...] as they [...] "were my parents 1,000%." [...] With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as [...] "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more." [...] Jandali has also stated that [...] "I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don't want to take their place." ...|$|E

60|$|Several of the {{officers}} came in and chatted with {{him while he was}} packing, all expressing regret that he was leaving. At mess that evening they drank his health, and a pleasant journey; and he gravely returned thanks. When the mess broke up he returned to the bungalow, and packed a small canvas bag with the suit he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This {{was what}} suited Francie, {{but she was}} {{nevertheless}} struck by Delia's rigour. [...] "I'm only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to see Mr. Waterlow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Andy went in {{the back}} room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes. There was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that I didn't like.

60|$|In vain, Crawford {{declared}} {{that he would never}} have suffered the massacre if he had been present. Wingenund was willing to believe this, but he reminded him that the men whom he had led to Sandusky had {{declared that}} they came to murder the remaining Moravians. No one, he said, would now dare to speak a word for him; the king of England, if he came with all his treasure, could not save him from the vengeance which the Indians were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> upon <b>him</b> for the slaughter of their innocent brethren.|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, Reuben Hawkshaw {{had been}} {{carefully}} and quietly picking a crew. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with <b>him</b> fully {{twice as many}} as had, before, sufficed to navigate the Swan. Of the forty men who had sailed with him he had lost nine, and five others had not sufficiently recovered from their wounds to sail with him again. Of the remainder he engaged twenty, all of whom were stout and willing fellows who would, he knew, sail with him wherever he bid them. The remaining six, being given to grumbling, he would have none of, good sailors though they were.|$|R

5000|$|Albert's {{allotment}} provided {{something to}} do in his later years. When he feared the Council was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it off <b>him,</b> the neighbours agreed to help out, although he was furious when Ray Langton carved [...] "Albert rules OK" [...] into his marrow. Further, salad from his allotment {{was the cause of}} a sickness in the street when it was sold at the Corner Shop in 1978.|$|R
6000|$|The lines grew {{a trifle}} deeper in Ormsgill's forehead, but he smiled. [...] "I wouldn't go quite so far, though if Domingo {{still had the}} boys it might delay things. As it is, I don't think he will have them. How I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them from <b>him</b> I don't quite know, but I expect to make an attempt of some kind to-morrow. You see, these folks have no {{particular}} fondness for the Portuguese, and that will probably count for a little." ...|$|R

5000|$|Maj Gen Rees was {{provided}} Brig D.S. Brar and Brig M. Ayub Khan (who later became field marshal and President of Pakistan) from India and Pakistan respectively as [...] "Military Advisors". He was later provided Brig K.S. Thimayya (India) and Brig Nazir Ahmed (Pakistan) as [...] "Alternate Military Advisors". However, Gen Rees refused to heed advice from his advisors, {{which led to}} his being criticised; he rebuked Thimayya {{that he was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advice from <b>him</b> being ten years his senior. In addition, Rees was criticised by politicians from both sides.|$|R
60|$|B------, Mons. S------, {{and myself}} {{continue}} to live in the same style as heretofore. We appear mutually to be very well pleased with each other. Mons.

I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> lessons from <b>him</b> in the pronunciation of French. Of female society I see nothing.

6000|$|I cannot {{thank you}} too much for Sultan. He is a noble fellow, has fallen into {{the ways of the}} family with a grace and dignity that denote the gentleman, and came down to the railway a day or two since to welcome me home (it was our first meeting), with a {{profound}} absence of interest in my individual opinion of him which captivated me completely. I am <b>going</b> home to-day <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> about the country, and improve his acquaintance.

60|$|However, as she at once {{proceeded}} with her dictation, and as I interrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy {{as he was}} <b>going</b> out and <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> up <b>to</b> nurse. He looked very much astonished at it and at Ada's kissing him, but soon fell fast asleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he was quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the momentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all other places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it.|$|R
60|$|As to Afrosinia, he {{was well}} aware that she would know {{that he could not}} intend <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her <b>to</b> Copenhagen into his father's presence, and so he deceived her as to his real design, and induced her to set out with him, without suspicion, by telling her that he was only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her with <b>him</b> a part of the way. She was only to go, he said, as far as Riga, a town on the shores of the Baltic, on the way toward Copenhagen. Alexis was the less {{inclined}} to make a confidante of Afrosinia from {{the fact that she had}} never been willingly his companion. She was a Finland girl, a captive taken in war, and preserved to be sold as a slave on account of her beauty. When she came into the possession of Alexis he forced her to submit to his will. She was a slave, and it was useless for her to resist or complain. It is said that Alexis only induced her to yield to him by drawing his knife and threatening to kill her on the spot if she made any difficulty. Thus, although he seems to have become, in the end, strongly attached to her, he never felt that she was really and cordially on his side. He accordingly, in this case, concealed from her his real designs, and told her he was only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her with <b>him</b> a little way. He would then send her back, he said, to Petersburg. So Afrosinia made arrangements to accompany him without feeling any concern.|$|R
60|$|Victor and Harry were in {{the lowest}} gallery. They stood back from the front, but between the heads of those before them they could {{see what was going}} on below. Victor stood immovable, his face as pale as death. His cap had fallen off, his hair was dank with perspiration, his eyes had a look of {{concentrated}} horror, his body shook with a spasmodic shuddering. In vain Harry, when he once saw what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place, urged <b>him</b> in a low whisper to leave. He did not appear to hear, and even when Harry pulled him by the sleeve of his blouse he seemed equally unconscious. Harry was greatly alarmed, and feared that every moment his companion would betray himself by some terrible out-burst.|$|R
