A Ricardo E 6 Diesel version engine is converted to run on a dual fuel of Diesel and compressed natural gas and having an exhaust gas recycling system is used throughout the work. The engine is fully computerized, and the cylinder pressure data and crank angle data are stored in a PC for offline analysis.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A new quasi-dimensional, multi-zone model has been developed to describe the combustion processes occurring inside a dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> A dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is a compression ignition engine in which a homogeneous lean premixed charge of gaseous fuel and air is ignited by a pilot fuel spray. The atomisation and preparation of the pilot leads {{to the formation of}} multiple ignition centres from which turbulent flame fronts develop. The energy release in a dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is therefore a combination of that from the combustion of the pilot fuel spray and lean premixed charge. Hence, the dual fuel combustion process is complex, combining elements of both conventional spark and compression ignition <b>engines.</b> The dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is beneficial as it can achieve significant reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), as well as reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).

40|$|Based on the GT-Power software, {{an engine}} cycle {{simulation}} for a biodiesel fueled direct injection {{compression ignition engine}} was developed and used to study its performance and emission characteristics. The major objectives were to establish the engine model for simulation and then apply the model to study the biodiesel <b>fueled</b> <b>engine</b> and compare it to a petroleum-fueled engine. The engine model was developed corresponding to a 4. 5 liter, John Deere 4045 four-cylinder diesel engine. Submodels for flow in intake/exhaust system, fuel injection, fuel vaporization and combustion, cylinder heat transfer, and energy transfer in a turbocharging system were combined with a thermodynamic analysis of the engine to yield instantaneous in-cylinder parameters and overall engine performance and emission characteristics. At selected engine operating conditions, sensitivities of engine performance and emission on engine load/speed, injection timing, injection pressure, EGR level, and compression ratio were investigated. Variations in cylinder pressure, ignition delay, bsfc, and indicated specific nitrogen dioxide were determined for both a biodiesel <b>fueled</b> <b>engine</b> and a conventional diesel <b>fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> Cylinder pressure and indicated specific nitrogen dioxide for a diesel <b>fueled</b> <b>engine</b> were consistently higher than those for a biodiesel <b>fueled</b> <b>engine,</b> while ignition delay and bsfc had opposite trends.

40|$|The engine, {{which uses}} both {{conventional}} diesel fuel and LPG fuel, {{is referred to}} as ‘LPG–diesel dual fuel engines’. LPG dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> are modified diesel engines which use primary fuel as LPG and secondary fuel as diesel. LPG dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> have a good thermal efficiency at high output but the performance is less during part load conditions due to the poor utilization of charges. This problem can be overcome by varying factors such as pilot fuel quantity, injection timing, composition of the gaseous fuel and intake charge conditions, for improving the performance, combustion and emissions of dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines.</b> This article reviews about the research work done by the researchers in order to improve the performance, combustion and emission parameters of a LPG–diesel dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines.</b> From the studies it is shown that the use of LPG in diesel engine is one of the capable methods to reduce the PM and NOx emissions but at same time at part load condition there is a drop in efficiency and power output with respect to diesel operation...|$|R

40|$|Natural gas (NG) -diesel dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> {{have been}} criticized for their high {{emissions}} of unburned methane. The past research on methane emissions from dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> has focused on the measurement of methane concentration in exhaust gases. The development of approaches capable of minimizing methane emissions requests the detailed spatial distribution of methane in-cylinder during the combustion and post combustion processes. However, it is difficult to experimentally measure the spatial distribution of methane in-cylinder. This research presents a numerical study on the combustion process of a NG-diesel dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> using the computational fluids dynamics (CFD) model CONVERGE coupled with a reduced primary reference fuel (PRF) mechanism. The model was validated against the heat release process and the emissions of nitrogen oxide, methane and carbon monoxide measured in a single cylinder dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> The validated CFD model was applied to investigate the combustion of methane and n-heptane and the spatial distribution of methane in the dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> This is most likely the first attempt to visualize the spatial distribution of methane in dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> using CFD. The objective {{of this study is to}} numerically simulate the methane combustion process, especially the methane present outside the pilot spray, quantify the methane combustion in each combustion stage, and visualize the spatial methane distribution in cylinder. The results showed that the momentum produced by the pilot fuel injection and combustion pushed the combustion products of pilot fuel and methane within the pilot spray plume toward the unburned methane-air mixture. Such a movement enhanced the mixing of the hot combustion products and the relatively cold unburned methane-air mixture during the main combustion process and dominated the combustion of methane presented outside the pilot fuel spray plume. Based on the simulation results at a low load condition (4. 05 bar), the main combustion process consumed 432 ̆ 01353...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been made to reduce the {{pollution}} caused by Direct Injection (DI) diesel engines during the past decades. One of the promising engineering solutions is the use of gaseous fuels as a supplement for liquid diesel <b>fuel.</b> These <b>engines,</b> which use conventional diesel fuel and gaseous fuel, are referred to as dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engines.</b> The main objective of the dual fuel combustion systems is to reduce particulate emissions and nitrogen oxides. One of the gaseous fuels used is natural gas, which is a clean burning fuel, economical and possesses a relatively high auto ignition temperature. The high auto ignition temperature of natural gas is a serious advantage against other gaseous fuels since the compression ratio of most conventional DI diesel engines can be maintained. Furthermore, the combustion of natural gas produces practically no particulates since natural gas contains less dissolved impurities (e. g., sulfur compounds). The current study investigates the tribological performance of dual <b>fuel</b> diesel <b>engine</b> used oil. A set of used oil samples was taken from the dual <b>fuel</b> diesel <b>engine</b> after 25 hrs, 50 hrs and 100 hrs of operation at full load. A standard ball on disc friction-wear testing machine was used to study the impact of the above mentioned used oils on the friction and wear of various engine components. The results showed that the dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> used oil showed a much better behavior than the traditional diesel engine used oil in terms of friction and wear behavior for the four different levels of operating times. The difference was more significant at the longer operation time. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is a cleaner engine; hence it produces lower soot content than the diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{the global}} {{shortage}} of oil resource and the {{rapid increase in}} car ownership, using gas as the alternative fuel is {{getting more and more}} important. Gas fuel, such as LNG (liquefied natural gas), with resource-rich, less pollution and other features, is desirable alternative fuels for cars. In this article, through the engine bench test, a comparative analysis of power performance, fuel econ-omy, emission between diesel/LNG dual engine and diesel engine was done. The result shows that, compared to the original machine, power performance of modified diesel / LNG dual <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> decline but isn’t obvious. At the same time, fuel economy has a substantial increase. The use of natural gas can relieve shortage of global oil resource and the supply-demand imbalance of oil products.
