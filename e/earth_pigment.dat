The Romans made a fine green <b>earth</b> <b>pigment</b> that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E

They also used less expensive green <b>earth</b> <b>pigment,</b> or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.|$|E

50|$|Raw sienna is a yellowish-brown natural <b>earth</b> <b>pigment,</b> {{composed}} {{primarily of}} iron oxide hydroxide. The box shows the colour of the pigment in its natural, or raw state.

5000|$|Sinopia (also {{known as}} sinoper, {{named after the}} Turkish city Sinop) is a dark reddish-brown natural <b>earth</b> <b>pigment,</b> whose reddish colour comes from hematite, a {{dehydrated}} form of iron oxide. It was widely used in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages for painting, and during the Renaissance it was often used on the rough initial layer of plaster for the underdrawing for a fresco. The word came to be used both for the pigment and for the preparatory drawing itself, which may be revealed when a freaco is stripped from its wall for transfer.|$|E
5000|$|Sienna (from terra di Siena, [...] "Siena earth") is an <b>earth</b> <b>pigment</b> {{containing}} {{iron oxide}} and manganese oxide. In its natural state, it is yellow-brown and is called raw sienna. When heated, {{it becomes a}} reddish brown and is called burnt sienna. It {{takes its name from}} the city-state of Siena, where it was produced during the Renaissance. Along with ochre and umber, {{it was one of the}} first pigments to be used by humans, and is found in many cave paintings. Since the Renaissance, it has been one of the brown pigments most widely used by artists.|$|E

30|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was confirmed by}} means of microscopic examinations of paint samples. The cross-sections supplied additional information establishing that the works on canvas were all prepared with a double ground. The first is a thin reddish brown ground composed of mainly fine-grained <b>earth</b> <b>pigments,</b> a few particles of umber and chalk, as demonstrated by EDX spot analysis. A thicker grayish brown layer follows, containing a mixture of primarily lead white with fewer particles of umber, red <b>earth</b> <b>pigments</b> and chalk.|$|R
40|$|The {{reflectance}} model {{developed by}} Kubelka and Munk was evaluated for agreement in color prediction of thick pigmented samples and for linearity of optical absorption and scattering coefficients with concentration of colorant in maxillofacial elastomer. The colorants tested were generic opacifiers, dry mineral <b>earth</b> <b>pigments,</b> and fibrous colorants. Significant linear relationships were commonly {{found between the}} optical coefficients and the concentration of the colorants. These relationships indicated occasional optical interaction between the colorants and the elastomer. Color differences between theoretical and observed colors of the thick samples averaged 2. 96, 3. 47, and 1. 60 for the opacifiers, mineral <b>earth</b> <b>pigments,</b> and fibrous colorants, respectively, when measured using the CIELAB uniform-color space.

5000|$|Van Dyck brown, {{known in}} Europe as Cologne earth or Cassel earth, is another natural <b>earth</b> <b>pigment,</b> {{that was made}} up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It {{takes its name from}} the painter Anthony van Dyck, but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly {{unstable}} and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue.|$|E
5000|$|During the Renaissance, pink {{was mainly}} {{used for the}} flesh color of faces and hands. The pigment {{commonly}} used for this was called light cinabrese; it {{was a mixture of}} the red <b>earth</b> <b>pigment</b> called sinopia, or Venetian red, and a white pigment called Bianco San Genovese, or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, Il Libro Dell'Arte, Cennino Cennini described it this way: [...] "This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John’s white, as it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime. And when these two pigments have been thoroughly mulled together (that is, two parts cinabrese and the third white), make little loaves of them like half walnuts and leave them to dry. When you need some, take however much of it seems appropriate. And this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls..." ...|$|E
