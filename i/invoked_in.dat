5|$|The Eye of Ra was {{involved}} {{in many areas of}} ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with it. Its life-giving power was celebrated in temple rituals, and its dangerous aspect was <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the protection of the pharaoh, of sacred places, and of ordinary people and their homes.|$|E
5|$|The Third Amendment {{has been}} <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> a few {{instances}} as helping establish an implicit {{right to privacy}} in the Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along {{with others in the}} Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which cited the Third Amendment as implying a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.|$|E

5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the poem.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{practice}} of cursing and sorcery peculiar to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is located in an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town of Kataragama. His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> sorcery practices.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

40|$|The] {{understanding}} {{which is}} relevant to the sciences of man is something more than this implicit grasp on things. It is related rather {{to the kind of}} understanding we <b>invoke</b> <b>in</b> personal relations when we say, for instance: ‘I find him hard to understand’; or at last I understand her’. To switch for a minute to another language, {{it is the kind of}} understanding one <b>invokes</b> <b>in</b> French when one says ‘maintenant on s’entend’. We are talking here in these cases of what you could call human understanding, understanding what makes someone tick, or how he feels or acts as a human being. (Taylor, 1980, p. 30) ...|$|R
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Njörðr is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from earlier}} traditional sources, the Prose Edda, {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, in euhemerized form as a beloved mythological early king of Sweden in Heimskringla, also written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, as one of three gods <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the 14th century Hauksbók ring oath, and in numerous Scandinavian place names. Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice, where the god is recorded as Njor and thanked for a bountiful catch of fish.|$|E
5|$|A rarely {{enforced}} 1958 law— {{known as}} Decree Number 10— was <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> May 1963 to prohibit {{the display of}} religious flags. This disallowed the flying of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists {{on the eve of}} the most important religious festival of the year, as a week earlier Catholics had been encouraged to display Vatican flags at a government-sponsored celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, the most senior Catholic cleric in the country. On 8 May in Huế, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army broke up the demonstration by firing guns at and throwing grenades into the gathering, leaving nine people dead.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> {{the process of the}} suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The {{battle is}} commemorated with a monument, which {{includes}} a bronze statue of Minerva {{near the top of}} Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli had a {{profound}} influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which {{changed the course of}} the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the controversies of this period.|$|E

25|$|There are Protestants, {{especially}} of the Reformed tradition, that either reject or down-play the designation Protestant because of the negative idea that the word <b>invokes</b> <b>in</b> addition to its primary meaning, preferring the designation Reformed, Evangelical or even Reformed Catholic expressive {{of what they call}} a Reformed Catholicity and defending their arguments from the traditional Protestant confessions.|$|R

5|$|Several large {{stones are}} set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each {{identified}} by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the main site at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after its death, the animal was cut into pieces and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> royal speeches and decrees to allude {{to the fate of}} those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.|$|E
