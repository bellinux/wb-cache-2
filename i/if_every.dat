5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected <b>if</b> <b>every</b> vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|In a {{few words}} there is 2000 Mexican {{soldiers}} in Bexar, and 150 Americans in the Alamo. Sesma is {{at the head of}} them, and from best accounts that can be obtained, they intend to show no quarter. <b>If</b> <b>every</b> man cannot turn out to a man every man in the Alamo will be murdered.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. <b>If</b> <b>every</b> non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

50|$|An n-vertex graph G is pancyclic <b>if,</b> for <b>every</b> k in {{the range}} 3 ≤ k ≤ n, G {{contains}} a cycle of length k.

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and <b>if</b> <b>every</b> character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X <b>if</b> <b>every</b> group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
