5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: <b>jumps,</b> and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their <b>jumps.</b> The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the <b>jumps</b> for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E

5000|$|In 1949, Shueisha {{got into}} the {{business}} of making manga magazines, the first being Omoshiro Book. In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled Shōjo Book. Shōjo Book led to the publication of the highly successful Shōjo manga magazine: Ribon. Omoshiro Book went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful Shōjo Book to even it out and made the magazine Shōnen Book. In the middle of Shōnen Books publication, Shōnen <b>Jump</b> began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no [...] "Weekly"). Shōnen Book ended when Shōnen <b>Jump</b> became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump.</b> In 1969 a special issue called Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump</b> took Shōnen Books place. In addition to the success of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> Shueisha created a Seinen version of the magazine in 1979, called Young <b>Jump</b> (now Weekly Young <b>Jump).</b> Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> later got renamed Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and became a magazine of its own. The seasonal issues of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> are now called Akamaru <b>Jump.</b> In 1985, Shueisha started the publication of two business related manga magazines; a salaryman <b>Jump</b> magazine called Business <b>Jump</b> and an office lady manga magazine called Office You, also in 1988 started the publication of Super <b>Jump.</b> Many other Seinen related <b>Jump</b> magazines, started as spin-off issues of the Weekly Young <b>Jump</b> magazine. In 1993, Shueisha announced and released the video game/manga magazine V <b>Jump</b> alongside the <b>Jump</b> light novel line <b>Jump</b> j-Books. In 2003 Shogakukans Viz Media released an English version of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> called Shonen <b>Jump.</b> Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> discontinued in 2007 and was replaced with the <b>Jump</b> SQ. magazine, four series from the magazine were moved. In addition to the <b>Jump</b> SQ. anthology, a spin-off issue was created, called <b>Jump</b> SQ.II (Second). Saikyō <b>Jump</b> was started on December 3, 2010, with close ties to Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and V <b>Jump.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Jumping</b> {{is another}} type of motion analysis. We have long <b>jump,</b> triple <b>jump,</b> static <b>jump</b> and leap frog <b>jump.</b> The long <b>jump</b> which athletes combine speed, {{strength}} and agility {{in an attempt to}} land as far from the take-off point as possible. The triple <b>jump</b> occurred when the athlete runs down a runway until he reaches a designated mark, from which the <b>jump</b> is measured. The leap frog <b>jump</b> means <b>jumping</b> by both foots by maintains subjects kneels or bends over for the next <b>jump.</b> The static <b>jump</b> means <b>jumping</b> with both foots at one place. In this study, we will acquire the force, moment and center of pressure. This experiment will consist of subjects standing on two feet, wearing and not wearing shoes. The comparison will be made between long <b>jump</b> vs triple <b>jump</b> and static <b>jump</b> vs leap frog <b>jump.</b> The experiment was held at Biomechanic and Motion Analysis Laboratory, UniMAP. Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) software been used for this purpose where this software aid us in analyzing motion of the subject as shown in Figure 1. Two Bertec force plate and five high frequency cameras were used to capture the motion of the subjects while doing the experiment. The result shown force exerted at toe will be highest in leap frog <b>jump</b> compare to others...|$|R
