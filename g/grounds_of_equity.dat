Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy {{and the lack of}} intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense, claims a reward only on the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> This early-scholastic distinction and terminology, which developed in the controversies with the Pelagians and Semipelagians, were again emphasized by Johann Eck, the famous adversary of Martin Luther (cf. Greying, [...] "Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter," [...] Münster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.). The essential difference between meritum de condigno and meritum de congruo is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> (ex œquitate) or mere distributive justice (ex iustitia distributiva), {{as in the case of}} gratuities and military decorations. From an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination (acceptio personarum). Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will.|$|R

This paper examines some of the factors responsible for the continued existence of sizable earnings differentials between the sexes. In and of itself, the existence of an earnings differential is not necessarily indicative of the extent of labor market discrimination. The crucial question is: What proportion of the observed differential is attributable to discrimina-tion and what proportion is justifiable on some generally accepted <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Looked at in this way, it is clear that the success or failure of legislation in reducing discrimination cannot be measured by changes in the gross earnings differential alone.

We address the help that parents give {{their children in the}} job market using data from the new age 42 wave of the 1970 British Cohort Study.

We first assess the extent and type of help. We then determine whether people from higher socio-economic status families are more or less likely to have such help and whether the help is associated with higher wages and higher occupations. Our paper provides insight into whether the strong link between parental socio-economic background and the individual's own economic success can be explained in part by the parents assisting their children to get jobs.

The current issues faced by micro-entrepreneurs are difficulties in seeking financing from financial institutions due to lack of sufficient collateral, no credit history, irregular or uneasily verified sources of income.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in U. S. personal bankruptcy filings of {{the last fifteen years}} has focused attention on the wide disparities between different states ’ personal bankruptcy exemptions. These differences have been criticized both on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and also because they provide an incentive to move to a state with a higher exemption before declaring bankruptcy, that is to forum-shop. This paper focuses on the latter of these objections. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we estimate a Nested Logit model of the household migration decision. Our econometric approach specifically avoids the problem of endogenously induced bankruptcy filings by examining the effect of filing propensity, rather than the actual event of filing, on the tendency to migrate to a higher exemption state. We conclude that, while there is indeed evidence that considerations of bankruptcy laws do influence interstate migration, the actual effect is relatively modest. We estimate that, in any given year, roughly 17, 000 moves to higher-exemption states are motivated by considerations of differences in bankruptcy laws; by way of comparison, this is roughly comparable to the magnitude of recent estimates of welfare-induced migration. This suggests that the emphasis on differences in exemptions which has been a feature of recent attempts to reform the bankruptcy code is somewhat exaggerated...|$|E

Besides value or cost-effectiveness, the other principal aim in health care resource allocation should be equity among the population served.

On the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> {{innovation}} {{and dealing with}} market failure, writes Margaret Simons in The Content Makers I’D LIKE TO TURN to the perpetual debate, stoked most recently by Foxtel boss Kim Williams, about the place and future of taxpayer funded “broadcasters” {{in an age of}} media plenty. In his speech last week, Williams suggested that the ABC  should be funded only to do those things that the market cannot do – and that government funding for Australian content should be made available on a contestable basis, rather than simply given to the ABC and SBS. Williams’ model would see the ABC reduced, I think, to little more than Radio National and perhaps Four Corners. It would be a much tinier institution, and we all know that tiny institutions are easy to wipe out. All this, as I suggested in this post at the time, is part of a broader battle between media that asks users to pay at the point of use, (and can therefore afford to provide high quality content to comparitively small audiences)  and free to air media, both advertising funded and taxpayer funded. Given that the advertising funded free to air mass model is basically broken by audience fragmentation, the main free to air warrior is taxpayer funded “broadcasters”.

DESIGN [...] Cost minimisation study. SETTING [...] Primary health care in a remote community in Norway. SUBJECTS [...] A randomly selected sample (n = 597) of all patients (n = 1793) having radiological examinations in 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Annual direct medical costs, direct non-medical (travel) costs, and indirect costs (lost production) of the three options. RESULTS [...] After exclusion of costs common to the three systems the direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs of the three options were, respectively, 9000 pounds, 51, 000 pounds, and 31, 500 pounds (total 91, 500 pounds) for the existing system; 108, 000 pounds, 2, 000 pounds, and 13, 500 pounds (total 123, 500 pounds) for the teleradiology option; and 0 pounds, 75, 000 pounds, and 42, 000 pounds (117, 000 pounds in total) for the "all at host" option.

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of social security}} benefits rests on normative principles of social justice. Most strongly manifest in earnings-related social insurance, the principle of reciprocity has been increasingly questioned on <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> adequacy and fiscal viability, {{in the wake of}} socio-economic changes (e. g. post-industralisation, globalisation) and political developments (e. g. Europeanisation). Universalist programmes seem extraordinarily expensive under tight public budgets, and could be criticised as inequitable at a time when middle classes increasingly rely on individual and occupational forms of income security. The principle of need appears to have become more prominent within modern European social security systems keen on targeting resources. Is there empirical evidence which would reflect these alleged trends? Concentrating on three principles inherent in social security transfers (need, universalism and reciprocity) the major concerns of this article are conceptual and empirical. First, it addresses the problem of operationalising social security principles and delineating indicators of change over time. Second, it applies two of these indicators in order to identify and compare {{the extent to which the}} three principles have gained or lost prominence since the early 1980 s, with empirical evidence taken from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The article argues first that, applying either indicator, there is no cross-national trend towards squeezing reciprocity-based social insurance, but that a convergence between erstwhile strong (Bismarckian) and weak (Beveridgean) principled programmes can be identified. Second, a clear trend towards needs-based social security can be identified within the ¿legal¿ but not within the ¿volume¿ perspective, at least in some programmes and some claimant groups. This is due to both policy changes and favourable labour market conditions. Third, two countries indicate very diverse trends. British social security is distinctive in terms of the erosion of Beveridgean reciprocity, as well as the growing strength of the needs principle. In the Netherlands, there have been considerable shifts in principles underlying certain programmes, but no general trend in either direction can be observed. On the whole, Dutch social security continues to exhibit a strong mix of principles. ...|$|E
