25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
2500|$|Woodruff had {{organised}} for {{his band}} {{to work with}} Chapman and Kevin [...] "Caveman" [...] Shirley (audio engineer): [...] "I had never met , <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> work. I'd listened to everything he'd ever done... I thought 'if we can drag [...] him out of retirement to get the song structure right'... Susie was writing great songs and great sentiments, but the structure wasn't quite there. I thought if I can then convince him {{to work with a}} young rude engineer, {{which turned out to be}} , and you couldn't get much younger or ruder than that, then I'm going to end up with a record that has an edge to it, that has some tone to it, that has some rock and roll and that has some feel to it that's as edgy as she is but with great songs." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not to}} be concealed, nor was it so {{doubtful}} as {{to leave}} me any room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire husband. I was frightened to death; I never was in such a consternation in my life; I though I should have sunk into the ground; my blood ran chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of ague. I say, there was no room to question the truth of it; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> clothes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> horse, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
60|$|It is over now. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> strength, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> weakness. What {{passed between}} us I shall put down to-morrow. To-night I am weary.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> name, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> note, [...] That so with rapture {{takes my}} soul; [...] Like flame the gold beneath his throat, [...] His glossy cope is black as coal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said St. Just, {{and much}} {{against his will}} a slight shudder ran through his slim figure as he spoke. [...] "Foucquier-Tinville <b>I</b> know; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> cunning, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> power--but the other?" ...|$|R
60|$|This was translated, and {{the lawyer}} asked how <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> trade.|$|E
60|$|Ald. Woodall of Woodall; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> father; we were contemporaries, and fellow-wenchers in our youth.|$|E
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of Moissan, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> artificial diamonds were very small. I shook my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} such a lark. Two or three times I {{have been to the}} 'Hollies'; to socialist meetings. Leslie does not know. They are great fun. Of course, I am in sympathy with the socialists, but I cannot narrow my eyes till I see one thing only. Life is like a large, rather {{beautiful}} man who is young and full of vigour, but hairy, barbaric, with hands hard and dirty, the dirt ingrained. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> hands are very ugly, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> mouth is not firmly shapen, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> limbs are hairy and brutal: but his eyes are deep and very beautiful. That is what I tell George.|$|R
60|$|Aur. I'll proceed no farther, if Benito goes: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> folly {{will produce}} some mischief.|$|R
60|$|O monstrous thief! To {{quote the}} words of Shakespeare as your own. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's that mad?" [...] queried Mrs. Dennant {{from behind}} the urn--"Tom Crocker? Ah, yes! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> mother; she was a Springer." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Oh, I hope not, dear. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> mother quite well. She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland's daughters ...|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>his</b> hand might be stained with blood.|$|E
60|$|Const. Let him go, {{and take}} no notice of him: Poor rogue! he little thinks <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> poverty.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. As if {{anything}} could demoralise Robert Chiltern! You seem {{to forget that}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> real character.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stupid! You know Wild Water. When he sees I'm languishing for eggs, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> {{mind like}} a book, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to languish, {{what will he}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "(Third.) That I {{entrapped}} {{your son}} Fritz into asking for my daughter's hand in marriage, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> father to be a rich man.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is implied," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, [...] "that I allowed Mr. Peacocke to preach in my church after <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> {{marriage}} was informal." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{look about}} him, {{added to his}} tone and manner, set me strong against him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> father had not been of this stamp.|$|E
6000|$|DAISY. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> obstinacy. When he's {{once made}} up his mind--[Contemptuously.]--he prides himself on his firmness. Oh, what shall I do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know whether}} it was the Great Western or the South Eastern,' {{continued}} Colonel Brace; 'but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> leg is broken.' ...|$|R
60|$|Elv. [Rising.] I {{have read}} the note, father, and will send him an answer immediately; for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> lodgings by his letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is Ravoninohitriniony! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> knock. He is come!" [...] exclaimed a girlish voice, {{as a pair}} of {{arms were}} seen dimly to {{encircle}} the guide's neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I not?" [...] he {{answered}} politely, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> hand was groping in the darkness, so I put out mine {{and he held}} on tightly to one finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} grocer, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> features. He takes after his mother's family; {{she was a}} Dodson. He's a fine, {{straight}} youth; what's he been brought up to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not so easily,' {{returned}} Miss Wren. 'He wouldn't blow up alone. He'd {{carry me}} up with him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> tricks and his manners.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>'is</b> name--at {{least part}} of it; an' the 'abitation of 'is wife, or sweet-'eart, or sister, or suthin' o' that sort?" ...|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [Scanning her not unprosperous figure] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> {{relations}} aren't very forthy about him. Perhaps you can {{do something}} for him, till he finds his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not accountable," [...] Flora replied. [...] "I {{wanted you}} to approve, but I meant to marry Harry. I loved him, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> drawbacks. But this doesn't matter; I love him now." ...|$|E
60|$|His vehemence {{made any}} words I could say sound weak {{before they were}} uttered. What {{argument}} could I show stronger than that he had already put before himself? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> answer to everything I could urge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop that croaking, you white-headed crow," [...] I said, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> {{words were}} true. What chance had a laager of ten waggons all told against {{at least two}} {{thousand}} of the bravest savages in the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! I {{dare say}} {{he wanted to}} get home to write poetry, as you did not praise what he had written. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> vanity and flightiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is that?" [...] {{he asked}} one of his acquaintances; [...] "methinks <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> face, though it passes my memory to say where I have seen it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The East? Him? Why, {{he comes}} from a farm right up north here, just this side of Jefferson. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> father slightly--Adolph Valborg--typical cranky old Swede farmer." ...|$|R
