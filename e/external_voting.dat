30|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> in labour sending countries is commonly {{viewed as a}} way to foster migrants’ remittances, which frequently represent a major source of foreign currencies. However, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> is not confined to labour-sending countries and no correlation has been found between the {{adoption of}} <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> and the share of remittances in the GDP or the relative size of the population abroad (Collyer & Vathi, 2007). Although the economic dependency on migration does not seem to explain the diffusion of <b>external</b> <b>voting,</b> integration in the global economy is typically one of the arguments in favour of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> (Lafleur, 2013).|$|E
30|$|This paper first {{argues that}} the {{literature}} on <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> should {{pay more attention to}} the political context in which <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> provisions are adopted. Rather than focusing primarily on why States adopt <b>external</b> <b>voting,</b> more research studies should explore if and how <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> provisions are part of broader domestic processes of political change (authoritarian succession, regime consolidation, democratic transition). In addition, this paper calls for more research on the condition of implementation of <b>external</b> <b>voting.</b> More specifically, it suggests that the impact of voting procedures on the voter turnout is amplified in external elections due to the specific conditions under which the vote takes place.|$|E
30|$|The {{literature}} on <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> first includes normative political theory, which discusses if and under which conditions citizens abroad should {{be entitled to}} vote. Opponents to <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> usually point at the threat to national sovereignty, in particular when diaspora outnumbers domestic population; {{the high costs of}} organizing elections abroad; and the greater risks of fraud (Lopez-Guerra, 2005; Rubio-Marin, 2006). In contrast, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> supporters claim that voting rights should be granted to all citizens independently of their place of residence. Bauböck (2007) further argues that the diffusion of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> actually illustrates the transformations of the concept of citizenship in the age of globalization. He considers that <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> echoes the extension of the franchise to foreign residents (usually in local elections) as both call into question the republican conception of citizenship according to which membership in the political community and permanent residency in the country are both required to be entitled to vote.|$|E

5000|$|Transnational {{citizenship}} redefines traditional {{notions of}} citizenship and replaces an individual's singular national loyalties {{with the ability to}} belong to multiple nation states, as made visible in the political, cultural, social and economic realms. Unlike national citizenship, where individuals interact in such capacities with one sovereign state, transnational citizenship transcends pre-established territorial boundaries {{in order to create a}} modern meaning of [...] "belonging" [...] in an increasingly globalized society. Additionally, while preconceived notions of citizenship are often divided between national, social and individual forms of identity, all three categories serve to contribute to the meaning of transnational citizenship. State citizenship can be defined as an individual establishing their sense of belonging by espousing to the liberal-democratic values of the state in the public sphere. When applied to transnational citizenship, an individual would have the opportunity to be civically engaged in multiple societies. A Dominican politician who lives in Santo Domingo yet canvasses in a highly dense Dominican American population in Boston, Massachusetts for <b>external</b> <b>votes</b> is an example of a transnational citizens functioning politically between two states.|$|R

30|$|To sum up, the {{developing}} literature on <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> first suggests to exploring how the worldwide diffusion of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> articulates to domestic political processes.

40|$|This article tackles the {{question}} of transnational electoral participation resulting from emigration. Drawing on several strands of political science literature, the theoretical section explains why emigration {{is likely to be}} detrimental to migrants’ voting rates, which specific factors may affect these rates’ variation and, overall, when and how emigration impacts nationwide voter turnout. The theory is then tested using original datasets on emigration, legal provisions for <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> and <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> rates in 10 Central and East European postcommunist democracies (CEE- 10). The results confirm that <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> rates are much lower than domestic ones and reveal that their cross-national and over-time variation can be, to a large extent, explained by legal provisions for <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> and diaspora size. As a corollary of the weak transnational participation, emigration accounts for approximately one tenth of the fall in voter turnout that has occurred in the CEE- 10 since the early 1990 s...|$|E
30|$|Another {{reason that}} {{commonly}} explains {{the diffusion of}} <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> is the growing claims for voting rights from migrants’ organizations, in particular in context of democratic transition (Rhodes & Harutyunyan, 2010). However, the influence of migrants’ organizations, some of which barely consist in “four guys and a fax machine” (Rowe, 2001), should not be overestimated. More importantly, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> {{is not confined to}} democracies, as shown by several examples, including Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia in the 1970 s and 1980 s (Brand, 2010). Overall, the adoption of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> provisions appears to be inseparable from broader domestic political processes, from competition between political parties to institutional reforms (e.g. electoral or constitutional reform, regionalization, etc.) (Lafleur, 2015).|$|E
40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{the findings from}} a research project that examined the voting patterns among Colombian migrants living in the UK (London) and Spain (Madrid) {{in relation to the}} Colombian Congressional and Presidential elections of 2010. This forms the European component of a larger comparative study with colleagues in the US, Colombia and France. The project aimed to identify the motivations behind migrants’ participation in home country elections, as well as the barriers to the exercise of the <b>external</b> <b>vote.</b> It also aimed to examine how and why experiences of voting differ across different countries. It was set within the wider context of how governments of the home countries of migrants have increasingly extended political rights to their country people residing abroad, especially in Latin America. While some fear that maintaining strong political ties with countries of origin is detrimental to the political engagement of migrants in destinations, others have highlighted how migrants participate in both countries simultaneously. Although there has been increasing recognition that transnationalism and integration are not mutually exclusive, much of this theorising is in its infancy. Empirically, this project has examined a fairly neglected ‘new migrant group’ in Europe focusing on Colombian migrants in the UK and Spain (see also McIlwaine et al., 2011). The Colombian case is especially important as the state has pioneered the extension of political rights to expatriates living abroad giving them the right to vote in congressional elections and choose a representative from the diaspora (the first in Latin America).

40|$|Middleware is a {{class of}} {{software}} systems above the operating system which is becoming widely used for programming distributed systems. Voting is a fundamental operation when distributed systems involve replicated components. However, support for voting in middleware is very limited. This paper describes issues involved with supporting voting, and more general data fusion, in middleware. We describe the Voting Virtual Machine (VVM) architecture, which can be embedded in different middleware substrates such as. NET and CORBA. We also describe its companion Voting Definition Language (VDL), which allows for portable description of voting algorithms. The VVM and VDL, together with the <b>external</b> VVM <b>voting</b> manager, provide for voting transparency and adaptive voting.

40|$|In this article, I {{start by}} looking at the {{historical}} origin of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> in an attempt to define the practice as a set of administrative procedures. However, looking at its speedy global development, I argue that <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> is taking a different meaning for both sending and receiving societies in the era of globalization. Drawing on different examples from Europe, Latin America and Africa, and comparing the early development of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> legislations with contemporary processes that lead to the enfranchisement of citizens abroad, I argue that the enfranchisement of citizens abroad is now part of a larger state strategy of developing external citizenship in order to capture what some scholars call the “diaspora resource”. For receiving states, I show through two case studies that the development of foreign electoral campaigns on their territory still triggers classic Westphalian fears of dual loyalties of immigrants. Nonetheless, I show that under specific circumstances, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> can also be perceived by receiving states an opportunity to capture the votes of citizens enfranchised in both the sending and receiving societies...|$|E
30|$|Finally, on {{the issue}} of {{political}} rights, Turkey was not able to implement effective <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> due to several legal and practical impediments, despite the willingness of the government for a while (Kadirbeyoglu, 2012). Instead, a modest version of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> has been in place in the Turkish electoral system {{for quite a long time}} in the form of placing ballot boxes in the border zones during 70 days before elections. Notwithstanding the transition to <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> since 2014 presidential elections, it can be safely argued that Turkey did not deny voting rights to emigrants on the basis of residence requirements. Therefore, single or dual, Turkish emigrant citizens cannot be seen as quasi-citizens insofar as they hold the legal status which also entails the opportunity to exercise political rights.|$|E
30|$|The {{literature}} on <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> eventually includes research studies that apply electoral sociology methods {{to understand the}} patterns and dynamics of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> behaviour. The results suggest that political preferences among the electors abroad are strongly shaped prior departure, rather than resulting from their experience abroad. Lafleur and Sanchez Dominguez (2016), who look at <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> among Bolivians in South America, North America, and Europe, conclude that the migration experiences influences {{to a certain extent}} perceptions of homeland politics, but that political preferences are mostly shaped prior to departure. 1 Similarly, Ahmadov and Sasse (2015) find that political preferences among Ukrainians and Poles abroad are strongly predicted by their regional background. Eventually, Dedieu, Chauvet, Gubert, Mesplé-Somps, and Smith (2013) argue that the political landscape of the Senegalese diaspora reflect the homeland’s political and ethnic divisions.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{focused on}} {{emigrant}} special representation are scarce {{within the literature}} of political transnationalism. In general, scholars have treated this topic as an appendix to research about <b>external</b> active <b>voting.</b> However, {{it is possible to}} find some exceptions to this trend. Lafleur (2013) inquired into the mechanisms of special representation implemented in Italy. As he stated, there are reasonable doubts about the capacity of external parliamentarians to substantively represent the heterogeneity of emigrant interests (p. 137). He argued that two things can prevent substantive representation of emigrants: party and ideological alliances (when party interests are prioritized over the interests of the emigrant constituency), and the competition between representatives with the same external constituency (pp. 137 – 138). In a recent study, Østergaard-Nielsen and Ciornei (2017) explained why the political parties of four European democracies pay attention to emigrants. In their analysis, the special representation of emigrants was an explanatory variable. They concluded that the introduction of emigrant special representation {{had a significant impact on}} emigration salience in party agendas (p. 23). Interestingly, they also discovered that the closeness of party competition increased the effect of special representation. However, they recognized that a study focused on parties and not individuals cannot fully explain the differences across emigration salience in different countries and at different points in time. As they put it “the extent to which and why emigrant representatives ‘take over’ the issue of emigration is worthy of further investigation” (p. 8).|$|R
40|$|The use of {{independent}} committees for {{the setting of}} interest rates, such as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, is quickly becoming the norm in developed economies. In this paper we examine the issue of appointing external members (members who are outside {{the staff of the}} central bank) to these committees. We construct a model of MPC voting behaviour, and show that members who begin voting for similar interest rates should not systematically diverge from each other at any future point. However, econometric results in fact show that <b>external</b> members initially <b>vote</b> in line with internal members, but after a year, begin voting for substantially lower interest rates. The robustness of this effect to including member fixed effects provides strong evidence that externals behave differently from internals because of institutional differences between the groups, and not some unobserved heterogeneity. We then examine whether career concerns can explain these findings, and conclude that they cannot. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), Bank of England, Committee Voting,Signalling...|$|R

40|$|Today, a large {{majority}} of states allow at least some of their emigrants to take part in home country elections from abroad. This article first looks at the diffusion of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> laws and shows that over the past 25 years they have become widely-adopted and are no longer limited to specific professional categories of citizens. Second, the article explains the international diffusion of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> by discussing the “norm- internationalization hypothesis” and the “electoral-competition hypothesis. ” Third, the article attempts to demonstrate that these hypotheses cannot explain why, in a democratic context, states continue to implement a series of hurdles that deter emigrants from using their newly gained rights. Looking at recent developments in Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa, it concludes that the diffusion and variations of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> laws result from transnational negotiation processes in a context of democratic transformation among various actors whose interests are strongly affected by the inclusion or exclusion of these new voters.

40|$|Commercial {{digital signal}} {{processors}} (DSPs) {{for use in}} high-speed satellite computers are challenged by the damaging effects of space radiation, mainly single event upsets (SEUs) and single event functional interrupts (SEFIs). Innovations {{have been developed for}} mitigating the effects of SEUs and SEFIs, enabling the use of very-highspeed commercial DSPs with improved SEU tolerances. Time-triple modular redundancy (TTMR) is a method of applying traditional triple modular redundancy on a single processor, exploiting the VLIW (very long instruction word) class of parallel processors. TTMR improves SEU rates substantially. SEFIs are solved by a SEFI-hardened core circuit, external to the microprocessor. It monitors the health of the processor, and if a SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return to performance through a series of escalating events. TTMR and hardened-core solutions were developed for both DSPs and reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This includes advancement of TTMR algorithms for DSPs and reconfigurable FPGAs, plus a rad-hard, hardened-core integrated circuit that services both the DSP and FPGA. Additionally, a combined DSP and FPGA board architecture was fully developed into a rad-hard engineering product. This technology enables use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DSPs in computers for satellite and other space applications, allowing rapid deployment at a much lower cost. Traditional rad-hard space computers are very expensive and typically have long lead times. These computers are either based on traditional rad-hard processors, which have extremely low computational performance, or triple modular redundant (TMR) FPGA arrays, which suffer from power and complexity issues. Even more frustrating is that the TMR arrays of FPGAs require a fixed, <b>external</b> rad-hard <b>voting</b> element, thereby causing them to lose much of their reconfiguration capability and in some cases significant speed reduction. The benefits of COTS high-performance signal processing include significant increase in onboard science data processing, enabling orders of magnitude reduction in required communication bandwidth for science data return, orders of magnitude improvement in onboard mission planning and critical decision making, and the ability to rapidly respond to changing mission environments, thus enabling opportunistic science and orders of magnitude reduction in the cost of mission operations through reduction of required staff. Additional benefits of COTS-based, high-performance signal processing include the ability to leverage considerable commercial and academic investments in advanced computing tools, techniques, and infra structure, and the familiarity of the science and IT community with these computing environments...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: A major {{question}} that has puzzled political scientists is what factors influence the decisions of US Supreme Court justices. Despite 20 th Century statutory reforms {{that have led to}} a fundamental weakening of institutional cohesion on the Supreme Court, the norm of stare decisis continues to serve as a constraint to moderate decision-makers under certain <b>external</b> conditions. Evaluate <b>voting</b> behavior on the Rehnquist Court to discover which justices are indeed demonstrating moderate behavior. Approach: This research makes a unique contribution by expanding the US Supreme Court Justice-Centered Rehnquist Database (1986 - 2000) to include two new variables to measure the level of salience in each case. Therefore, allowing researchers to better access the impact of issue salience in closely divided precedent-setting cases. Both the New York Times and Congressional Quarterly indicators are used to gauge case salience. The analysis focuses on the existing academic and law review literature on the role of precedent and issue salience which may place constraints on the Court. The jurisprudential styles of Justices OConnor, Kennedy, Souter, and White are analyzed to ascertain similar moderate behavior traits. Since the data is binary, the logistic regression method is applied within the parameters of the moderate judicial model to illuminate the degree of moderate behavior. Results: The findings reveal that Justice Kennedy does not neatly fit the moderate judicial model. Instead, OConnor was the only justice that consistently demonstrated moderate voting behavior. Interestingly, only Justice White was more likely to maintain precedent in cases that were both salient and closely divided. Conclusion: This work helps close the glaring gap in the prevailing literature by developing a political model which predicts the conditions in which moderate justices are likely to uphold or not uphold precedent. In addition, it provides a more accurate assessment of the current relevance of the norm of stare decisis to the Legal Model...|$|R
40|$|To save {{resources}} {{and build on}} private expertise, federal agencies have incorporated privately drafted standards into thousands of federal regulations — but only by “reference. ” These standards range widely, subsuming safety, benefits, and testing standards. An individual who seeks access to this binding law generally cannot freely read it online or in a governmental depository library, as she can the U. S. Code or the Code of Federal Regulations. Instead, she generally must pay a significant fee to the drafting organization, or else she must travel to Washington, D. C., to the Office of the Federal Register’s reading room. This law, under largely private control, is not formally “secret,” but it is expensive and difficult to find. It {{raises the question of}} what underlies the intuition that law, in a democracy, needs to be readily, publicly available. Previous analyses of the need for publicity have focused almost wholly on the need of regulated entities for notice of their obligations. This Article assesses several other considerations, including notice to regulatory beneficiaries, such as Medicare recipients, consumers of dangerous products, and neighbors of natural gas pipelines. Ready public access to the law is also critical to ensuring that federal agencies are meaningfully accountable for their decisions, through both internal and <b>external</b> mechanisms, including <b>voting,</b> political oversight, and agency procedures. The need for ready public access is at least as strong in this collaborative governance setting as when agencies act alone. Finally, expressive harm — a message inconsistent with core democratic values — is likely to flow from governmental adoption of regulatory law that is, in contrast to American law in general, harder to find and costly to access. Full assessment of the importance of public access to law both strengthens the case for reform of access barriers to incorporated-by-reference rules and limits the range of acceptable reform measures...|$|R

30|$|Three {{main reasons}} justify {{the choice of}} Tunisia as a case study. First, the {{adoption}} of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> {{is the result of}} a mixed process of political liberalization and authoritarian consolidation. <b>External</b> <b>voting</b> was first adopted in 1988 by Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, one year after his coup against Habib Bourguiba, and was subsequently implanted in 1989 in a context of political liberalization. However, elections that followed the authoritarian turn of his regime in the early 1990 s were characterized by massive frauds. Then, after the 2011 Uprising, the transitional authority in charge of leading the country “from the revolution to the election” gave a new impetus to <b>external</b> <b>voting.</b> Tunisia now allows direct parliamentary representation for its citizens abroad (as only thirteen other countries worldwide) and provides a number of overseas representatives that is proportionate to the (estimated) number of Tunisians abroad, which is unique in the world (Collyer, 2014). Third, the voter turnout among the Tunisians abroad is relatively important since 2011, especially in regard with the low voter turnout that characterizes external elections worldwide (International IDEA, 2007).|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{composition}} and function of boards of social enterprises. A social enterprise {{can be defined as}} a company, which is founded by users or external stakeholder in order to create jobs (or a work place), a meaning in live or to further integration. One tries to achieve this goal by a business activity and/or subsidies and/or neighbourhood projects. The amount of social enterprises grew steadily after the restructuring of social welfare in Sweden since the 1980. Alternative forms of welfare – such as a social enterprise – will probably grow further in importance. Thus, certain questions arise: Who controls such companies? How and by whom are these companies managed? How can social enterprises survive in an uncertain and fast changing environment? Most Swedish social enterprises take the incorporation form of a social co-operative (ekonomisk förening). They have as such a mandatory board, democratically elected by their members at the annual general meeting. I used two contrary scientific theories, which try to answer the question: “What is a board there for?” One answer was that a board is there for the company and acts as an important instrument for the acquisition of resources, for the strategic development of the company and for the company’s contacts and representation to the outside (resource-mobilization-theory). The second answer was that a board is the most important instrument for the owner or stakeholder to control the company and/or to participate in it (principal-agent-theory/multi-stakeholder-theory). Both theories suggest a board composed of different stakeholders and the enterprises own representatives (such as members and CEO). Those stakeholders want either to increase their insight and influence in the enterprise, or the enterprises’ management understood the possible value added, which could be achieved by including active external stakeholders into the work of the board. Using a European study (PERSE-project) as a base I interviewed all 15 Swedish social enterprises which participated in the study. The analysis led to the finding that 9 of 15 companies (60 %) do not have <b>external</b> stakeholders with <b>voting</b> power in their boards. Only members of the co-operative could become a board member with voting rights. Board meetings are seen as an unpleasant formality. I call such a board composition “classical co-operative”. External stakeholders do not participate in the company and the company does not actively use of the board as an instrument. Only 6 of the 15 social enterprises (40 %) have a board composition which I call “internal-external” and which is consistent with the above theories. Such a structure combines internal board members (members of the co-operation, management) with external stakeholders - either as board members with voting rights or as adjunct board members. I was unable to answer the starting question (”what is a board there for”) in those 6 cases. It remains unclear if the board is used as an active instrument in gaining resources (board is there for the company) or if it is there for to represent external stakeholders and to safeguard there interests. There might be a possible connection between the founders of a social enterprise and the board composition. A significant number of companies founded by users chose a classical co-operative board...|$|R
30|$|The paper first {{explores the}} {{adoption}} of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> provisions by the former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali as soon as 1988, and the extension of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> rights after the 2011 Uprising. The paper further adopts a geographic, diachronic, and multi-level approach to analyse the voter turnout and the voting behaviour among the Tunisians abroad since 2011. Results first show that the adoption and implementation of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> in Tunisia is closely articulated to domestic processes of political change, regardless {{of the type of}} regime (authoritarian or democratic). Furthermore, results show that the voting behaviour of the Tunisians abroad follows the same trends than their Tunisian counterparts, but that it varies significantly depending on their place of residence (country, city, and neighbourhood). Such observation challenges the idea according to which migrants socialised with liberal values in Western societies tend to promote such values in their homeland. In contrast, this paper argues that the voter turnout and the voting behaviour in external elections depend on pre-migration variables and on the local context in which migrants are embedded.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, sending states have greatly {{increased}} their interest in maintaining strong connections with their citizens abroad. The worldwide adoption of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> – understood not only as an electoral procedure that allows some citizens to cast their vote outside the national territory but also as an acknowledgement that an emigrant status is compatible with polity membership – illustrates this phenomenon. Why do states enfranchise citizens abroad? In this article, I seek {{to answer this question}} by comparing the evolution of the debates on the extension of voting privileges to citizens residing abroad in Mexico, Italy and Belgium. My central argument is that a combination of variables shapes the develop- ment of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> {{in different parts of the}} world, as well as the content of these laws. These include emigrant lobbying, home states ’ desires to stimulate emigrant loyalty for economic purposes and, most importantly, the evolution of domestic politics.

30|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> has gained growing {{attention}} among scholars, in particular within transnational studies, {{as the number}} of countries that have granted voting rights to their citizens abroad soared from 31 in 1991 to about 120 in 2010 (Lafleur, 2013).|$|E

30|$|Domestic {{politics}} also {{matter when}} it comes to understand the heterogeneous forms of implementation of <b>external</b> <b>voting.</b> Voting procedures and voting systems vary greatly from one country to another (Collyer, 2014; International IDEA, 2007; Lafleur, 2013). For example, <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> can be restricted depending one the country of residence or the length of stay abroad. Moreover, practicalities to cast a ballot (postal/electronic voting, voting in person abroad) may deter electoral participation if associated with very high “costs” (e.g.: long journey to the nearest polling station, tortuous administrative procedures). Finally, how ballots are counted (in domestic or in overseas constituencies) has a great impact on the potential to influence electoral outcomes. To sum up, genuine political participation and representation for the citizens abroad largely depend on the voting procedures and the voting system.|$|E
30|$|The {{theoretical}} {{starting point}} {{of this paper is}} located at the intersection of two strands of literature that so far have not been sufficiently linked. On the one hand, there is a vast literature that studies the effect of quotas and the reservation of seats on the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the legislative process (Htun, 2016; Reynolds, 2005). For example, scholars have studied the representation of indigenous populations (Crisp, Demirkaya, & Millian, 2014), women (Lovenduski & Norris, 2003; Mansbridge, 1999; Schwindt-Bayer, 2010), ethnic minorities (Hänni, 2016; Htun, 2016; Minta, 2009; Rouse, 2013) and immigrants in states of reception (Bird, Saalfeld, & Wust, 2010; Saalfeld, 2011). To my knowledge, however, scholars working on political representation have not applied its methodologies nor theoretical framework to the analysis of emigrant political representation. This paper intends to fill this gap in the literature. On the other hand, migration scholars concerned with <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> have investigated the specificities and commonalities of external electoral systems (Escobar, 2007), emigrant voting behavior (Burgess, 2014; Lafleur & Sánchez-Domínguez, 2014) and the normative implications of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> rights (Bauböck, 2009; Rubio-Marin, 2006). However, it appears that the literature of <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> has suffered from a bias towards the analysis of active external rights, leaving, with some exceptions (Collard, 2013; Collyer, 2014; Østergaard-Nielsen & Ciornei, 2017), emigrant passive electoral rights under-researched.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of last two decades, Mexico’s {{policies}} towards its population abroad has moved from a situation characterized by {{a general lack of}} interest to being one of the most active state in this field. The recent development of dual national and <b>external</b> <b>voting</b> policies as well as the creation of a dedicated government agency and of a consultative body all epitomize the radical change through which Mexico has gone. In this chapter, I argue that the transformation of Mexico’s attitude towards its emigrants is strongly connected to the evolution of its political regime characterized by a transition towards democracy, a strong desire to take part actively in the global economy and the increasing interest of regional actors in migration issues. Focusing on the issue of <b>external</b> <b>voting,</b> the chapter concludes by discussing the evolution of the power relations between the emigrant community and the Mexican state.
