500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more...</b> Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, groups {{opposed to}} {{abortion}} saw [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] as a positive, pro-life song. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, {{the president of}} the California chapter of Feminists for Life (FFL) in the US, said that [...] "abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative." [...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others applauded Obama's {{call for}} a {{national}} dialogue on race, but hoped that words would be translated into action.

60|$|Two {{or three}} days had passed before the Christians began to {{feel at home in}} the ancient seat of Mahommedan power.

As there <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> and more land, more and more of the animals left the water, until finally most of them were spending nearly all of the time on land. Now Old Mother Nature had been keeping a sharp watch, as she always does, and when she found that they were foolish enough to like the land best, she did all that she could to make things comfortable for them. She taught them how to run and jump and climb and dig, according to which things they liked best to do, so that it wasn't very long before a lot of them forgot that they ever had lived in the water, and they began to look down on those who still lived in the water, and to put on airs and hold their heads very high.|$|E
6000|$|The islets {{were found}} deserted and tenantless. Not {{a human being}} had entered the house since Rose left it, the evening she had {{remained}} so long ashore, in company with her aunt and the Señor Montefalderon. This our heroine knew from the circumstance of finding a slight fastening of the outer door in the precise situation {{in which she had}} left it with her own hands. At first a feeling of oppression and awe prevailed with both Harry and Rose, when they recollected the fate of those who had so lately been tenants of the place; but this gradually wore off, and each soon <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> at home. As for Jack, he very coolly rummaged the lockers, as he called the drawers and closets of the place, and made his preparations for cooking a very delicious repast, in which callipash and callipee were to be material ingredients. The necessary condiments were easily enough found in that place, turtle being a common dish there, and it was not long before steams that might have quickened the appetite of an alderman filled the kitchen. Rose rummaged, too, and found a clean table-cloth, plates, glasses, bowls, spoons, and knives; in a word, all that was necessary to spread a plain but plentiful board. While all this was doing, Harry took some fishing-tackle, and proceeded to a favourable spot among the rocks. In twenty minutes he returned with a fine mess of that most delicious little fish that goes by the very unpoetical name of [...] "hog-fish," [...] from the circumstance of its giving a grunt not unlike that of a living porker, when rudely drawn from its proper element. Nothing was now wanting to not only a comfortable, but to what was really a most epicurian meal, and Jack just begged the lovers to have patience for an hour or so, when he promised them dishes that even New York could not furnish.|$|E

6000|$|I {{belong in}} Cleveland, Ohio. One winter's night, two years ago, I reached home just after dark, in a driving snow-storm, {{and the first}} thing I heard when I entered the house was that my dearest boyhood friend and schoolmate, John B. Hackett, had died the day before, and that his last {{utterance}} had been a desire that I would take his remains home to his poor old father and mother in Wisconsin. I was greatly shocked and grieved, but {{there was no time to}} waste in emotions; I must start at once. I took the card, marked [...] "Deacon Levi Hackett, Bethlehem, Wisconsin," [...] and hurried off through the whistling storm to the railway station. Arrived there I found the long white-pine box which had been described to me; I fastened the card to it with some tacks, saw it put safely aboard the express car, and then ran into the eating-room to provide myself with a sandwich and some cigars. When I returned, presently, there was my coffin-box back again, apparently, and a young fellow examining around it, with a card in his hands, and some tacks and a hammer! I was astonished and puzzled. He began to nail on his card, and I rushed out to the express car, in a good deal of a state of mind, to ask for an explanation. But no--there was my box, all right, in the express car; it hadn't been disturbed. [The fact is that without my suspecting it a prodigious mistake had been made. I was carrying off a box of guns which that young fellow had come to the station to ship to a rifle company in Peoria, Illinois, and he had got my corpse!] Just then the conductor sung out [...] "All aboard," [...] and I jumped into the express car and got a comfortable seat on a bale of buckets. The expressman was there, hard at work,--a plain man of fifty, with a simple, honest, good-natured face, and a breezy, practical heartiness in his general style. As the train moved off a stranger skipped into the car and set a package of peculiarly mature and capable Limburger cheese on one end of my coffin-box--I mean my box of guns. That is to say, I know now that it was Limburger cheese, but at that time I never had heard of the article in my life, and of course was wholly ignorant of its character. Well, we sped through the wild night, the bitter storm raged on, a cheerless misery stole over me, my heart went down, down, down! The old expressman made a brisk remark or two about the tempest and the arctic weather, slammed his sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his window down tight, and then went bustling around, here and there and yonder, setting things to rights, and all the time contentedly humming [...] "Sweet By and By," [...] in a low tone, and flatting a good deal. Presently I began to detect a most evil and searching odor stealing about on the frozen air. This depressed my spirits still more, because of course I attributed it to my poor departed friend. There was something infinitely saddening about his calling himself to my remembrance in this dumb pathetic way, so it was hard to keep the tears back. Moreover, it distressed me on account of the old expressman, who, I was afraid, might notice it. However, he went humming tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this I was grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy; and soon I began to feel more and more uneasy every minute, for every minute that went by that odor thickened up the more, and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> and more gamey and hard to stand. Presently, having got things arranged to his satisfaction, the expressman got some wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove.|$|E

40|$|When {{we present}} {{geometrical}} problems under various conditions, {{we can expect}} different results of their solving. In this paper we studied to see what differences we could get under the conditions, whether we gave the problems with their conclusions, or we gave ones without them, whether we presented the solution after each trial, or we made subjects try to solve them continuously. PROCESS Our subjects were the students of the middle school and the high school. We devided them into four groups, and made two of them solve the problems with their conclutions, two of them, ones without the conclusions, and made another pair of them after its preceeding one's solution, and the rest pair, solve the problems continuously. RESULT When we presented geometrical problems, we {{could see that the}} stimulus given in the process of the solution had considerably great influence on failures, but it influenced very little on the successful students. In other words, a great factor in the next process of solution could not be gained from the stimulus, but from the fact whether they succeeded or not. When we presented problems continuously without any stimulus in their processes, solvers gave us the same tendency of solution to the continuous problems. The <b>more</b> complex problems <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> the <b>more</b> effective the giving of the solution after trials would be.

[...] The others arrested themselves in various attitudes of attention, and remained listening to Lapham with an interest that profoundly flattered him. Now, at last, he felt that he was holding up his end of the rope. [...] "I can't say he went into the thing from the highest motives, altogether; our motives are always pretty badly mixed, and when there's such a hurrah-boys as there was then, you can't tell which is which. I suppose Jim Millon's wife <b>was</b> enough <b>to</b> account for his going, herself. She was a pretty bad assortment," [...] said Lapham, lowering his voice and glancing round at the door to make sure that it was shut, [...] "and she used to lead Jim ONE kind of life. Well, sir," [...] continued Lapham, synthetising his auditors in that form of address, [...] "that fellow used to save every cent of his pay and send it to that woman. Used to get me to do it for him. I tried to stop him. 'Why, Jim,' said I, 'you know what she'll do with it.' 'That's so, Cap,' says he, 'but I don't know what she'll do without it.' And it did keep her straight--straight as a string--as long as Jim lasted. Seemed as if there was something mysterious about it. They had a little girl,--about as old as my oldest girl,--and Jim used to talk to me about her. Guess he done it as much for her as for the mother; and he said to me before the last action we went into, 'I should like to turn tail and run, Cap. I ain't comin' out o' this one. But I don't suppose it would do.' 'Well, not for you, Jim,' said I. 'I want to live,' he says; and he bust out crying right there in my tent. 'I want to live for poor Molly and Zerrilla'--that's what they called the little one; I dunno where they got the name. 'I ain't ever had half a chance; and now she's doing better, and I believe we should get along after this.' He set there cryin' like a baby. But he wa'n't no baby when he went into action. I hated to look at him after it was over, not so much because he'd got a ball that was meant for me by a sharpshooter--he saw the devil takin' aim, and he jumped to warn me--as because he didn't look like Jim; he looked like--fun; all desperate and savage. I guess he died hard." ...|$|R
