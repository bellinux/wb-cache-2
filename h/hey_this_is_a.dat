500|$|The {{visual effects}} were {{cited as the}} central {{highlight}} of the film.

To Nick de Semlyen of Empire, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> movie of astonishing high-end gloss, fused to a pounding Daft Punk soundtrack, populated with sleek sirens and chiselled hunks, boasting electroluminescent landscapes to make Blu-ray players weep." [...] Some critics were not as impressed with the film's special effects.

Though declaring that Tron: Legacy was [...] "eye-popping", San Francisco Chronicle Amy Biancolli asserted that the special effects were [...] "spectacular"—albeit cheesy. A columnist for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern denounced the producers' emphasis on technological advancements, which he felt {{could have been used}} for other means such as drama.
