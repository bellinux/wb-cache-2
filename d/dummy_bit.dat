5000|$|One way of {{constructing}} a quantum neuron is to first generalise classical neurons (by padding of ancillary bits) to reversible permutation gates and then generalising them further to make unitary gates. Due to the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics, the copying of the output before {{sending it to}} several neurons in the next layer is non-trivial. This can be replaced with a general quantum unitary acting on the output plus a <b>dummy</b> <b>bit</b> in state [...] That has the classical copying gate (CNOT [...] ) as a special case, {{and in that sense}} generalises the classical copying operation. It can be demonstrated that in this scheme, the quantum neural networks can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. The general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically.|$|E

40|$|Rate-compatible Turbo {{codes are}} part of many mobile {{communication}} systems as, e. g., LTE. The code rate of a fixed-rate mother Turbo code is adapted by bit puncturing and bit repetition. While bit puncturing allows to flexibly increase the effective code rate by discarding {{a certain number of}} encoded bits, bit repetition facilitates lower effective code rates by duplicating a distinct number of encoded bits prior to transmission. The first part of this thesis deals with <b>dummy</b> <b>bit</b> insertion, which is a high potential alternative to bit repetition. Lower code rates can be constructed by inserting known (dummy) bits into the information bit sequence before Turbo coding (referred to as Rate-Compatible Insertion Convolutional (RCIC) Turbo coding). Besides an improved frame error rate performance, a considerable convergence speedup is realized for LTE. These observations are also confirmed by means of their EXIT charts, which have been derived from the EXIT chart of the mother Turbo code using information theoretic models. Similar derivations are also given for Turbo coding with bit puncturing and bit repetition. In all cases, the obtained expressions result in novel semi-analytical rate matching procedures, which determine analytically the optimal code rate required for (nearly) error-free decoding at a specific target channel quality. A successful application of <b>dummy</b> <b>bit</b> insertion to Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes is also provided in this part. The second part of the thesis focuses on Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ). At first, a novel HARQ scheme for LTE based on bit puncturing and <b>dummy</b> <b>bit</b> insertion is proposed. Evaluations of the system throughput have proven that the novel system surpasses the standardized LTE HARQ system {{in a wide range of}} channel conditions. Then, HARQ with unreliable feedback is studied. Based on a general feedback channel model, analytical expressions for the overall system throughput are derived in dependence of the feedback error probabilities and the frame error rates of the HARQ system with reliable feedback. Extensive timeconsuming simulations of the HARQ system with unreliable feedback can, thus, be avoided. Finally, Header bit Assisted Channel Decoding (HACD) is addressed. Upper bounds on the expected gains are determined analytically based on the EXIT chart analysis presented in the first part of this thesis...|$|E

Like other multirate codes based on puncturing or repetition, this new class of codes can adjust the amount of protection given to the information bits, and can be decoded using the same decoder as for the mother codes. Specifically, we focused on the recursive systematic insertion convolutional (RSIC) codes. Our analysis and simulation {{results show that the}} proposed RSIC code achieves a performance which is comparable to the corresponding optimal recursive systematic repetition convolutional (RSRC) cod...|$|R
40|$|In {{multihop}} wireless networks, hidden terminal {{problem is}} common {{and leads to}} collision which {{makes it difficult to}} provide the required quality for multimedia services or support priority-based services. Existing approaches to this problem either sacrifice throughput noticeably or require additional transceivers and channels. In this paper, we propose a new scheme in which a sender inserts a few <b>dummy</b> <b>bits</b> in the data frame and its intended receiver transmits short busy advertisements over the same channel to clear the floor for receiving. It only requires a single transceiver and a single channel. The performance analysis shows that the new scheme has a much higher efficiency than the existing approaches using a single channel and a single transceive...|$|R

However, this relentless march has caused the rapid emergence of variability problems, which have adverse effects on the circuit's performance. This paper {{highlights the importance of}} taking into account process variability aspects in the design of an eSRAM for reducing the excessive design margin, introduced by the corner analysis method. We show that the sensitivity dispersions of the memory to process variations can be mitigated through the use of an appropriate <b>dummy</b> <b>bit</b> line driver (DBD). This component is in fact an essential element in a self-timed memory. We made use of the DBD in a 256 kb SRAM in 90 nm technology process...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple method {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of turbo codes. Distance spectrum analysis is used to identify information bit positions a ected by low-distance error events, which are few in number due to the sparseness of the spectrum. A modi ed encoder inserts <b>dummy</b> <b>bits</b> in these positions, resulting in alower and steeper error oor in the bit-error-rate (BER) performance curve. For su ciently large interleaver size, the only cost is a very slight reduction in the code rate. We illustrate the method using a rate 1 / 2 turbo code, with interleaver length N = 10000 : The proposed method improves the BER by {{an order of magnitude}} at Eb=N 0 = 2 : 5 dB, with a rate loss of only 0. 4 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Today's DRAM {{process is}} {{expected}} to continue scaling, enabling minimum feature sizes below 10 nm. To achieve this, the main challenges to address are expected to be refresh, write recovery time (tWR), and variable retention time (VRT) parameters. This paper proposes enhancement features that address these three scaling parameters by simultaneously co-architecting the controller and DRAM instead of designing them individually. Combining temperature compensated tWR (TCWR) with sub-array level parallelism (SALP) enables tWR relaxation, while further improving performance above a given temperature threshold such as 25 o C. In-DRAM ECC enables efficient repairs when refresh and VRT failures generate fail bits. It also provides additional single bit failure protection, thereby increasing field reliability which is critical for servers. Despite the general perception that in-DRAM ECC is not applicable to server main memories due to excessive chip size increases, the proposed in-DRAM ECC with <b>dummy</b> data <b>bit</b> pre-fetching results in a modest array size increase of only ~ 6. 2 %. By changing the echo-system to enable the proposed features, DRAM scaling {{is expected to}} accelerate further, enabling a continuous supply of low cost, high capacity, high performance, and low power DRAMs for the industry.
