2500|$|In 1990, Yugo America {{introduced}} an {{electronic fuel injection}} version of the Yugo GVX to replace the less expensive carbureted fuel system; however, it arrived too late {{as the result of}} a recall by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States due to a failure to meet exhaust emissions. The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992. The faulted <b>emission</b> <b>system</b> used an [...] "emissions" [...] carburetor of outdated design, a two-way catalyst that required an air pump, and exhaust gas recirculation valve; the outdated, power-reducing application of this equipment on an already under-performing drivetrain was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor drivability and the inability to meet emission standards.|$|E
2500|$|YugoCars, Inc. had {{intended}} to fit their YUGO 45 with the 903cc four (45 HP) with a ZEUNA catalytic converter and Lambda feedback - planned gas mileage was 42 to 45 MPG at 70mph, the <b>emission</b> <b>system</b> was largely {{identical to the one}} used on the Fiat/Bertone X1/9 since the 1980 model year. In late 1983, Zastava had added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine (55 HP) with air-injection and a fuel economy in the 30MPG range.

50|$|Fluorescence {{intensity}} detection {{has developed}} very broadly in the microplate format {{over the last}} two decades. The range of applications is much broader than when using absorbance detection, but instrumentation is usually more expensive. In this type of instrumentation, a first optical system (excitation system) illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator). As a result of the illumination, the sample emits light (it fluoresces) and a second optical system (<b>emission</b> <b>system)</b> collects the emitted light, separates it from the excitation light (using a filter or monochromator system), and measures the signal using a light detector such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The advantages of fluorescence detection over absorbance detection are sensitivity, as well as application range, given the wide selection of fluorescent labels available today. For example, a technique known as calcium imaging measures fluorescence intensity of calcium-sensitive dyes to assess intracellular calcium levels.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescence {{polarization}} measurement is {{also very}} close to FI detection. The {{difference is that the}} optical system includes polarizing filters on the light path: the samples in the microplate are excited using polarized light (instead of non-polarized light in FI and TRF modes). Depending on the mobility of the fluorescent molecules found in the wells, the light emitted will either be polarized or not. For example, large molecules (e.g. proteins) in solution, which rotate relatively slowly because of their size, will emit polarized light when excited with polarized light. On the other hand, the fast rotation of smaller molecules will result in a depolarization of the signal. The <b>emission</b> <b>system</b> of the plate reader uses polarizing filters to analyze the polarity of the emitted light. A low level of polarization indicates that small fluorescent molecules move freely in the sample. A high level of polarization indicates that fluorescent is attached to a larger molecular complex. As a result, one of the basic applications of FP detection is molecular binding assays, since they allow to detect if a small fluorescent molecule binds (or not) to a larger, non-fluorescent molecule: binding results in a slower rotation speed of the fluorescent molecule, and in an increase in the polarization of the signal.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the 351C, {{almost all}} 400 blocks used the large {{bellhousing}} bolt pattern {{used by the}} 385 family big-block and were typically equipped with the higher torque-capacity C6 transmission. There were {{a small number of}} 400 block castings produced in 1973 with the dual bellhousing patterns. It had the large bellhousing and the small bellhousing bolt pattern used by the Windsor V8 family and the 351C, though it was not necessarily drilled for both. These particular blocks have been dubbed the [...] "400 FMX" [...] by enthusiasts, though were never officially referenced as such by Ford. Most 400's also had unique engine mount bolt pattern but these 400 FMX blocks had provisions for both 351C-style and 400/351M engine mounts. For 1972, the compression was reduced through the use of dished pistons. The compression reduced again for 1973 and a new timing set retarded the camshaft timing 6° to aid with reducing emissions. [...] Changes to the cylinder heads for 1975 to add the Thermactor <b>emission</b> <b>system</b> caused the exhaust port to be more restrictive than the earlier 1971-74 heads. The 400 was retuned by Ford in 1975 to use unleaded gasoline with the addition of catalytic converters to the exhaust system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and <b>emission</b> <b>system.</b> This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|E
