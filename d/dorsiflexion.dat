5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited <b>dorsiflexion</b> due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. <b>Dorsiflexion</b> of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

40|$|Background. Changes in the {{modulation}} of soleus alpha motoneuron excitability, as {{assessed by}} H reflexes, and temporal sequencing of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles during voluntary ankle <b>dorsiflexions</b> and plantar flex-ions of young (24. 7 ± 11. 5; n = 13) and older (68. 7 ± 5. 4; n = 13) subjects were assessed to determine potential neural mechanisms that {{might contribute to}} motor control changes associated with aging. Methods. A repetitive stimulation (5 Hz) soleus H-reflex testing protocol and surface electromyography (EMG) {{were used to assess}} the latencies of soleus H-reflex changes in relation to tibialis anterior and soleus EMG activations of standing subjects during voluntary ankle <b>dorsiflexions</b> and plantar flexions at self-selected speeds. The pattern and latency of H-reflex changes in relation to EMG activity were compared between young and old subjects. Results. There were no differences in the relative amount of antagonist muscle (soleus) inhibition during voluntary ankle <b>dorsiflexions</b> between young and old subjects (26. 4 % and 27. 2 % decrease from resting H-reflex values, respec-tively). Older subjects, however, required additional time to achieve these levels of inhibition. Delays in the activation of soleus H reflexes during the plantar flexion task were also observed in older subjects. Older subjects also had con-siderable intra- and intersubject variability in muscle temporal sequencing patterns during ankle plantar flexions. Conclusions. Although older subjects exhibited similar relative levels of alpha motoneuron inhibition and excitation during voluntary movements, this modulation was delayed when compared to younger subjects.

Limbs with CVI due to primary varicose veins showed a higher expelled volume and a more shortened refilling time than limbs with simple varicosities. With application of tourniquets, the refilling time normalized in limbs with CVI, {{as well as in}} limbs with simple varicosities.

25|$|Some hip muscles also act {{on either}} the knee joint or on {{vertebral}} joints. Additionally, because the area of origin and insertion {{of many of these}} muscles are very extensive, these muscles are often involved in several very different movements. In the hip joint, lateral and medial rotation occur along the axis of the limb; extension (also called <b>dorsiflexion</b> or retroversion) and flexion (anteflexion or anteversion) occur along a transverse axis; and abduction and adduction occur about a sagittal axis.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} include pain, refusing to walk or bear weight and limping -bruising and deformity are absent. On clinical examination, {{there can be}} warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards (<b>dorsiflexion).</b> The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal. After 1–2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for osteomyelitis, transient synovitis or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the <b>dorsiflexion</b> muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is leaned on the ankle joint by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the ankle joint as the individual bends at the knee. This stretch is typically held for 15–30 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Proper muscle {{activity}} quantification {{is highly}} relevant {{to monitor and}} treat spastic cocontraction. As activity may distribute unevenly within muscle volumes, particularly for pennate calf muscles, surface electromyograms (EMGs) detected by traditional bipolar montage may provide biased estimations of muscle activity. We compared cocontraction estimates obtained using bipolar vs grids of electrodes (high-density EMG, HD-EMG). EMGs were collected from medial gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior during isometric plantar and dorsi-flexion efforts at three levels (30 %, 70 % and 100 % MVC), knee flexed and extended. Cocontraction index (CCI) was estimated separately for each electrode pair in the grid. While soleus and tibialis anterior CCI estimates did {{not depend on the}} detection system considered, for gastrocnemius bipolar electrodes provided larger cocontraction estimates than HD-EMG at highest effort levels, at both knee angles (ANOVA; P <. 001). Interestingly, HD-EMG detected greater gastrocnemius EMGs distally during plantar flexions, and greater CCI values proximally during <b>dorsiflexions.</b> These results suggest that bipolar electrodes: (i) provide reliable estimates of soleus and tibialis anterior cocontraction; (ii) may under-or overestimate gastrocnemius cocontraction, depending on their distal or proximal position...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, venous {{function}} was evaluated by simultaneous strain gauge plethysmographic (SGP) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) techniques {{before and after}} varicose vein surgery. In plethysmography, expelled volume dur-ing five active <b>dorsiflexions</b> of the feet and venous recovery time were calcu-lated to evaluate muscle efficiency and valvular competence.

This early postoperative venous dysfunction may be due to residual incompetence of the small veins and reduction of the communica-tions between the superficial veins or the superficial and deep veins. The parameters improved three and six months after surgery, suggesting a recovery of the tone of the small veins and the development of collaterals. One year postoperatively, however, the venous function worsened again.

40|$|Locust {{can jump}} {{precisely}} to a target, yet {{they can also}} tumble during the trajectory. We propose two mechanisms {{that would allow the}} locust to control tumbling during the jump. The first is that prior to the jump, locusts adjust the pitch of their body to move the center of mass closer to the intended thrust vector. The second is that contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles during the jump will produce torques that counter the torque produced by thrust. We found that locusts increased their take-off angle as the initial body pitch increased, and that little tumbling occurred for jumps that observed this relationship. Simulations of locust jumping demonstrated that a pitch versus take-off angle relationship that minimized tumbling in simulated jumps was similar to the relationship observed in live locusts. Locusts were strongly biased to pitch head-upward, and performed <b>dorsiflexions</b> far more often than ventral flexions. The direction and magnitude of tumbling could be controlled in simulations by adjusting the tension in the dorsolongitudinal muscles. These mechanisms allowed the simulations to match the data from the live animals. Control of tumbling was also found to influence the control of jump elevation. The bias to pitch head-upwards may have an evolutionary advantage when evading a predator and so make control of tumbling important for the locust...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{a test of}} the hypothesis that gain in the stretch reflex pathway of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle during locomotion increases after denervation of its synergists, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PL) muscles. In four cats, MG, tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were implanted with electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. The cats walked on a row of elevated pegs, some of which were spring-loaded and could be triggered to pop up at the moment of foot touchdown, rapidly dorsiflexing the foot. Pre-stretch EMG activity in MG as well as short-, medium- and long-latency responses to the <b>dorsiflexions</b> were compared before and after unilateral denervation of synergists. Short- and medium-latency responses of MG to perturbations increased in proportion to the increase in pre-stretch EMG {{in the days and weeks}} after partial denervation. This argues against an adaptive increase in stretch reflex gain independent of centrally generated extensor drive. Local anaesthesia of the skin of the paw did not significantly change the sizes of the stretch responses of MG before or after partial denervation. We conclude that pre-stretch EMG activity as well as stretch reflexes in MG muscle increased substantially after denervation of synergistic muscles. The data were consistent with an adaptive increase in central locomotor drive, causing more motoneuronal activity, which in turn resulted in an increase in the size of stretch reflexes...|$|R

40|$|Pain elicits complex {{adaptations of}} motor strategy, leading to {{impairments}} {{in the generation}} and control of steady forces, which depend on muscle architecture. The present study used a cross-over design to assess the effects of muscle pain on the stability of multidirectional (taskrelated and tangential) forces during sustained <b>dorsiflexions,</b> elbow flexions, knee extensions, and plantarflexions. Fifteen healthy subjects performed series of isometric contractions (13 -s duration, 2. 5, 20, 50, 70 % of maximal voluntary force) before, during, and after experimental muscle pain. Three-dimensional force magnitude, angle and variability were measured while the task-related force was provided as feedback to the subjects. Surface electromyography was recorded from agonist and antagonist muscles. Pain was induced in agonist muscles by intramuscular injections of hypertonic (6 %) saline with isotonic (0. 9 %) saline injections as control. The pain intensity was assessed on an electronic visual analogue scale. Experimental muscle pain elicited larger ranges of force angle during knee extensions and plantarflexions (P < 0. 03) and higher normalized fluctuations of task-related (P < 0. 02) and tangential forces (P < 0. 03) compared with control assessments across force levels, while the mean force magnitudes, mean force angle {{and the level of}} muscle activity were non-significantly affected by pain. Increased multidirectional force fluctuations probably resulted from multiple mechanisms that, acting together, balanced the mean surface electromyography. Although pain adaptations are believed to aim at the protection of the painful site, the current results show that they result in impairments in steadiness of force...|$|R
40|$|Aim Motor {{units are}} {{recruited}} {{in an orderly}} manner according to the size of motor neurons. Moreover, because larger motor neurons innervate fibers with larger diameters than smaller motor neurons, motor units should be recruited orderly according to their conduction velocity (MUCV). Because of technical limitations, these relations have been previously tested either indirectly or in small motor unit samples that revealed weak associations between motor unit recruitment threshold (RT) and MUCV. Here we analyze the relation between MUCV and RT for large samples of motor units. Methods Ten healthy volunteers completed a series of isometric ankle <b>dorsiflexions</b> at forces up to 70 % of the maximum. Multi-channel surface electromyographic signals recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle were decomposed into single motor unit action potentials, from which the corresponding motor unit RT, MUCV, and action potential amplitude were estimated. Established relations between muscle fiber diameter and CV were used to estimate the fiber size. Results Within individual subjects, the distributions of MUCV and fiber diameters were unimodal and did not show distinct populations. MUCV was strongly correlated with RT (mean (SD) R 2 = 0. 7 (0. 09), p< 0. 001; 406 motor units), which supported the hypothesis that fiber diameter is associated to RT. Conclusion The results provide further evidence for the relations between motor neuron and muscle fiber properties for large samples of motor units. The proposed methodology for motor unit analysis has also the potential to open new perspectives in the study of chronic and acute neuromuscular adaptations to ageing, training, and pathology...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that chronic {{unilateral}} motor activity or electromyostimulation (EMS) may result in bilateral adaptation, a phenomenon termed cross education. One of the hypotheses for the potential mechanisms of cross education is an adaptation caused by bilateral cortical coactivation during unilateral voluntary exercise. Whether EMS induced cross education involves bilateral cortical activation is unknown. This study aimed to examine cortical activities by functional MRI (fMRI) during unilateral voluntary and EMS evoked muscle contractions. Six healthy young men performed two tasks. One was three sets of 10 maximum isometric <b>dorsiflexions</b> of the right ankle, each set for 1 -min followed by 1 -min rest; {{and the other was}} three sets of 1 -min EMS on tibialis anterior muscle at a duty cycle of 3 -s on 3 -s off, each followed by 1 -min rest. During the tasks brain fMRI images were obtained using a 1. 5 T GE MRI scanner, and analysed using SPM 99 software. Results demonstrated bilateral activation of the primary motor area, secondary somatosensory area and cingulate gyrus area during both tasks. Furthermore, the voluntary contraction increased fMRI signals in supplementary motor area, premotor cortex and cerebellum bilaterally, and primary somatosensory area of the contralateral side; while EMS increased bilateral activity in primary somatosensory area and ipsilateral premotor cortex and contralateral supplementary motor area. It was evident that the voluntary and EMS tasks activated certain common areas as well as specific areas in the brain, indicating cortical mechanisms may be involved in both voluntary exercise and EMS induced cross education...|$|R

In this study, different location of electrical stimulation (ES), nerve or muscle, was paired with voluntary movement to investigate if ES paired with voluntary movement a) {{would increase the}} excitability of cortical projections to tibialis anterior and b) if stimulation location mattered. Cortical excitability changes were quantified using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation at varying intensities during four conditions. Twelve healthy subjects performed 50 <b>dorsiflexions</b> at the ankle during nerve or muscle ES at motor threshold. ES alone was delivered 50 times and the movement was performed 50 times. A {{significant increase in the}} excitability from pre- to post-intervention (P= 0. 0061) and pre- to 30 minutes post-intervention (P= 0. 017) measurements was observed when voluntary movement was paired with muscle ES located at tibialis anterior. An increase of 50 ± 57 % and 28 ± 54 % in the maximum MEPs was obtained for voluntary movement paired with muscle-located and nerve-located ES, respectively. The maximum MEPs for voluntary movement alone and muscle-located ES alone were - 5 ± 28 % and 2 ± 42 %, respectively. Pairing voluntary movement with muscle-located ES increases excitability of corticospinal projections of tibialis anterior in healthy participants.

EEG signals were recorded during ballistic ankle <b>dorsiflexions</b> executed (ME) or imagined (MI) by 20 healthy subjects, and attempted by five stroke subjects. These recordings were used to identify a template (as average over all subjects) for the initial negative phase of the MRCPs, after the application of an optimized spatial filtering used for pre-processing. Using this template, the detection accuracy (mean +/- A SD) calculated as true positive rate (estimated with leave-one-out procedure) for ME was 69 +/- A 21 and 58 +/- A 11 % on single trial basis for healthy and stroke subjects, respectively. This performance was similar to that obtained using an individual template for each subject, which led to accuracies of 71 +/- A 6 and 55 +/- A 12 % for healthy and stroke subjects, respectively. The detection accuracy for the MI data was 65 +/- A 22 % with the average template and 60 +/- A 13 % with the individual template.

Although {{numerous}} studies revealed that isokinetic dynamometers were valuable tools for assessing spastic hyper-tonia, no standard methodology using such devices is currently widespread in clinical setting. The {{aim of this}} study was to standardize a protocol to assess spastic hypertonia in the triceps surae. Methods. The passive resistance during <b>dorsiflexions</b> imposed from 10 to 300 °/s with an isokinetic dynamometer was measured at the neutral position in 15 patients with spastic hypertonia and 12 healthy subjects. The normalized passive resistance was obtained by expressing raw passive resistance as a percent of the values measured at the lowest velocity (10 °/s). EMG signals from plantar and dorsiflexors were also recorded. Findings. While no significant difference between spastic patients and control subjects was observed in raw passive resistance values, the difference was significant for each tested velocity when considering the normalized values. Furthermore, the Ashworth score was significantly correlated with the normalized passive resistance for each velocity whereas no correlation was observed with the raw passive resistance. For the patients, except at the highest velocity, the normalized passive resistance was not affected by the fact that reflex responses in the triceps surae were elicited or not. Interpretation. The normalized passive resistance, expressed with respect to the initial one, i. e., measured at very low velocity, seems a very effective parameter to quantify the velocity-dependent increase in resistance to passive stretch in spastic plantarflexors. However, while the simplicity of the isokinetic tests and the reduced time of data treatment seems to support the clinical use of this methodology, further investigations are required to definitely standardize the protocol...|$|R

40|$|The {{adaptations of}} the ankle dorsiflexor muscles and the {{behaviour}} of single motor {{units in the}} tibialis anterior in response to 12 weeks of dynamic training were studied in five human subjects. In each training session ten series of ten fast <b>dorsiflexions</b> were performed 5 days a week, against a load of 30 – 40 % of the maximal muscle strength. Training led to an enhancement of maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVC) and the speed of voluntary ballistic contraction. This last enhancement was mainly related to neural adaptations since {{the time course of}} the muscle twitch induced by electrical stimulation remained unaffected. The motor unit torque, recorded by the spike-triggered averaging method, increased without any change in its time to peak. The orderly motor unit recruitment (size principle) was preserved during slow ramp contraction after training but the units were activated earlier and had a greater maximal firing frequency during voluntary ballistic contractions. In addition, the high frequency firing rate observed {{at the onset of the}} contractions was maintained during the subsequent spikes after training. Dynamic training induced brief (2 – 5 ms) motor unit interspike intervals, or ‘doublets’. These doublets appeared to be different from the closely spaced (± 10 ms) discharges usually observed at the onset of the ballistic contractions. Motor units with different recruitment thresholds showed doublet discharges and the percentage of the sample of units firing doublets was increased by training from 5. 2 to 32. 7 %. The presence of these discharges was observed not only at the onset of the series of spikes but also later in the electromyographic (EMG) burst. It is likely that earlier motor unit activation, extra doublets and enhanced maximal firing rate contribute to the increase in the speed of voluntary muscle contraction after dynamic training...|$|R
40|$|Mental {{practice}} {{refers to}} the cognitive rehearsal of a physical activity. It is widely used by athletes to enhance their performance and its efficiency to help train motor function in people with physical disabilities is now recognized. Mental practice is generally based on motor imagery (MI) i. e. the conscious simulation of a movement without its actual execution. It may also be based on verbal rehearsal (VR) i. e. the silent rehearsal of the labels associated with an action. In this study, the effect of MI training or VR on the learning and retention of a foot-sequence task was investigated. Thirty right-footed subjects, aged between 22 and 37 years old (mean: 27. 4 &# 177; 4. 1 years) and {{randomly assigned to one}} of three groups, practiced a serial reaction time task involving a sequence of three <b>dorsiflexions</b> and three plantar flexions with the left foot. One group (n= 10) mentally practiced the sequence with MI for five weeks, another group (n= 10) mentally practiced the sequence with VR of the foot positions for the same duration, and a control group (n= 10) did not practice the sequence mentally. The time to perform the practiced sequence as well as an unpracticed sequence was recorded before training, immediately after training and six months after training (retention). The main results showed that the speed improvement after training was significantly greater in the MI group compared to the control group and tended to be greater in the VR group compared to the control group. The improvement in performance did not differ in the MI and VR groups. At retention, however, no difference in response times was found among the three groups, indicating that the effect of mental practice did not last over a long period without training. Interestingly, this pattern of results was similar for the practiced and non-practiced sequence. Overall, these results suggest that both MI training and VR help to improve motor performance and that mental practice may induce non-specific effects...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of muscle}} mass with age, termed sarcopenia, {{is a common}} problem among the over 60 years-old population. Resistance {{training}} is often prescribed as treatment, but older adults have shown a reduced response to exercise. Muscle stiffness is shown to increase with age due to increased glycation. Increased stiffness will cause muscle cells to experience less strain for any given load. Strain {{is known to be}} the mechanical signal for a muscle's response to exercise, which leads us to hypothesize that response to exercise is impaired because of increased stiffness. Nineteen rats were split into young (12 months) and old (32 - 33 months) groups. Each rat underwent 3 sets of 10 maximum eccentric <b>dorsiflexions.</b> Following sacrifice, the tibialis anterior (TA) of both legs and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) of the non-exercised leg harvested. The EDL underwent stiffness testing to determine the Young's modulus of the muscle. Focal adhesison kinase (FAK) is a protein that is phosphorylated with stretch, making it a good indicator of exercise response. The TAs were used in immunoblotting analysis to determine the ratio of FAK that was phosphorylated. Our study showed decreases in muscle size and increases in muscle stiffness with age, with more variability occurring in older rats. A negative relationship was also seen between muscle stiffness and size. The main findings of our study showed that FAK activity decreases are related to muscle stiffness. The results of this study show that aging is similar between rats and humans, in regards to muscle size and stiffness, and suggest sarcopenic muscle is stiffer than healthy muscle. The results also suggest old muscle loses the capacity to hypertrophy in response to exercise and that increased muscle stiffness is responsible for the decreased response to exercise. This study implicates that reduced response to exercise due to increased muscle stiffness is a possible mechanism behind the development of sarcopenia. M. S...|$|R
