The use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets. But {{if there are no}} gateway stations to cover certain remote areas (such as areas of the South Pacific and the polar regions), service cannot be provided in these remote areas, even if the satellites may fly over them. As of May 2012, voice and full-duplex data service is currently non-functional over much of Africa, the South Asian subcontinent and most mid-ocean regions due to lack of nearby <b>gateway</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E

Both ORBCOMM spacecraft connected automatically with a <b>Gateway</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Station</b> (GES) about 8 hours after launch. Nominal early passes focused on post-launch housekeeping tasks. However, a series of anomalies developed: including loss of gateway uplink, gateway downlink transmitter oscillation, poor GPS position fixing, subscriber downlink transmitter lock-up, and several software problems. All these conditions were unique to the space environment or resulted from minor design changes or oversights. Eventually the spacecraft were recovered from their outages and the causes conclusively determined.

40|$|ORBCOMM, a {{subsidiary}} of Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), has designed a system to provide low-cost mobile two-way data communications for worldwide commercial markets. The primary application areas are data communications and messaging. The ORBCOMM System has been designed so a user can compose, transmit, and receive messages; control and monitor assets; and collect data on hand-held subscriber communicators (SC's). With a constellation of 36 LEO satellites and terrestrial facilities, users in the temperature climate zones {{around the world will}} have a satellite in view over 98 % of the time, and will have to wait less than two minutes {{the rest of the time}} to directly access a satellite. A message transmitted from a SC and received by the satellite is relayed down to a regional <b>gateway</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> (GES). The GES then transmits the message via fiber land-lines to the network control center (NCC). The NCC then determines the location of the recipient of the message and routes the message accordingly. The NCC can receive and transmit messages from terrestrial networks via X. 400 and X. 25 gateways. The NCC can translate messages from widely used e-mail systems such as Internet, cc:Mail, and Microsoft Mail into X. 400 messages for transmission to and from ORBCOMM SC's...|$|R
50|$|Site C {{originally}} had 633 acre near Falkland, North Carolina. This site {{is the only}} receiving station in the area. In 1968, this station was rededicated as Edward R. Murrow Transmitting Station, in honor of Edward R. Murrow, {{former director of the}} United States Information Agency. In 1971, a private agribusiness, {{with the help of a}} local congressman, buried toxic waste from a fire at a chemical storage warehouse. Personnel stopped using the site in 1985. In 1987, the site became a <b>gateway</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>station</b> for the Global Satellite Interconnect System. In 1994, the General Services Administration sold the site, minus 55 acre that contained the toxic waste, to the State of North Carolina and local governments. The site closed on March 31, 1995, due to budget reductions and changes in technology. In 1998, satellite dishes were placed in on the Cohen Building in Washington, D.C. Greenville then became a receive-only station and acted as a backup to the headquarters site. It was decommissioned in 1999 and sold to East Carolina University in 2001. Today the land is used by the Department of Biology for research and ROTC for training. There are seven buildings with 33,000 sq ft of space. Also, the North Carolina AgroMedicine Institute, a facility for the Office of State Archaeology. Blackbeard's flagship, Queen Anne's Revenge artifacts are being restored there.|$|R
50|$|Along with {{dramatic}} advances in satellite technology {{over the past}} decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.The Gateway—or <b>Gateway</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Station</b> (its full name)—is {{also referred to as}} a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components. In short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.The system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for subscriber terminal connections to the Internet.In the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the gateway antenna can stay pointed at a fixed position.|$|R
40|$|The ORBCOMM {{system is}} {{designed}} to provide low-cost, two-way data communications for mobile and remote users. The communications system is ideally configured for low data rate applications where communicating devices are geographically dispersed and two-way communications through terrestrial means is cumbersome and not cost effective. The remote terminals use VHF frequencies which allow for the use of very small, low-cost terminals. ORBCOMM has entered into joint development agreements with several large manufacturers of both consumer and industrial electronics to design and build the remote terminals. Based on prototype work, the estimated retail cost of these units will range from $ 50 to $ 400 depending on the complexity of the design. Starting in the fall of 1993, ORBCOMM will begin service with a demonstration network consisting of two operating satellites. By the end of 1994, a full operating network of 26 satellites, four <b>Gateway</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Stations,</b> and a Network Control Center will be in place. The full constellation will provide full coverage of the entire world with greater than 94 percent communications availability for the continental U. S.

The NGS provides tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&C) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) network control functions. The LET supports technology verification and high data rate experiments. The ground stations successfully demonstrated many services and applications at Ka-band in three different modes of operation: circuit switched TDMA using the satellite on-board processor, satellite switched SS-TDMA applications using the on-board Microwave Switch Matrix (MSM), and conventional transponder (bent-pipe) operation. Data rates ranged from 4. 8 kbps up to 622 Mbps. Experiments included: 1) low rate (4. 8 - 1 00 's kbps) remote data acquisition and control using small earth stations, 2) moderate rate (1 - 45 Mbps) experiments included full duplex voice and video conferencing and both full duplex and asymmetric data rate protocol and network evaluation using mid-size ground stations, and 3) link characterization experiments and high data rate (155 - 622 Mbps) terrestrial and satellite interoperability application experiments conducted by a consortium of experimenters using the large transportable ground stations...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for broadband multimedia services and their extension to mobiles has spurred provision via satellites. This is because satellite systems {{can provide a}} truly global coverage that cannot be economically realised by either fixed wireline systems or terrestrial mobile systems. Most of next generation satellite systems proposed, such as Astrolink, SPACEWAY and SkyBridge, consider using ATM or ATM based technology over satellite to provide broadband services requiring mobility and higher bandwidth. This thesis therefore concerns future broadband satellite networks that use on-board processing and intersatellite links to extend the terrestrial ATM provision to worldwide satellite systems. This thesis discusses the air interface connection management and call handling schemes for integrated mobile/fixed ATM-satellite networks. The prime aim is to research an integrated solution that provides effective radio connection management and mobility support whilst maintaining the required QoS at both user terminals and <b>gateway</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> We target at minimising the difference in performance between terrestrial ATM and ATM over satellite and providing mobility extension to the ATM protocols, whilst maintaining a high satellite channel efficiency and keeping {{as little as possible}} signalling modifications. In this thesis, an efficient radio connection management scheme, which is designed for a QoS-provisioning transport of ATM traffic over satellite links, and a mobility-enhanced signalling protocol scheme for mobile ATM-satellite networks are proposed. Another large proportion of this thesis is devoted to the optimisations of multiple access and logic link control because these are the major factors that effecting the performance within ATM- satellite integrated systems. As a result, a semi-permanent signalling protocol, a reliability- dependent Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat reQuest (SR ARQ) and an adaptive timer SR ARQ are proposed. In addition to the proposed connection management scheme, a reservation meta-signalling for setting up signalling connections at the user-network radio interface and a mobility-enhanced call handling protocol derived from Q. 2931 are proposed. Call control functions such as call routing, location update, paging, handover and authentication are discussed as well. The proposed signalling protocol architecture provides a protocol reference model for ATM-satellite integrated systems. The verification and demonstration of the advantages of the semi-permanent signalling protocol, which offers a new method to improve the system channel efficiency on signalling connections, have been achieved. The proposed reliability-dependent SR ARQ protocol provides a novel approach to optimise the transmission throughput to support a variety of traffic types with different QoS requirements in ATM-satellite systems. The proposed connection management scheme effectively manages the air interface connections for ATM services through diversifying connection types, establishing QoS-based connections and deploying an efficient connection mapping and control scheme. The proposed radio connection management scheme together with the optimised Multiple Access Control (MAC) and ARQ provides a framework of interworking protocols for ATM over satellites. It can also find application in other similar systems that involve the integration of terrestrial protocols and mobile satellites. The research work that has been accomplished herein provides a solution and guidance to the design of signalling protocols for mobile satellite systems to implement ATM technology or indeed other future protocols...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances and standardization {{has led to the}} large scale adoption of personal mobile communications. Within years global personal communications will be provided by non-geostationary satellites. These satellite systems will complement the terrestrial mobile network coverage to provide one complete global network. Mobility management is a key issue in any personal communications network. Furthermore, the seamless integration between satellite and terrestrial systems will {{play a major role in}} the adoption of satellite personal communications. This thesis focuses on the optimization of mobility management procedures in an integrated satellite and GSM personal communication network. The coverage and mobile channel properties of first generation non-geostationary constellation proposals are analyzed (these being Globalstar, ICO and Iridium). A new LEO satellite constellation is proposed that has a similar number of satellites as Globalstar and Iridium but provides superior levels of satellite visibility over its service area. In order to overcome the problem of location area definition in a non-geostationary satellite constellation, two techniques are presented. Subsequently, the paging and location update signalling loads for each scheme are evaluated and optimized particularly in the urban and highway environments. These results are combined to arrive at the optimum location area size for each method of location area definition. A further problem caused by the motion of satellites is defining the service area of a <b>gateway</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> A previously proposed scheme is presented and its restrictions and implications discussed. Subsequently, a new scheme is proposed based on the highest satellite connectivity. This scheme is then combined with the optimized location area definition identified previously. Finally, issues associated with the integration of the two optimized schemes with the GSM system are presented...|$|R
