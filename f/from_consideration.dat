5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name <b>from</b> <b>consideration</b> if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H.

Following its publication, Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993).|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name <b>from</b> <b>consideration.</b> While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear <b>from</b> <b>consideration</b> {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a particular}} problem attendant upon the hypothesis that phonological patterns emerge directly <b>from</b> <b>considerations</b> of phonetic functionality: {{the problem is that}} phonological patterns frequently display stability across tokens and contexts, where direct phonetic conditioning would predict variation. I suggest that this stabilization might emerge from an exemplar-based speech processing system, which, in essence, enforces the notion of analogical pattern extension. This paper discusses {{a particular problem}} attendant upon the hypothesis that phonological patterns emerge directly <b>from</b> <b>considerations</b> of phonetic functionality, and tentatively explores a possible solution. The problem is that many sound patterns display a certain stability, across tokens and contexts, which is difficult to account for in terms of purely phonetic considerations; moreover, these stabilized patterns and categorical than raw phonetic representations (see Anderson 1981...|$|R

5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded <b>from</b> <b>consideration</b> when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{called a}} special session in March 1897 to resume the balloting for senator. He {{appointed}} Andrew T.

When continued deadlock between Hunter and Blackburn ensued, Hunter withdrew his name <b>from</b> <b>consideration.</b> Republicans nominated St. John Boyle, but the gridlock continued unabated. After several ballots, Boyle also withdrew, and Republicans put forth lawyer and State senator William Joseph Deboe in his place.
