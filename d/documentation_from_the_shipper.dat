30|$|One could suggest {{in order}} to limit {{reduction}} costs, these costs should be calculated according to the borne ton criteria. This {{has the potential to}} lead to a selective “loading” of the reduction costs on <b>the</b> <b>shipper,</b> for example: sea freight of electronic goods (i.e., - computers and technology equipment) in container vessels are considered lightweight freight, but highly valuable. An attempt to implement calculation according to borne ton criteria could lead to higher payment request <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> in correlation to a similar sea freight of less valuable merchandise, reducing the consumer’s surplus furthermore.|$|R

The issue is what the appropriate accounting method(s) should be for recognizing revenue and expense related to a freight service company's freight-in-transit {{at the end of}} a reporting period.

30|$|The {{remaining}} four pre-defined {{practices are}} {{described in more detail}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> side than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LSP side. Regarding mode choice and intermodal transportation, the LSPs express in a very general way that intermodal transports are part of their offering in environmental terms, while many of <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> describe more concretely their ambition regarding specific modes. For the practice logistics system design, the LSPs describe the design of their transport network, while <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> describe efforts needed to make their logistics system more environmentally friendly. Transport management is described quite sparsely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LSPs compared to <b>the</b> <b>shippers,</b> who comprise a wide variety of efforts to increase the efficiency of the transports. The pattern that emerges is <b>the</b> opposite <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one described for the first six practices: <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> appear as more specific as they describe features relating to their system, which in turn creates the demands.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic freight assignment model that captures the shipper-carrier {{mechanism of the}} freight industry. <b>The</b> <b>shippers</b> minimize their cost by choosing a carrier with the lowest shipping cost for each shipment. The market reaches equilibrium when no shipper can reduce its cost further by changing the carrier for any shipment. Each carrier optimizes its operations {{so that it can}} reduce its shipping costs and attract more business <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shippers.</b> An iterative variational inequality (VI) formulation is used to model the market equilibrium including <b>the</b> feedback <b>from</b> <b>the</b> carriers to <b>the</b> <b>shippers.</b> <b>The</b> cost function in the VI is obtained from a carrier submodel that is a dynamic, multimodal, multicommodity network-assignment model based on a linear programming formulation.

For example, “Calculation of customers’ emissions” was categorised as an LSP offering relating to emission data, and “We expect transport providers to follow established environmental standards” was categorised as a shipper requirement related to environmental management systems. General statements, mainly among <b>the</b> <b>shippers,</b> relating to environmental responsibility regarding their own products and customer offers or to product suppliers were not recorded in this investigation.|$|R

As a result of these cases, Congress established a new system of grain inspections. Gallinghouse's work in this case brought favorable comments from U.S. Senator Hubert H.
