40|$|Introduction. Recovery {{following}} various physical exercises is {{a complicated}} process. The exercise session can involve strong demands on both muscle structure and energy production (aerobic and anaerobic). Many exercise sessions also induce muscle damage (exercise induced muscle damage; EIMD). Different recovery methods attempt to alleviate or prevent EIMD and its associated symptoms, such as muscle soreness and swelling, and reduction in muscle function. One of the used strategies is cold treatment (cryotherapy), which decreases tissue temperature and subsequently effects on e. g. blood flow, metabolism and neural conductance velocity. To date, there is conflicting {{evidence to support the}} use of cryotherapy following a single exercise, and only few studies have examined the effect of it over a longer time period. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of cryotherapy on recovery and on the amount of EIMD both after an anaerobic running exercise and over a weeklong training period. Moreover, a recently developed cooling technique called cold mist shower (Amandan®, Amandan Healthcare Oy Ltd., www. amandan. <b>fi,</b> <b>Finland,</b> 2015) was tested. Methods. A total of eight male subjects (age 22. 9 ± 1. 4 years, height 1. 77 ± 0. 06 m, weight 79. 1 ± 7. 6 kg, and fat percentage 13. 3 ± 2. 9 %) participated in the study, which consisted of an acute phase of 48 h and a weeklong training period. All subjects completed the study protocol both with (COLD) and without (CONTROL) cryotherapy (2 min at 10 – 15 °C) in a random order. The acute responses were measured after an anaerobic running (10 x 20 m shuttle running twice, with a 3 min break). Cryotherapy was applied immediately, and 12, 24 and 36 h after the running exercise. The training period consisted of three hypertrophic strength training sessions and three anaerobic interval running sessions on alternating days, and cryotherapy was applied once after every training session. Muscle damage (myoglobin, creatine kinase, CK), inflammation (C-reactive protein), endocrine responses (testosterone, SHBG and cortisol) and perception of muscle soreness (DOMS) were measured before (Pre) and immediately (0 min), 30 min, 60 min, 24 h and 48 h after the running exercise, and 4 d after the training period (Post). Anaerobic metabolism (lactate) was evaluated at Pre, 0, 30 and 60 min. Maximal voluntary isometric force of the knee extensors, jumping ability (a countermovement jump), and 10 x 20 m maximal sprint running were evaluated at Pre, 48 h and Post. Results. The intensive anaerobic running exercise (peak blood lactate in CONTROL 16. 3 ± 3. 6 vs. in COLD 16. 2 ± 3. 4 mmol/l) induced a small increase in DOMS, myoglobin and CK levels in both groups, and there were no differences between the groups (P > 0. 05). Following the training period, myoglobin concentration was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in COLD compared to CONTROL (COLD 24. 64 ± 5. 63 ng/ml vs. CONTROL 36. 35 ± 14. 02 ng/ml). In COLD, the Post-value was also significantly (P < 0. 05) lower compared to the Pre-value both in myoglobin (Pre 29. 95 ± 6. 90 ng/ml vs. Post 24. 64 ± 5. 63 ng/ml) and in CK (Pre 251. 00 ± 143. 83 U/l vs. Post 168. 13 ± 91. 90 U/l). In physical performance variables there were no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion. The finding in myoglobin provides some evidence that the cold mist shower might decrease the amount of EIMD over a weeklong training period. However, no cold mist effects on the acute recovery after anaerobic running exercise were observed...|$|E

In addition, convenience, user friendliness and speed emerged as the main sub-topics related to satisfaction. In most cases, the convenience of using m-banking dominated the recommendation criteria. However, users, especially those in ZA, generally do not promote m-banking services to others. This study shows that for the majority of users, m-banking usage is related to increased satisfaction with the bank, implying that m-banking services should be a vital part of banks' strategy to retain customers...|$|R

40|$|Early {{nutrition}} programming as an {{origin of}} obesity is well acknowledged, {{but to what}} extent is this concept communicated to parents? In five European countries, UK, <b>Finland</b> (<b>FI),</b> Germany (DE), Hungary (HU) and Spain (ES), a total of 130 stand alone leaflets and 161 articles from parenting magazines providing information on feeding of healthy infants aged 0 - 12 months were identified and screened for nutrition programming statements. Obesity was mentioned in 8. 5 % (54 / 638) of the statements, and was the fourth most frequent outcome after allergy (20. 7 %), risk of infections (15. 5 %) and growth and development (11. 4 %). A temporal prognosis was given in 39 % of obesity related statements, 6 % referring to short- (15 years) duration of effects. So advice on obesity focuses oil the intrinsic long-term perspective of programming in contrary to other surveyed health-outcomes where only 8 % considered a lifelong approach. The major programming related behaviour concerned breast-feeding compared to formula and complementary feeding with meaningful differences concerning the recommended duration: for ES and HU the predominant advice was for exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months, for DE exclusive breast-feeding for 4 - 6 months and for UK and FI breast-feeding without further specification. In summary, statements relating to the programming of later obesity have been partially integrated into feeding information in five European countries. These Countries have slightly different breastfeeding recommendations, but consistently refer to the preventive potential of breastfeeding in general. This is important as obesity and its resulting morbidity are of increasing public health concern in developed countries...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} around the world use coal as fuel for the purpose of power generation. The extraction of coal produces large volumes of waste rock (WR) that are sometimes sulphide rich (principally containing iron sulphides such as pyrite (FeS 2) and pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS)), with varying quantities of trace elements such as As, Si, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo and Cr etc). Such waste is environmentally sensitive due to the risk of oxidation in presence of atmospheric oxygen and water. Sulphide oxidation may result in acidic waters (acid mine drainage, AMD), which often contains high loads of dissolved metals. Coal combustion results in large amounts of fly ash (FA), which also is of environmental concern. However, FA is alkaline and may potentially be used for neutralisation of AMD. Therefore, the AMD producing potential of WR from coal mining and the neutralisation potential of FAs from coal and biomass combustion was studied with the ultimate goal to develop a methodology to decrease the environmental problems related to these materials. WR was sampled form the Lakhra coal field in Pakistan, which has an estimated coal reserve of 1. 3 Bton, from lignite to sub-bituminous in quality. The WR samples were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods and the acid producing potential was determined by static (Acid Base Accounting) and kinetic (modified humidity cells test) methods. Besides organic material, the WRs are composed of quartz, pyrite, kaolinite, hematite and gypsum with varying amounts of calcite, lime, malladerite, spangolite, franklinite and birnessite. The Lakhra WR has strong potential to generate AMD (- 70 to - 492 kg CaCO 3 /ton) and pollute natural waters by leaching of elements such as Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and SO 42 -. Three different FAs based on the origin, fuel type and storage methods were studied. They were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods, the leachability was studied by batch leaching tests and the potential for buffering acids and neutralisation of AMD was quantified. Fly ash from burning i) brown coal (lignite) in Pakistan (PK), ii) black (bituminous) coal from <b>Finland</b> (<b>FI)</b> and iii) biomass FA provided by a sulphate pulp and paper mill in Sweden (SE) were studied. All ashes contained quarts, PK also iron oxide, anhydrite, and magnesioferrite, FI also mullite and lime, and SE also calcite and anorthite. All ashes were enriched in As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn compared to continental crust, and all ashes had a strong neutralisation potential, the bioash, SE, in particular. The results are encouraging and suggest {{that it is possible to}} use FA to mitigate the environmental problems with coal mine WR. Methods for that will be the focus for the continued research.

40|$|This thesis {{will show}} how patents {{policies}} {{can help the}} commercialization of inventions in Europe. Our study is mainly based on statistical material contained in the European Patent Office’s (EPO) database of published granted patents. Our study covers 407 granted patents {{in the field of}} chemistry and handling & processing in a one period year starting on 2007 - 12 - 24 and ending on 2008 - 12 - 26. Given the scope of data analysis, we found a tendency to limit the patents post (after) grant to a few states in Europe, mainly to Germany (DE), France (FR), Great Britain (GB), Italy (IT), Spain (ES), The Netherlands (NL) and Sweden (SE). This limitation in time and designated states is an indication that the markets in these states are the most important ones in Europe concerning the fields of chemistry and handling & processing for the applicant of the patent (e. g. the proprietor). In more than 70 % of the number of granted patents post grant in our empirical study DE, FR and GB are the designated states. But we also found that in several of the granted patents in our thesis, Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Switzerland (CH) and <b>Finland</b> (<b>FI)</b> are designated post grant. The numbers of designated states, post grant, in the scope of our thesis are higher compared with earlier studies applying the same method. For example Markus Reitzig’s empirical study that was made in 2004 uses 813 granted European patents, where the designation of DE, FR and GB was more significant and only 4 - 5 states on average were designated. It is an indication that the European market has extended the last 10 years within the fields of our study. The uniqueness of our empirical study comes from the survey of each of the 407 granted patents when it was filed at the European Patent Office (EPO) and after grant and publishing (post grant), i. e. {{at the beginning of the}} life cycle of the patent. As far as we know no earlier studies did so. Concerning our sample of applications for a European patent, the rational is the following. When the application is filed at EPO are all possible states designated, but post grant of the patent only a few state remains. Concerning the selection of the field of patenting, our consideration of data singularises chemistry and handling & processing. Clearly in the field of chemistry we found a marked incremental tendency for the transfer of patents rights. The transfer itself may be an indicator of a change either of industrial process toward R&D or a strategy toward patent policies in this specific field. The thesis tries consequently to evaluate if the EU-patent system will ease the commercialization of inventions in chemistry and handling´& processing in Europe. Especially for SMEs the EU-patent should facilitate a quicker and cheaper process. A general opinion assumes that the European patent application is too expensive for small companies. The process of establishing EU-patent was initiated 30 years ago and it will last another 5 years before it is fully possible to filing. Obviously, legal and political matters are not completely solved but that is not the direct concern of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Waste rocks (WRs) {{from coal}} mining and fly ash (FA) from coal {{combustion}} were studied {{to determine the}} potential of the WRs to generate AMD, FAs to neutralise it and estimate their impacts on environment. The ultimate goal was to develop a methodology based on co-disposal to mitigate the environmental problems associated to both wastes. Two methods for co-disposal were tested: i) Mixing WRs and FAs and ii) covering WRs with FAs. WRs were sampled from the Lakhra coal mines in Pakistan (PK), which has an estimated coal reserves of 1. 3 Btonne, varying from lignite to sub-bituminous quality. The FA was sampled from a power plant utilising coal from Lakhra coal mines and is situated in close vicinity (15 km) of the mine site. For comparative purposes a bituminous FA from <b>Finland</b> (<b>FI)</b> and biomass FA from Sweden (SE) were also characterised. The WRs and FA samples were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods. Besides organic material (coal traces), quartz, pyrite, kaolinite, hematite, gypsum and traces of calcite, lime, malladerite, spangolite, franklinite and birnessite were identified in WRs by XRD. The major elements Si, Al, Ca and Fe were in the range (wt. %) of 8 – 12, 6 – 9, 0. 3 – 3 and 1 – 10, respectively, with high S concentrations (1. 94 – 11. 33 wt. %) in WRs. The AMD potential of WRs ranged from - 70 to - 492 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1. All FAs contained quartz, with iron oxide, anhydrite and magnesioferrite in PK, mullite and lime in FI and calcite and anorthite in SE. The Ca content in SE was 6 and 8 times higher compared to PK and FI, respectively. FAs were enriched in As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn compared to continental crust. The acid neutralising potential of PK was equivalent to 20 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 compared to 275 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 (SE) and 25 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 (FI). During the period of 192 days in weathering cell experiments (WCE), the pH of leachates from most acidic WRs was maintained from 1 to 2. 5, whereas, the less acidic WRs produced leachates of mildly acidic (2. 7) to neutral (7. 3) pH. The leachates from very acidic WRs ranged in the concentrations of Fe, SO 24 − and Al from mg L- 1 to g L- 1. The samples were subjected to column leaching experiments (CLE) in which mixture (FA:WR; 1 : 3) and cover (FA:WR; 1 : 5) cases were mimicked (with 10 mm particle size) and effects of particle size (2, 5 and 10 mm) on element leaching were studied. Despite having the lowest acid-neutralisation potential compared to FI and SE, co-disposal of PKFA as mixture readily provides acid buffering minerals, resulting in better start-up pH conditions and leachate quality. However, acidity produced by secondary mineralisation contributes towards the acidification of the system, causing stabilisation of pH at around 4. 5 − 5. Secondary mineralisation (especially Fe- and Al-mineral precipitation) also removes toxic elements such as As, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, Ni and Mn, and these secondary minerals can also buffer acidity when the pH tends to be acidic. In contrast, the pH of the leachates from the PKFA cover scenario gradually increased from strongly acidic to mildly acidic and circumneutral along with decrease in EC and elemental leaching in different WRs. Gradually increasing pH {{can be attributed to the}} cover effect, which reduces oxygen ingress, thus sulphide oxidation, causing pH to elevate. Due to the fact that pH~ 4 – 5 is sufficient for secondary Fe- and Al-mineral precipitation which also removes toxic elements (such as Cd, Co, Cu, Zn and Ni) by adsorption and/or co-precipitation, the FA cover performs well enough to achieve that pH until the conclusion of the CLE. However, due to the slower reactivity of the buffering system (additional to the initial flush-out), leaching in the beginning could not be restricted. The co-disposal of FA as cover and/or mixture possesses potential for neutralisation of AMD and improving leachate quality significantly. Particle size of the WRs affected the leaching of the sulphide related elements (such as Fe, S, Zn, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni) in CLE and WCE. Experiments with ≤ 1 mm particle size constantly produced acidic and metal laden leachates. Co-disposal of FA and WRs as cover and mixture need to be investigated on pilot-scales before full-scale application...|$|R
