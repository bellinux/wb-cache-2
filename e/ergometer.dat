25|$|Recent {{research}} by Pedersen et al. indicates that TNFα increase {{in response to}} sepsis is inhibited by the exercise-induced production of myokines. To study whether acute exercise induces a true anti-inflammatory response, a model of ‘low grade inflammation’ was established in which a low dose of E. coli endotoxin was administered to healthy volunteers, who had been randomised to either rest or exercise prior to endotoxin administration. In resting subjects, endotoxin induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of TNFα. In contrast, when the subjects performed 3 hours of <b>ergometer</b> cycling and received the endotoxin bolus at 2.5 h, the TNFα response was totally blunted. This study provides some evidence that acute exercise may inhibit TNF production.|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{investigated}} the effect of cycling position (upright vs. recumbent) and seat position on the oxygen cost of cycling. Experimental design. A two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures {{was used to examine}} the effect of cycling position (Monark 814 E, Lifecycle 9100 R, and Lifecycle 9500 RHR <b>ergometers)</b> and seat position (optimum and +/- 1 setting) on VO 2 and HR. Participants. Subjects were 10 male physical education students (age = 24 +/- 2. 1 years, height = 178. 8 +/- 4. 8 cm, weight = 76. 2 +/- 7. 8 kg). Interventions. Each subject was tested at three 5 -minute workloads (55, 137, and 186 Watts) in a random order on the three <b>ergometers.</b> These workloads corresponded with manual settings of 1, 3, and 5 on the Lifecycle <b>ergometers.</b> The cycling protocols for the Lifecycle <b>ergometers</b> were performed with the seat set at 107 % of the symphysis pubis measurement and at seat positions of +/- 1 setting from the so-called "optimum" setting. Measures. Physiological response was assessed by continuously monitoring VO 2 and HR. Results. At the optimum seat setting, the VO 2 was significantly higher at the three workloads on the Monark compared to both Lifecycle <b>ergometers.</b> Seat positions of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting did not affect VO 2. The HR response was non-significant for cycling position and seat position. Conclusions. The results indicate that the Lifecycle <b>ergometers</b> (9100 R and 9500 RHR) underestimate oxygen consumption and indirectly underestimate energy expenditure. Seat positions of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting on the Lifecycle <b>ergometers</b> did not affect the VO 2...|$|R

50|$|Some rowing enthusiasts {{claim that}} the disproportionate number of tall rowers is simply due to the unfair {{advantage}} that tall rowers have on the <b>ergometer.</b> This {{is due to the}} ergometer's inability to properly simulate the larger rowers drag on a boat due to weight. Since the <b>ergometer</b> is used to assess potential rowers, results on the <b>ergometer</b> machine play a large role in a rower's career success. Thus, many erg scores are weight-adjusted, as heavyweights typically find it easier to get better erg scores. Also, since crew selection has favored tall rowers long before the advent of the <b>ergometer,</b> and bigger, taller crews are almost universally faster than smaller, shorter crews on the water, being tall is a definite advantage ultimately having {{little to do with the}} <b>ergometer.</b>|$|E

Ten specifically trained endurance individuals (S) (Five cross-country runners and five cyclists), and eight non-specifically trained individuals (NS) underwent a maximal oxygen uptake determination test (VO₂max) on both a CE and TE. Cardiorespiratory variables (VO₂max, VCO₂, RER, VE, VT, and ƒR) and movement frequency (MF), were collected and calculated relative to fixed percentages of VO₂max, ranging from 50 to 100 %.

Both the SR cycle and the AD showed the next highest values with most stages revealing equal responses to exercise.
