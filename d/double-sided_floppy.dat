5000|$|Sirjang Lal Tandon {{also known}} as [...] "Jugi" [...] Tandon, was born in India in 1942. He is {{chairman}} and CEO of Celetronix, Inc. He is known for leading his company, Tandon Corporation (originally Tandon Magnetics) in the disk drive industry, creating what became the industry-standard <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> drive disk read-and-write heads.|$|E
5000|$|JT Storage (also {{known as}} JTS Corporation, JTS Corp and JTS) was {{a maker of}} {{inexpensive}} IDE hard drives for personal computers based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1994 by [...] "Jugi" [...] Tandon - {{the inventor of the}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disk drive and founder of Tandon Corporation - and Tom Mitchell, a co-founder of Seagate and former president and Chief Operating Officer of both Seagate and Conner Peripherals.|$|E
50|$|The Model II was {{replaced}} in 1982 by the TRS-80 Model 12, which used half-height ("thinline") <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> drives, and integrated {{most of the}} Model II electronics into a single main board. The video/keyboard card plugged into a single slot in the main board. An expansion card cage was available as an option, allowing more plug-in cards. The Model 12 was essentially a Model 16B (described below) without the Motorola processor, and could be upgraded to a Model 16B.|$|E
50|$|Tandy in February 1982 {{released}} the TRS-80 Model 16, as the follow-on to the Model II; an upgrade kit {{was available for}} Model II systems. The Model 16 added a 6 MHz, 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor and memory card, keeping the original Z80 as an I/O processor. It had two half-height ("thinline") <b>double-sided</b> 8-inch <b>floppy</b> drives, though the Model II upgrade did not replace the floppy drive.|$|R
50|$|The Victor 9000/Sirius 1 ran CP/M-86 and MS-DOS but did {{not claim}} to be IBM PC compatible. It offered a higher {{resolution}} screen and 600 kB/1.2 MB floppy drives. Advertisements cited the graphics, multiple operating systems, 128 kB of RAM, and high-quality audio. One striking difference between it and other machines on the market {{at the time was}} the fact that the disc spun at different speeds according to where the data was stored, running slower towards the outer edge of the disc in such a way that bit density (bits per cm passing the head), rather than rotational speed, was approximately constant. This allowed standard floppy disks to hold more data than others at the time, 600 kB on single- and 1.2 MB on <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppies</b> compared with 140-160 kB per side of other machines such as the Apple II and early IBM PC, but disks made at constant bit density were not compatible with machines with standard drives. The Victor 9000's 800x400 resolution screen, 896 kB of memory (RAM), programmable keyboard and character set were also far ahead of the competition.|$|R
5000|$|The CMD FD {{series was}} Creative Micro Designs (CMD)'s range of {{third-party}} floppy disk drives for the Commodore 8-bit line of home computers. Using 3½" [...] floppy disks, they provided a significantly larger storage capacity than Commodore-produced drives; the FD-2000 offered 1600 kB of storage using standard <b>double-sided,</b> high-density <b>floppies,</b> while the FD-4000 also allowed {{the use of}} 3200 kB extra-high density (ED) floppies. In contrast, the Commodore 1581 3½" [...] drive only supported 800 kB double-sided, double-density disks.|$|R
5000|$|Tandon {{invented the}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> drive used by IBM in the IBM PC {{and worked as}} OEM {{manufacturer}} for Xerox, Tandem and Prime Computer. In late 1982, Tandon was #1 in the disk-drive industry, and his company was named Forbes magazine's [...] "Up and Comer of the Year". The $150-million value of his stock placed [...] "Jugi", at age 41, on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans. With this wealth, he built a 30-room home on 20 acres in Chatsworth.|$|E
50|$|Atari later {{upgraded}} {{the basic}} design in 1986 with the 1040STF (also written STF). The machine is generally {{similar to the}} earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> drive into {{the rear of the}} housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added {{to the size of the}} machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk drive now sat, were moved to a niche underneath the keyboard.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1980s, a 2.8-inch {{floppy disk}} drive, the Triton Disk Drive and Controller, was {{introduced}} by Radofin Electronics, Ltd. It was compatible with the Commodore 64 {{as well as other}} popular home computers of the time, thanks to an operating system stored on an EPROM on an external controller. It offered a capacity of 144/100 kilobytes non-formatted/formatted, and data transfer rates of up to 100 kilobytes per second. Up to 20 files could be kept {{on each side of the}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disks.|$|E
50|$|Eagles were {{marketed as}} {{business}} machines, so financial software {{had to be}} part of the package. Originally this was Accounting Plus, a professional bookkeeping system so large that it took six Eagle <b>double-sided</b> 784 kB <b>floppy</b> disks to hold it all, and required constant disk swapping on an Eagle without a hard disk.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM Personal Computer XT {{originally}} {{came with}} 128 KB of RAM, a 360 KB <b>double-sided</b> 5¼ inch <b>floppy</b> disk drive, a 10 MB Seagate ST-412 hard drive with Xebec 1210 Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM) controller, an Asynchronous Adapter (serial card with 8250 UART), and a 130-watt power supply. The motherboard had an Intel 8088 microprocessor running at 4.77 MHz, with a socket for an optional 8087 math coprocessor.|$|R
25|$|The first Macintosh {{computers}} used single-sided 3½-inch floppy disks, {{but with}} 400 KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by <b>double-sided</b> 800 KB <b>floppies.</b> The higher capacity was achieved {{at the same}} recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44 MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed.|$|R
50|$|Time Zone is a multi-disk {{graphical}} adventure game {{written and}} directed by Roberta Williams for the Apple II. Developed in 1981 and released in 1982 by On-Line Systems (later Sierra Entertainment), the game was shipped with six <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disks and contained 1,500 areas (screens) to explore along with 39 scenarios to solve. Produced {{at a time when most}} games rarely took up more than one side of a floppy, Time Zone is one of the very first games of this magnitude ever released for home computer systems.|$|E
50|$|Coherent was {{originally}} {{written for the}} PDP-11 range of minicomputers in 1980, then ported to various early 1980s microcomputer systems including IBM PC compatibles and machines based on the Zilog Z8000 and Motorola 68000. Initially sold to OEMs, starting 1983 it was available on the consumer market from MWC directly. At this point, Coherent 2.3 offered roughly the functionality of Version 7 Unix on PC hardware, including the nroff formatter but not the BSD extensions offered by competing Unix/clone vendors; compared to its competitors, {{it was a small}} system distributed on only seven <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disks, costing only US$500 for a license.|$|E
50|$|FileWare drives are 5¼-inch double-sided, {{but are not}} {{mechanically}} {{compatible with}} industry-standard diskettes. In a single-sided floppy disk drive, the disk head is opposed by a foam pressure pad. In a normal <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disk drive, {{the top and bottom}} heads are almost directly opposed to each other. Apple was concerned about head wear, and instead designed the FileWare drive such that the top and bottom heads are {{on opposite sides of the}} spindle, and each is opposed by a pressure pad. Since there is only one actuator to move the heads, when one head is near the spindle, the other is near the outer rim of the disk.|$|E
5000|$|The Commodore 1581 is a 3½-inch <b>double-sided</b> double-density <b>floppy</b> {{disk drive}} that was {{released}} by Commodore Business Machines (CBM) in 1987, primarily for its C64 and C128 home/personal computers. The drive stores 800 kilobytes using an MFM encoding but format different from MS-DOS (720 kB), Amiga (880 kB), and Mac Plus (800 kB) formats. With special software it's possible to read C1581 disks on an x86 PC system, and likewise, read MS-DOS and other formats of disks in the C1581 (using Big Blue Reader), provided that the PC or other floppy handles the [...] "720 kB" [...] size format. This capability was most frequently used to read MS-DOS disks. The drive was released {{in the summer of}} 1987 and quickly became popular with bulletin board system (BBS) operators and other users.|$|R
5000|$|The Korg X3 is a {{synthesizer}} music workstation {{produced by}} Korg in 1993. The X3 features 200 programs, 200 combinations, 32-voice polyphony, a 32,000 note, 16-track sequencer with 100 patterns and 10 songs and a <b>double-sided,</b> double-density 3.5-inch <b>floppy</b> disk drive for song {{and other data}} storage types. Korg also released the X2 (76-key) with 8 Mbyte ROM (6Mbyte X3 + 2Mbyte new piano) in 1994 along with a rackmount version dubbed the X3R, which also had a floppy disk drive.|$|R
50|$|It {{has what}} was then a new 3.5-inch <b>double-sided</b> 800 KB <b>floppy</b> drive, {{offering}} double the capacity of floppy disks for previous Macs, along with backward compatibility. The then-new drive is controlled by the same IWM chip as in previous models, implementing variable speed GCR. The drive was still completely incompatible with PC drives. The 800 KB drive has two read/write heads, enabling it to simultaneously use both sides of the floppy disk and thereby double storage capacity. Like the 400 KB drive before it, a companion Macintosh 800K External Drive was an available option. However, with the increased storage capacity combined with 2-4x the available RAM, the external drive was less of a necessity than it had been with the 128K and 512K.|$|R
5000|$|The Disk System's Disk Cards are {{somewhat}} proprietary 71 mm × 76 mm (2.8 × 3 in) 56K-per-side <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy.</b> These [...] "Disk Cards," [...] {{as they are}} officially called, were a slight modification of Mitsumi's [...] "Quick Disk" [...] 89 mm 2.8 in square disk format which is used {{in a handful of}} Japanese computers and various synthesizer keyboards, along with a few word processors. Some of the QuickDisk drives even made it into devices in Europe and North America, though they {{are somewhat}} rare. Mitsumi already had close relations with Nintendo, as it manufactured the Famicom and NES consoles, and possibly other Nintendo hardware.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Lisa, or Lisa 1, had two Apple FileWare 5.25-inch <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disk drives, {{more commonly}} known by Apple's internal code {{name for the}} drive, [...] "Twiggy". They had a capacity of approximately 871 kB each, but proved unreliable and required special diskettes. The Macintosh, which was intended to implement a single Twiggy drive partway through development, was revised to use a Sony 400 kB microfloppy drive. An optional external 5 MB or, later, a 10 MB Apple ProFile hard drive (originally designed for the Apple III) was available. With {{the introduction of the}} Lisa 2/10, an optional 10 MB internal proprietary hard disk manufactured by Apple, known as the [...] "Widget", was also offered.|$|E
50|$|To do this, Atari {{engineers}} {{were able to}} add {{a number of new}} IC's to take over the functions of many of those remaining in the 1200XL. This resulted in an even simpler main PCB design, and slightly smaller cases to house it. A new lineup was announced at the 1983 Summer CES, closely following the original Liz/Sweet concepts. The 600XL was essentially the Liz NY model, and the spiritual replacement for the 400, while the 800XL would replace both the 800 and 1200XL. The machines looked similar to the 1200XL, but were smaller back to front, the 600 being somewhat smaller as it lacked one row of memory chips on the PCB. The high-end 1400XL added a built-in 300 baud modem and a voice synthesizer, and the 1450XLD also included a built-in <b>double-sided</b> <b>floppy</b> disk drive in an enlarged case, with a slot for a second drive. The machines had Atari BASIC built into the ROM of the computer and the PBI at the back that allowed external expansion.|$|E
5000|$|The Commodore 1571 is Commodore's {{high-end}} 5¼" [...] {{floppy disk}} drive. With its double-sided drive mechanism, {{it has the}} ability to use <b>double-sided,</b> double-density (DS/DD) <b>floppy</b> disks natively. This is in contrast to its predecessors, the 1541 and 1570, which can fully read and write such disks only if the user manually flipped them over to access the second side. Because flipping the disk also reverses the direction of rotation, the two methods are not interchangeable; disks which had their back side created in a 1541 by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the 1571 too, and the back side of disks written in a 1571 using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a 1541.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{renamed the}} Apple SuperDrive (G7287), the Apple FDHD Drive (Floppy Disk High Density) was {{introduced}} in 1989 as Apple's first external 1.44MB high density <b>double-sided</b> 3.5" [...] <b>floppy</b> drive. It supported all of Apple's 3.5" [...] floppy disk formats {{as well as all}} standard PC formats (e.g. MS-DOS, Windows), allowing the Macintosh to read and write all industry standard floppy disk formats. The external drive was offered only briefly with support for the Apple II, coming late in that product's life. To take advantage of the drive's extended storage and new capabilities, it required the new SWIM (Sander-Wozniak Integrated Machine) floppy disk controller chip to be present on the Macintosh and Apple II, the latter requiring the Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller Card which integrated the chip. If the drive was connected to an older Macintosh, Apple IIGS or Apple IIc Plus with the older IWM (Integrated Woz Machine) chip, the drive would act as a standard 800K drive, without any additional capabilities. The interface card was necessary for the Apple IIGS to make use of its greater storage capacity and ability to handle PC formats. The Apple IIe could not utilize the drive in any form, unless it had the specialized interface card installed, much like the UniDisk 3.5 which the SuperDrive replaced. The last Mac it could be used with was the Classic II and was discontinued shortly thereafter. The drive was fitted in every desktop Mac from its introduction and was eliminated with the introduction of the iMac in 1998. PowerPC Macs dropped the original auto-inject Sony drives and went to a manual eject mechanism.|$|R
