25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E

500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions), as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD). From his horological treatise, Su Song states: ...|$|E
500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the electrical {{length of the}} coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided <b>for</b> <b>coupling.</b> [...] To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. [...] It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E
500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> factors looser than low coupling also requires narrow tracks. [...] Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for [...] hybrids. [...] Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as coupled lines. [...] This style of coupler is good for implementing in high-power, air dielectric, solid bar formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support.Matthaei et al., pp.809–811Räisänen and Lehto, p.127 ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the results}} of the polls were printed in the March 2004 issue, {{the rules of the game}} had been changed from the {{original}} concept, showing that readers wanted to focus on the relationships between the girls, and in this respect, the readers could vote on who they wanted to be coupled together. The number of votes for this first round were less than 2000. Noting this, the editorial staff lifted the restriction on only coupling within the same school, along with the restriction of only allowing the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna to couple. This resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between the twelve characters in the series. In this issue, it was explained that four events were planned for the stories that followed: Easter, Athletic Carnival, Cultural Festival, and Christmas Bazaar. The [...] "Etoile" [...] title was born in this issue, which was initially used to crown the best couple voted first by the readers in each of the four events to follow. These events were going to be carried out by the three schools in cooperation. It became such that the planning of the schools resulted in them in a triangle position, having the dormitories at the center. The reader's position as the elder brother was canceled in this issue, and the game became a simple popularity vote <b>for</b> <b>coupling.</b> Due to this new system, Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna ceased to be sisters; surnames were later added to clarify this. After the first story arc of the short stories concluded, it was shown that the number of votes had increased sharply due to the new voting mechanisms. The Etoile voting was announced in the July 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been the case beforehand. The deadline for voting was shifted to the middle of every month, and online voting was introduced. In September 2004, the voting for the next Etoile was shifted to be online-only; the voting for the Dormitory Panic arc became mail voting only.|$|E

2500|$|Occasionally, small peaks {{can be seen}} {{shouldering}} {{the main}} 1H NMR peaks. [...] These peaks are {{not the result of}} proton-proton coupling, but result from the coupling of 1H atoms to an adjoining carbon-13 (13C) atom. These small peaks are known as carbon satellites as they are small and appear around the main 1H peak i.e. satellite (around) to them. [...] Carbon satellites are small because only very few of the molecules in the sample have that carbon as the rare NMR-active 13C isotope. As always <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> due to a single spin-1/2 nucleus, the signal splitting for the H attached to the 13C is a doublet. The H attached to the more abundant 12C is not split, so it is a large singlet. The net result is a pair of evenly spaced small signals around the main one. If the H signal would already be split due to H–H coupling or other effects, each of the satellites would also reflect this coupling as well (as usual for complex splitting patterns due to dissimilar coupling partners). Other NMR-active nuclei can also cause these satellites, but carbon is most common culprit in the proton NMR spectra of organic compounds.|$|E
