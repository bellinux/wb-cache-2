500|$|Reculver Country Park is {{a nature}} reserve managed by Canterbury City Council and the Kent Wildlife Trust. It covers [...] and {{comprises}} a {{narrow strip of}} protected, cliff-top land about [...] long, running from the remaining enclosure of the Roman fort west to Bishopstone Glen. Most of the cliff-top {{and all of the}} foreshore in this area are included in the Thanet Coast SSSI, the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay SPA and the similarly named Ramsar site; most of the Country Park is also part of the Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve, which covers [...] of the coastline between Beltinge and Reculver. In winter brent geese and wading birds such as sanderlings and turnstones may be seen; during the summer months the largest colony of sand martins in Kent nests in the soft cliffs, on top of which fulmars were also reported to have begun nesting in 2013, and wading curlews may be seen at any time. The grasslands on the cliff top are among the few remaining cliff-top wildflower meadows left in Kent, and are home to butterflies and skylarks. Also present are the nationally scarce hog's fennel and two species of <b>digger</b> <b>wasp,</b> Alysson lunicornis and Ectemnius ruficornis. The coastline here forms part of the [...] "key on-land Palaeocene site in the London Basin", and is the only location in the Woolwich Beds to contain wood. The foreshore displays a [...] "rich invertebrate and vertebrate fossil fauna... and the section has been extensively studied over many years." [...] The park first won a Green Flag Award in 2005, and it is estimated that over 200,000people visit it each year, including up to 3,500students for educational trips. Canterbury City Council's Reculver Masterplan envisages purchasing farmland to the south of the country park to replace land lost to the sea through coastal erosion.|$|E
2500|$|P. gibbosus {{is notable}} {{in that it}} stings its prey in a {{membranous}} location on the ventral surface of the abdomen where the venom is quick to incapacitate many major, voluntary muscles. The paralyzing effect of the injected venom is likely due largely {{in part to a}} block of the somatic neuromuscular transmission. It has also been established that the venom is not limited exclusively to the natural prey, the honey bee, but also in many other insect species belonging to different orders, including spiders. Only P. triangulum [...] itself and a <b>digger</b> <b>wasp</b> that preys on P. triangulum are immune to the venom. However, the sting does not kill the prey. The prey may attempt to sting in return, but P. gibbosus always grabs the prey {{in such a way that}} the well-armored portions of the body are presented, thus protecting P. gibbosus from a retaliation by the prey. P. gibbosus then carries its paralyzed prey back to an oval cell in its nest for temporary storage until it is later used in the laying of an egg.|$|E

40|$|Published sources {{document}} a loss {{of biodiversity}} at an extreme rate, mainly because natural and semi-natural ecosystems are becoming fragmented and isolated, thus losing their biological functions. These changes significantly influence biological diversity, which is a complex phenomenon that changes over time. Contemporary ecologists must therefore draw attention to anthropogenic replacement habitats and increase their conservation status. In our studies we show the positive role of soda ash dumping grounds as an alternative habitat for <b>digger</b> <b>wasps,</b> especially the thermophilic species. In the years 2007 - 2010 we carried out investigations in postindustrial soda ash dumping grounds located in Central Poland. We demonstrated that these areas serve as replacement habitats for thermophilic species of Spheciformes and, indirectly, for their potential prey. The studies were conducted in three microhabitat types, varying in soil moisture, salinity and alkalinity, that were changing {{in the course of}} ecological succession. We trapped 2571 specimens belonging to 64 species of <b>digger</b> <b>wasps.</b> Species typical of open sunny spaces comprised 73 % of the whole inventory. The obtained results suggest that the stage of succession determines the richness, abundance and diversity of Spheciformes. The most favorable conditions for <b>digger</b> <b>wasps</b> were observed in habitats at late successional stages. Our results clearly showed that these habitats were replacement habitats for thermophilous Spheciformes, including rare taxa that require genetic, species and ecosystem protection, according to the Biodiversity Convention. We showed that some types of industry might play a positive role in the preservation of taxa in the landscape, and that even degraded industrial wasteland can replace habitats under anthropopressure, serving as refugia of biological diversity, especially for disturbance-dependent species...|$|R

5000|$|Dawkins first recounts {{a famous}} {{religious}} dilemma experienced by Charles Darwin, [...] "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars." [...] We ask why a caterpillar should suffer such cruel punishment. We ask why <b>digger</b> <b>wasps</b> couldn't first kill caterpillars {{to save them}} from a prolonged and agonizing torture.

50|$|Dawkins opens {{by talking}} how organisms “grow up” to {{understand}} the universe around them, which requires certain apparatus, such as a brain. But before brains can become large enough to model the universe they must develop from intermediate forms. Dawkins then discusses the <b>digger</b> <b>wasp</b> and the set of experiments conducted by Nikolaas Tinbergen of how the <b>digger</b> <b>wasp</b> models the local geography around its nest. He then talks about {{the limitations of the}} digger wasps’ brain and concludes that only the human brain is sufficiently developed to model large-scale phenomena about the world. He then shows a MRI scan of a human brain (later revealed to be his own brain) and describes how an image develops from the eye onto the visual cortex.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Howard E. Evans {{published}} {{a study of}} the nesting behaviour of Sphecini <b>digger</b> <b>wasps,</b> showing a range of ways of stocking their nests. In Prionyx, several Nearctic and Palaearctic species catch a grasshopper, and then dig a nest for it, so there is one prey per nest. The nest consists of a single cell, and the egg is laid touching the coxa of a hind leg. In contrast, a Neotropical species, P. spinolae, digs the nest first, creating multiple cells, and stocks each cell with 5-10 grasshoppers; the egg is laid {{on the underside of the}} thorax.|$|R
25|$|L. geometricus is {{slightly}} smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color {{can range from}} tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking {{on the underside of}} the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs.

40|$|Specialist feeders {{face the}} {{important}} prob-lem of periodic drastic reductions in their resources. Specialized organisms cannot replace their exploited resource {{with a new}} one if the spe-cialization is fixed genetically. For example, some oligolectic bees can shift from the preferred pollen source to another if the 1 st becomes rare, but other more-specialized bees have co-evolved with only 1 plant and cannot survive without it (monolecty) (Wcislo 1996). Parasites face the same problems if they are specialized in their host use (Frank 1993). <b>Digger</b> <b>wasps</b> (Hymenoptera: Apoidea and Vespoidea) are characterized, in most cases, by a specialized diet in the larval stage (O Neill 2001).

We also report detections of A. planipennis by C. fumipennis in Illinois, New York and Ontario; all of which were made after it was known the beetle was in the area.

50|$|Chrysis ignita {{has been}} {{observed}} to parasitize {{a wide variety of}} wasps. Their most common host are from the family Eumenidae, or potter wasps, a cosmopolitan wasp that builds its nests from mud. Their second most preferred host are Megachilidae, or mason and leafcutter bees. Megachilidae nests are usually built in natural or artificial cavities, sometimes embedded in wood, clay, or attached to a plant surface. Although not as frequently, Chrysis ignita also parasitizes Sphecidae (<b>digger</b> <b>wasps,</b> whose nests are burrows in the ground), Colletidae (polyester bees, which build nests from cellophane-like saliva secretion), and very rarely, one species of Vespidae. The commonality among all these hosts, except the one species of Vespidae is that they are all solitary wasps. One can imagine {{it would be difficult for}} a cuckoo wasp to infiltrate the nest of a eusocial wasp, filled with tens of worker wasps guarding the nest and tending to food supplies and the larval nursery cells.|$|R

40|$|Future {{planning}} {{is the ability}} to anticipate future motivational needs (e. g., hunger) and take steps in the present to satisfy these needs. According to the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis, only humans can plan for the future: animals cannot anticipate a future motivational need beyond the one they are currently experiencing. Food-caching behaviour is future-oriented in that its benefits are not experienced until recovery, days if not weeks later. Yet, {{there are a number of}} behaviours that are prospective in nature but do not require cognition, from nest provisioning by <b>digger</b> <b>wasps</b> to the migratory orientation of black-capped warblers. In the case of corvids such as the western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica) however, there is evidence that their cache-recovery behaviour involves complex cognitive processes. For example, these birds form episodic-like memories of previous caching episodes and keep track of the social context of caching. The objective of this experiment was to test whether or not the caching behaviour of scrub-jays is mediated by prospective cognition. The present experiment consisted of two trials.

40|$|Increased {{vulnerability}} to predation while copulating is an often-touted cost of reproduction, but empirical data on such costs are rare. Here, I demonstrate a predation cost to mating in the wild, as levied by parasitoid <b>digger</b> <b>wasps</b> (Sphex cognatus) on {{a population of}} Australian plague locusts (Chortoicetes terminifera). In December 2010, brood-provisioning female S. cognatus were observed capturing, parasitizing, and burying locusts in southeastern Australia. Wasps caught 43 solo locusts, {{all of which were}} female, and 19 copulating pairs. This frequency of pair captures (30. 6 %) was over one order of magnitude greater than expected based on the relative availability of in copula locusts throughout the hunting environment (< 3. 0 % of total locust counts). Only females in captured pairs were ever paralyzed, and although males remained active, they were trapped in coitus and buried alive in 18 cases. These data indicate that copulation magnified the instantaneous risk of wasp-mediated death by ∼ 10 % (in absolute terms). Such an increase could pose an evolutionarily relevant cost to mating, especially if it is levied early in an individual's adult reproductive lifespan. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Solitary wasps paralyze insects or spiders with {{stinging}} venom {{and feed}} the paralyzed preys to their larva. Accordingly, the venoms should contain a variety of constituents acting on nervous systems. However, only a few solitary wasp venoms have been chemically studied despite thousands of species inhabiting the planet. We have surveyed bioactive substances in solitary wasp venoms found in Japan and discovered a variety of novel bioactive peptides. Pompilidotoxins (PMTXs), in the venoms of the pompilid wasps Anoplius samariensis and Batozonellus maculifrons, are small peptides consisting of 13 amino acids without a disulfide bond. PMTXs slowed Na+ channel inactivation, in particular against neuronal type Na+ channels, and were rather selective to the Nav 1. 6 channel. Mastoparan-like cytolytic and antimicrobial peptides are the major components of eumenine wasp venoms. They are rich in hydrophobic and basic amino acids, adopting a α-helical secondary structure, and showing mast cell degranulating, antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. The venom of the spider wasp Cyphononyx fulvognathus contained four bradykinin-related peptides. They are hyperalgesic and, dependent on the structure, differently associated with B 1 or B 2 receptors. Further survey led to the isolation of leucomyosuppressin-like FMRFamide peptides from the venoms of the <b>digger</b> <b>wasps</b> Sphex argentatus and Isodontia harmandi.
