25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, {{one or more of the}} women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E
25|$|At 10:41, {{a second}} caller {{reported}} the incident, and {{was transferred to}} the State Police. At 10:55, Roberts was reaching the final stages of his plan. He had arranged the bound girls {{at the front of the}} classroom, near the chalkboard. Roberts made two cell phone calls, one to his wife and the next to police. He warned the 911 dispatcher that if state police were not off the property in two seconds, he would kill the children. The dispatcher attempted to delay him and put him in touch with the State Police, but Roberts ended the call. Two of the girls then began negotiating with Roberts. They pleaded for him to shoot them first. This allowed the girls a little extra time for possible rescue. At approximately 11:07a.m., Roberts followed through with his threats and the sound of rapid gunfire was heard. At 10:58, Mrs. Roberts called 911 after arriving home from a prayer study group meeting. She had discovered a suicide note left on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> had received a brief and disturbing emotional phone call from her husband. The 911 dispatcher put her in touch with State Police.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2010 CMT Music Awards, held in June, Swift {{encountered}} an ex-boyfriend of hers. The {{two were}} seated {{a couple of}} seats away from each other, but were unwilling to speak to each other, although they both had much to say. As a result, they both pretended to be heavily engaged in conversations with those surrounding them, individuals who Swift noted to be practically strangers. Swift had the desire to confront him and ask him if the experience was as painful for him {{as it was for}} her. However, she did not do so because they both had [...] "silent shields up". [...] "We're sitting six seats away from each other and just fighting this silent war of ‘I don't care that you're here.' I don't care that you're here.' It's so terribly, heartbreakingly awkward", she said. She recalled it to be a miserable experience. When Swift arrived home, she spoke to her mother about the encounter, sitting at her <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room." [...] She then stood up and ran towards her bedroom to compose [...] "The Story of Us", something Swift's mother was already accustomed to. [...] "The Story of Us" [...] was the last track Swift composed for Speak Now, claiming that upon completing the song she knew she was done with the album. The song's subject was revealed by Swift to be the same for [...] "Dear John", which in an interview musician John Mayer confirmed that he was the song's subject. Furthermore, Swift and Mayer both attended the 2010 CMT Awards.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1984, Eastman and Laird self-published {{the first}} black & white issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The forty-page {{oversized}} comic had an initial print run of 3275 copies and was largely funded by a US$1000 loan from Eastman's uncle Quentin. It was published by the duo's Mirage Studios, a name chosen because, as Eastman says, [...] "there wasn't an actual studio, only <b>kitchen</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> couches with lap boards." [...] By September 1985, their first issue had received three additional printings.|$|R

60|$|The {{strain on}} Mr. Bashwood's mind was {{beginning}} to tell. Something of the helplessness which he had shown at the station appeared again {{in his face and}} manner as he put his teapot on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> sat down.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed his}} candle on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> made a bee-line for the pantry door, {{from where he}} {{subsequently}} emerged with two pounds of cold beef on a plate and about a quart of beer in a jug; and I came away, leaving him fumbling for pickles.|$|E

40|$|They {{stared out}} from lounge-room walls, and fridges; from {{telegraph}} poles and shop windows. They were devised in daylight and the dark, on photocopiers <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> printed by hand {{for free or}} by some inky guy for money. Posters were essential to {{having a good time}} in Brisbane through the 70 s and 80 s. They started word of mouth, and they amplified it – sending the word about these bands across the river, up and down the streets of this sleepy town; catching the eye just as the bands caught the ear and the heart. But after this primary job was done, people held onto them – evidence of a life lived, the wallpapers of memory...|$|R
5000|$|In May 1984, Laird and Kevin Eastman self-published {{the first}} black & white issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, at an initial print run of 3000 copies for the forty-page {{oversized}} comic. It was largely funded by a loan from Eastman's uncle, Quentin (the experience of which {{had a profound impact}} on Laird, and led indirectly to his later work with the Xeric Foundation), and published by the duo's Mirage Studios, a name chosen because [...] "there wasn’t an actual studio, only <b>kitchen</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> couches with lap boards."

60|$|Twenty {{feet from}} the bored Carters was tragedy. Gray-faced, dumb, Father stood by Mother's chair, {{stroking}} her dull hair as she laid {{her head on the}} crude <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> sobbed. Mechanically, back and forth, back and forth, his hand passed over her dear, comfortable head, while he listened, even as, on the stairs to the guillotine, a gallant gentleman of old France might have caressed his marquise.|$|E
50|$|South Shore Furniture is a North American {{furniture}} manufacturer {{with over}} 700 employees working in three plants: two in Canada {{and one in}} Mexico.Before he founded Industries de la Rive Sud, Eugène Laflamme bought out a bankrupt wooden toy manufacturing company called Atelier Pierre et Jean de Sainte-Croix-de-Lotbinière, in 1940. The seasonal nature of the toy market prompted Mr. Laflamme to go into another line of business: manufacturing <b>kitchen</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> chairs made of wood. The factory was damaged by fire twice - in 1941 and again in 1951 - and rebuilt, both times, on the same site. The advent of chrome kitchen furniture shortly thereafter, in 1952, led {{to a decline in}} demand for wood <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> chairs, so the company gradually moved into the production of bedroom furniture.|$|R

60|$|The {{dance at}} Byron Lyall's {{was in full}} swing. Toff Leclerc, the best fiddler in three counties, was enthroned on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> from the glossy brown violin, which his {{grandfather}} brought from Grand Pré, was conjuring music which made even stiff old Aunt Phemy want to show her steps. Around the kitchen sat a row {{of young men and}} women, and the open sitting-room doorway was crowded with the faces of non-dancing guests who wanted to watch the sets.|$|E
60|$|The present was an {{elaborate}} hatrack of polished buffalo horns, mounted on red plush, with an inset mirror. Young Thomas {{set it up}} on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> scowled moodily at his reflection in the mirror. If wedding presents were beginning to come, it was high time something was done. The matter was past being a joke. This affair of the present would certainly get out--things always got out in Valley View, dang it all--and he would never hear the last of it.|$|E

60|$|We got {{but little}} variety {{in the way}} of food at that <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> there wasn't enough of it anyway. So we {{apprentices}} used to keep alive by arts of our own--that is to say, we crept into the cellar nearly every night, by a private entrance which we had discovered, and we robbed the cellar of potatoes and onions and such things, and carried them down-town to the printing-office, where we slept on pallets on the floor, and cooked them at the stove and had very good times.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} a week after the boys' hunting trip when Mr. Oliver's nearest neighbor, Mr. Webster, drove up to the ranch in a {{dilapidated}} wagon. It was dark when he arrived, for the days were rapidly getting shorter. When Jake had taken his horse away he laid {{what appeared to be a}} small armory on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> sat down by the stove. He was a young man with a careless, good-humored expression, and Harry aside informed Frank that his ranch was not much of a place.|$|E
