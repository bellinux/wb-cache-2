K0GRL is still the call sign of the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club. He was famous <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the air on amateur bands while flying on board SAC bombers. LeMay became aware that the new single sideband (SSB) technology offered a big advantage over amplitude modulation (AM) for SAC aircraft operating long distances from their bases. In conjunction with Heath engineers and Art Collins (W0CXX) of Collins Radio, he established SSB as the radio standard for SAC bombers in 1957.|$|E

500|$|Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims {{was one of}} 12 children. The family soon {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, [...] "It was just a whole big dancing family." [...] He learned to dance from his father, {{and said he was}} dancing as soon as he could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> that street was legitimate.|$|E

500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{judicial}} inquiry {{known as the}} Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was formed to investigate {{the causes of the}} collision. Proceedings began at the Halifax Court House on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry's report of 4 February 1918 blamed Mont-Blancs captain, Aimé Le Médec, the ship's pilot, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. Drysdale agreed with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L.A. Demers' opinion that [...] "it was the Mont-Blancs responsibility alone to ensure that she avoided a collision at all costs" [...] given her cargo; he was likely influenced by local opinion, which was strongly anti-French, {{as well as by the}} [...] "street fighter" [...] style of argumentation used by Imo lawyer Charles Burchell. According to Crown counsel W.A. Henry, this was [...] "a great surprise to most people", who had expected the Imo to be blamed <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the wrong side of the channel. All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. However, a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice, Benjamin Russell found there was no evidence to support these charges. Mackey was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus and the charges dropped. The charges against Le Médec were also dismissed. This left only Wyatt to face a grand jury hearing. On 17 April 1918, a jury acquitted him in a trial that lasted less than a day.|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] is {{prominently}} an electropop {{song that}} is also composed {{of a number of}} hooks, which yell the song's title, while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars. Unlike other songs on Breakout, [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] has Cyrus' voice processed to sound different. The song's lyrics taunt [...] "the listener <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the outside of her inner sanctum". The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex-boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to. [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music. The backdrop for the [...] "feel-bad" [...] love song features ocean wave sounds. The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention". In the first verse, she [...] "admits that she doesn't know exactly what's up with this global warming but believes there's something we should all do about it". [...] "These Four Walls" [...] is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative. [...] "Simple Song" [...] has [...] "bile" [...] sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person [...] "can't tell which way is up, which way is down" [...] and they feel the need to alienate themselves. In [...] "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more [...] "roosty" [...] with a more [...] "natural-sounding accompaniment" [...] while, in the lyrics, she finds her remembering the [...] "simple things ... until [...]" [...] "See You Again" [...] (Rock Mafia Remix) is dance-pop number, fusing sultry vocals with techno beats. The track has Cyrus detailing previous scenes and plans to redeem herself.|$|E

500|$|Mrs. Roosevelt {{also made}} {{extensive}} use of radio. [...] She {{was not the first}} First Lady to broadcast—her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done that already. But Mrs. Hoover did not have a regular radio program, whereas Mrs. Roosevelt did. [...] She first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on [...] July 9, 1934. On that first show, she talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and her opinion about the recent All-Star baseball game. [...] She also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored the broadcast. [...] She said she would not accept any salary <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the air, and that she would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity. [...] Later that year, in November 1934, she broadcast a series of programs about children's education; it was heard on the CBS Radio Network. Sponsored by a typewriter company, Mrs. Roosevelt once again donated the money, giving it to the American Friends Service Committee, to help with a school it operated. [...] During 1934, Eleanor Roosevelt set a record for the most times a First Lady had spoken on radio: she spoke as a guest on other people's programs, as well as the host of her own, for a total of 28 times that year. [...] In 1935, Mrs. Roosevelt continued to host programs aimed at the female audience, including one called [...] "It's A Woman's World." [...] Each time, she donated the money she earned to charity. [...] The association of a sponsor with the popular First Lady resulted in increases in sales for that company: when the Selby Shoe Company sponsored a series of Eleanor Roosevelt's programs, sales increased by 200%. [...] The fact that her programs were sponsored created controversy, with her husband's political enemies expressing skepticism about whether she really did donate her salary to charity; they accused her of [...] "profiteering." [...] But her radio programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect. She continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s, sometimes on CBS and sometimes on NBC.|$|E
