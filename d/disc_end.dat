40|$|Coupling {{coefficients}} for the APT superconducting cavity couplers have been predicted using an improvement of the method previously developed for the French Trispal project [1]. We here present the method and a proof of the formula used to compute the external Q. Measurements on a single-cell copper cold model exhibited a very good agreement against simulation. Then, we established that the original coupler design lead to an insufficient coupling in β= 0. 64 cavities. Different solutions were proposed to fix this problem, like combining impedance discontinuities in the line and an off-centered <b>disc</b> <b>end</b> tip.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the GAL 4 -UAS {{expression}} system to increase the level of expression of theDrosophilagenedecapentaplegic(dpp) in a pattern approximating its normal pattern in leg and wing imaginal discs. Intermediate increases ofdppexpression have little effect in wing discs but high levels ofdppoverexpression lead to reduction of the scutellum and duplication of posterior wing structures. In leg discs intermediate increases cause supernumerary outgrowths of ventral leg structures in the anterior–ventral region. Greater increases ofdppexpression cause the loss of ventral leg structures with the concomitant fusion of left and right dorsal forelegs. The defects observed in both legs and wings appear to arise through dose-dependent effects ofdpponwingless(wg) expression. A high level ofdppoverexpression in the wing disc causes reduction ofwgexpression in the presumptive scutellar region, consistent with the subsequent reduction of the scutellum. An intermediate increase ofdppexpression in leg discs induces the expansion ofwgexpression into the ventral outgrowths. At higherdppexpression levels, ventralwgexpression in leg discs is eliminated, consistent {{with the loss of}} ventral leg cuticle. In the leg <b>disc</b> <b>end</b> knob and in the wing margin primordium, wherewganddppcooperate in producing distal outgrowth,dppoverexpression has no detectable effect either on patterning or onwgexpression. We propose that a critical role fordppin other regions of the leg and wing discs is to reduce or block the expression ofwg. This role ofdppis supported by the observation that ectopicwgexpression is detected in imaginal discs wheredppsignaling is compromised by lowering the activity of one of its receptors,tkv. This antagonism betweendppandwgexpression may be critical to assigning only one disc region as the distal organizer...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty {{with use}} of {{polymethylmethacrylate}} cement is gaining popularity {{in the treatment of}} some specific painful lesions of the spine. It remains unclear, however, what possible side effects this type of cement might have upon the vertebral body. We performed a histologic and radiographic analysis of the end plate and disc to determine whether there was a difference between vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate cement and vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement in the surrounding tissue of the goat spine. Furthermore, we assessed whether a defect in the end plate, simulating end-plate fracture and allowing for direct contact of cement with disc tissue, had any effect on end-plate or disc degeneration. METHODS: Twenty-four mature goats were divided between two follow-up periods (six weeks and six months). All animals underwent a bilateral transpedicular vertebroplasty at two lumbar levels, where one of the following treatments was applied: vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement with or without an end-plate defect, and vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate cement with or without an end-plate defect. The effect of the various treatments on the integrity of the intervertebral <b>disc,</b> <b>end</b> plate, and surrounding tissue was examined with semiquantitative histologic analysis and radiography. RESULTS: No sign of disc or end-plate degeneration was seen in any of the analyzed sections. The mean disc height did not decrease from the postoperative period to the time that the animals were killed in any group, thereby supporting the histologic findings. A mild inflammatory reaction was found in four vertebral bodies in the polymethylmethacrylate groups only. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium phosphate cement and polymethylmethacrylate cement both seem to be adequate bone-void fillers in terms of biological behavior in the vertebral body...|$|E
