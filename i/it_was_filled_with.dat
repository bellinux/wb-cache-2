5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|While {{anchored}} off the Galápagos, Beebe and {{his crew}} noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, {{and set out to}} investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption, and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava, or drawing too close to it in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.|$|E

The bomb was usually filled {{with a mixture of}} 40% amatol and 60% TNT, but when used as an anti-shipping bomb <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminium powder. A central exploder tube of high grade TNT was put down the centre of the explosive to ensure high order detonation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the spring}} of 2009, parts of the ship's rear outer decks areas were rebuilt into an indoor dance bar. All {{conversion}} work was carried out while the ship remained in normal service. Originally the Red Rose bar {{in the front of}} the ship was projected to be a dance restaurant, but in practice <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> diners eating food purchased from the ship's cafeteria. With the addition of the dance bar Viking Line hoped to attract more cruise passengers that sailed with the ships of competing Tallink and Eckerö Line. The reconstruction was completed by 1 May 2009.|$|E
25|$|Also on R deck, the {{first-class}} Turkish bath complex, the 1930s {{equivalent to}} a spa, was removed. The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was open for viewing by hotel guests and visitors. Because of modern safety codes and the compromised structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool {{could not be used}} for swimming after the conversion, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> water until the late 1980s. Today the pool can only be seen on guided tours and is in a derelict condition, having never been maintained by the hotel operators. No second-class, third-class or crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by Zibold's work, Chaptal built a small air well near Montpellier in 1929.

Small vent holes ringed {{the top and}} bottom of the pyramid. These holes could be closed or opened as required to control the flow of air.

500|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of Sheriff Walker and mill {{supervisor}} W. H. Pillsbury to disperse the mobs, white men [...] continued to gather. On the evening of January 4, a mob of armed white men went to Rosewood and surrounded the house of Sarah Carrier. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> approximately 15 to 25 people seeking refuge, including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses. Some {{of the children were}} in the house because they were visiting their grandmother for Christmas. They were protected by Sylvester Carrier and possibly two other men, but Carrier may have been the only one armed. He had a reputation of being proud and independent. In Rosewood, he was a formidable character, a crack shot, expert hunter, and music teacher, who was simply called [...] "Man". [...] Many whites considered him arrogant and disrespectful.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, in August 2003, Ranariddh and Rainsy joined hands once again, {{forming a}} {{political}} alliance {{known as the}} [...] "Alliance of Democrats". While the AD agreed {{to the idea of}} a coalition government between the CPP, FUNCINPEC and Rainsy's SRP, they also called for Hun Sen to step down as Prime Minister, and reforming the NEC, which the AD claimed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> CPP's appointees. Hun Sen balked at accepting AD's demands, leading to several months of political stalemate. During this time, several party activists from FUNCINPEC and SRP were killed, purportedly by henchmen linked to the CPP. At the same time, several FUNCINPEC officials have obtained loans from CPP-linked businessmen which they had used for financing their own election campaigns. These officials lobbied Ranariddh into accepting the idea of a CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition government so as to secure government positions and repay their loans.|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that...

500|$|Contemporary reviews were {{generally}} negative. Many reviewers condemned the play as immoral {{due to its}} sexual situations and suggestive dialogue. The costumes of its female cast members, who mostly wore revealing gowns or scanty bedroom attire, also attracted attention. A few reviewers complimented the cast for being attractive and fashionable. Others considered their clothing inappropriately risqué, especially in the [...] "Stripping Cupid" [...] scene. A reviewer for the Pittsburgh Post described the preview production as [...] "reeking with indecencies". The reviewer for the New York Evening Post gave the Broadway production only three sentences, claiming {{that there was no}} need for [...] "wasting space" [...] on the repulsive [...] "concoction" [...] created by Hopwood and Woods. Drama critic George Jean Nathan called the play [...] "trash". Dorothy Parker quipped that Dawn had [...] "gone from bed to worse" [...] by being in the production. The reviewer for Brooklyn Life said it shocked the audience from beginning to end with more frequency than a burlesque show. In The Evening World, Charles Darnton also compared the show to [...] "cheap burlesque", saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> [...] "old jokes" [...] but few laughs.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E
500|$|Bernardi {{suggested}} East St. Louis, Illinois, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{old buildings}} [...] "that exist in New York now, and [...] have that seedy run-down quality" [...] {{that the team}} was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, [...] "block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places there was absolutely nothing, {{so that you could}} see three and four blocks away." [...] As well, Alves found an old bridge to double for the [...] "69th St. Bridge". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, [...] "so that they wouldn't have any liability," [...] Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis, Missouri were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated, as well as the building which would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.|$|E

500|$|Part of the {{attraction}} for the writers {{is that they}} are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to make anyone the bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television commentators. Bex Schwartz of Rolling Stone opined that the installment {{was an excellent}} and well-written episode, proclaiming that it [...] "balanced zombie action with human drama". In his B grade review for the episode, Zack Halden of The A.V. Club felt that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] {{was one of the}} second season's more solid attempts; [...] "While there's no question this is still serialized, the story here had a clear beginning, middle, and end, and we stay focused the whole time on two plot arcs: Rick and Shane deciding what to do with Randall [...] while Lori, Maggie, and Andrea deal in their own individual ways with Beth’s desire to kill herself." [...] Halden resumed that it made him hopeful of future installments of The Walking Dead. Matt Barone of Complex, Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun, and IGN's Eric Goldman asserted that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was one of the series' best episodes, while The Star-Ledger Mark Mauer thought that it was redundant, ultimately concluding that [...] "it indulged in another subplot centered on a petty argument". Goldman professed that the episodic direction was more focused than previous installments. Concluding his review, he gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. SFX journalist Ian Berriman echoed analogous sentiments, inevitably issuing [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] a four-and-a-half star rating. He called it the season's best episode, and wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> [...] "action, explosive arguments, [...] difficult decisions".|$|E
