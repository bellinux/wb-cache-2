5|$|In 1462, Catherine's {{situation}} worsened. Her brother Vladislav revolted {{against their}} father and sought help from the Ottomans. The Grand Duke and the King started preparing defenses, but the latter made a fatal mistake by provoking the powerful enemy further and then relying on the help of Christendom. In the spring of 1463, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and his army started marching towards Bosnia. Catherine, who is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> her way south to visit her feuding family, immediately hastened back home.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries.

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without {{any interest in}} the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, {{in the opinion of}} Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
