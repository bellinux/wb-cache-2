50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> <b>fuze</b> {{designs are}} 'super-quick' but {{may have a}} delay option. 20th-century designs vary in the {{relative}} positions of their key elements. The extremes being the firing pin and detonator close to the nose with a long flash tube to the booster (typical in US designs), or a long firing pin to a detonator close to the booster and a short flash tube (typical in British designs).|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> <b>fuzes</b> {{can have}} a delay function, {{selected}} at the gun {{as an alternative to}} <b>direct</b> <b>action.</b> Delay may use a graze function or some other mechanism. Special 'concrete piercing' fuzes usually have only a delay function and a hardened and strengthened fuze nose.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> <b>fuzes</b> {{function}} by the fuze nose hitting something reasonably solid, {{such as the}} ground, {{a building}} or a vehicle, and pushing a firing pin into a detonator. The early British fuze at left is an example.|$|R

50|$|Violent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> is any <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> which {{utilizes}} physical injurious {{force against}} persons or, controversially (see below), property. Examples of violent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> include: rioting, lynching, terrorism, political assassination, freeing political prisoners, interfering with police actions, armed insurrection, and arguably property destruction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> is {{activity}} {{undertaken by}} individuals, groups, or governments to achieve anti-whaling goals outside of normal social/political channels: nonviolent and violent activities which target persons, groups, or property {{deemed to be}} engaged in whaling, commercial or otherwise. Examples of nonviolent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> include strikes, blockades, workplace occupations, sit-ins, and graffiti. Violent <b>direct</b> <b>actions</b> include sabotage, vandalism, and assault. <b>Direct</b> <b>actions</b> are sometimes a form of civil disobedience, but some (such as strikes) do not always violate criminal law.|$|R
50|$|The RGO {{hand grenade}} (Ruchnaya Granata Oboronitel'naya, ("Hand Grenade Defensive") is a {{defensive}} Soviet fragmentation hand grenade. It {{consists of a}} double layered steel pre-fragmented body. It {{is very similar to}} the single-layered offensive/defensive aluminium-bodied RGN hand grenade. It uses the UDZS dual <b>action</b> <b>fuze,</b> which has both impact and time delay functions. The impact fuze arms after a pyrotechnic delay of 1 to 1.8 seconds. If the impact fuze has not triggered the grenade after 3.2 to 4.2 seconds a second pyrotechnic delay triggers the grenade. The fragments produced by the grenade generate a lethal radius of between 6 m and 20 m, with the safety radius being 100 m.|$|R
50|$|One can {{divide the}} {{criticism}} against open rescue into two general categories: Criticism against open rescue {{as a method}} of <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> which often comes from other practitioners of <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> and criticism of the use of <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> which can come both from other animal rights activists and from outside the animal rights movements.|$|R

[...] Mellor defined <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> [...] "as the use of some form of economic power for securing of ends desired by those who possess that power." [...] Mellor considered <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> a tool of both owners and workers {{and for this reason}} he included within his definition lockouts and cartels, as well as strikes and sabotage.

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> {{has long}} been {{associated}} with European anarchism, from the industrial sabotage espoused by nineteenth and twentieth century anarcho-syndicalists to the anti-Poll tax activists and the "DiY culture" of more recent British movements. A particular ethic is identified within anarchist <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> which has two features: the first requires that means be in accordance with ends (prefiguration); the second {{the identities of the}} subjects involved in the act. prefiguration distinguished <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> from both Leninist consequentialism and the deontological approaches of liberal and anrcho-capitalist traditions. The identities of the agents involved and created through <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> illustrate important differences between anarchist <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> and that of more conservative groupings. The paper not only clarifies <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> but also considers whether a prefigurative ethic necessitates non-violence. Additionally, the paper answers the question of why <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> is embraced by the anti-hierarchical anarchist tradition, explaining the attractions of such methods to contemporary movements and illustrating parallels between contemporary anarchism and politically-engaged post-structuralisms. Examples are drawn from actions from the 1990 s to early 2000 s' the publicity and discussion materials of contemporary groupings and their critics as well as texts more centrally located within the academy...|$|R
40|$|Mirror neurons {{are single}} cells found in macaque premotor and parietal cortices that are active during action {{execution}} and observation. In non-human primates, mirror neurons {{have only been}} found in relation to object-directed movements or communicative gestures, as non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> of the upper limb are not well characterized in non-human primates. Mirror neurons provide important evidence for motor simulation theories of cognition, {{sometimes referred to as}} the direct matching hypothesis, which propose that observed actions are mapped onto associated motor schemata in a direct and automatic manner. This study, for the first time, directly compares mirror responses, defined as the overlap between action execution and observation, during object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> We present functional MRI data that demonstrate a clear dissociation between object directed and non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> within the human mirror system. A premotor and parietal network was preferentially active during object <b>directed</b> <b>actions,</b> whether observed or executed. Moreover, we report spatially correlated activity across multiple voxels for observation and execution of an object <b>directed</b> <b>action.</b> In contrast to predictions made by motor simulation theory, no similar activity was observed for non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data demonstrate that object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> are subserved by different neuronal networks and that the human mirror response is significantly greater for object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data have important implications for understanding the human mirror system and fo...|$|R

In {{most cases the}} <b>fuze</b> <b>action</b> causes detonation of the main high explosive charge in a shell or a small charge to eject a carrier shellâ€™s contents. These contents may be lethal, such as the now-obsolete shrapnel shell or modern sub-munitions, or non-lethal such as canisters containing a smoke compound or a parachute flare.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> [...] {{occurs when}} a group takes an action which is {{intended}} to reveal an existing problem, highlight an alternative, or demonstrate a possible solution to a social issue. This can include nonviolent and less often violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> participants. Examples of nonviolent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> (also known as nonviolence, nonviolent resistance, or civil resistance) can include sit-ins, strikes, workplace occupations, blockades, or hacktivism, while violent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> may include political violence or assaults. Tactics such as sabotage and property destruction may be considered violent if people are hurt in the action. By contrast, electoral politics, diplomacy, negotiation, and arbitration are not usually described as <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> as they are politically mediated. Non-violent actions are sometimes a form of civil disobedience, and may involve a degree of intentional law-breaking where persons place themselves in arrestable situations {{in order to make}} a political statement but other actions (such as strikes) may not violate criminal law.|$|R
