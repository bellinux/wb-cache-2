40|$|Topography {{affects the}} soil physicochemistry, soil N dynamics, and plant {{distribution}} and growth in forests. In Japan, many forests {{are found in}} mountainous areas and these traits are often highly variable along steep slopes. In this study, we investigated how the microbial population dynamics reflected the bioavailable N dynamics with the physicochemical gradient along the slope in soils of a natural forest in Japan. We measured the <b>gross</b> <b>rates</b> of NH 4 + production, nitrification, and NH 4 +/ NO 3 − immobilization using the N isotope dilution method to analyze the N dynamics in the soils. We also determined the abundance of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) using qPCR to assess the populations of total bacteria and nitrifiers. We found that <b>gross</b> <b>rates</b> of NH 4 + production and nitrification {{were higher in the}} lower part of the slope, they were positively correlated with the abundance of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and archaeal amoA, respectively; and the availability of N, particularly NO 3 −, for plants was higher in {{the lower part of the}} slope because of the higher microbial nitrification activity and low microbial NO 3 − immobilization activity. In addition, path analysis indicated that <b>gross</b> <b>rates</b> of NH 4 + production and nitrification were regulated mainly by the substrate (dissolved organic N and NH 4 +) concentrations and population sizes of total bacteria and nitrifiers, respectively, and their population sizes were strongly affected by the soil physicochemistry such as pH and water content. Our results suggested that the soil physicochemical gradient along the slope caused the spatial gradient of <b>gross</b> <b>rates</b> of NH 4 + production and nitrification by altering the communities of ammonifiers and nitrifiers in the forest slope, which also affected plant distribution and growth via the supply of bioavailable N to plants...|$|R

50|$|Students who are {{involved}} in higher education programs in western developed economies may have a <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> of return to a year's additional education ranging between 5 and 10 per cent. The World Bank, amongst other development specialists, has recognized that low levels of education are often key risk factors for poverty. A TD Economics paper reports that a university-educated worker's weekly earnings are on average 61 per cent higher than their counterparts with just a high school education. However, in combining the revenues for peer state private and public universities, Ontario invested 44 per cent less annually in its university system compared with the system in the peer states. Continuous under funding of education can be linked to Ontario's prosperity gap. Studies reflect that underfunding in education is one of the contributing factors of a $6,000 per person prosperity gap between Ontario and the jurisdictional average.|$|E

Assessment of net energy acquisition requires detailed information on instantaneous activity-specific power use, which varies according to animal performance, being influenced, for example, by speed and prey loading, and {{which has not been}} measured before in wild animals. We used a new proxy for instantaneous energy expenditure (overall dynamic body acceleration), to quantify foraging effort in a model species, the imperial shag Phalacrocorax atriceps, during diving. Power costs varied nonlinearly with depth exploited owing to depth-related buoyancy. Consequently, solutions for maximizing the <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> of gain and energetic efficiency differed for dives to any given depth. Dive effort in free-ranging imperial shags measured during the breeding season was consistent with a strategy to maximize the <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> of energy gain.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is {{that the effect of}} acceleration by a quaternary salt is greater on the development rate of the divalent ion than on the rate of development of the monovalent ion of hydroquinone. The <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> of development of a hydroquinone-sulfite developer was determined with and without a quaternary salt for a range of pH values. Comparison of the acceleration of catechol which is active as a monovalent ion with the acceleration of hydroquinone which is active mainly as a divalent ion was hoped to allow the separation of the hydroquinone <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> into the contributions by the monovalent ion and the divalent ion. The quaternary salt complexed with catechol to form an insoluble salt making comparison of the acceleration effect not possible. Chlorohydroquinone was chosen and the rate of development with and without the quaternary salt was determined for a range of pH values. Separation of the contributions proved not to be possible so the hypothesis could not be tested. Over the pH ranges (9. 25 - 10. 35 for hydroquinone and 8. 33 - 9. 16 for chlorohydroquinone) the <b>gross</b> <b>rate</b> of development showed linearity (on log-log scale) with the monovalent ion and the divalent ion concentrations but was determined to be dependent only upon the divalent ion concentration for both developing agents whether unaccelerated or accelerated developers. Diffusion effects were important with the accelerated developers because of the high rate of development. The quaternary salt caused a shift in the density-time curve for each developer solution to shorter times and also an increase in the slope past the induction period...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we provide}} an {{extension}} of the exogenous growth model developed in the previous chapter. The standard model assumes that human capital accumulation, which drives long run growth, is exogenously determined. Our extension involves endogenizing the rate of human capital formation by deriving it from the optimizing decisions of private households. The extended model emphasizes the role of saving (broadly defined to include investment in both physical and human capital) in the entire (short and long run) growth process. Cast in a stochastic framework, the engine of growth in this model (human capital) generates a unique feature, i. e., transitory shocks have long-lasting level and growth effects. In an integrated world economy, capital and labor mobility are potentially key elements in equalizing differences in levels and rates of growth of income across countries. Are labor mobility and capital mobility substitutes or complements for cross-country convergence? These issues are subject matters of the analysis in this chapter. 13. 1 The Closed Economy We extend the closed economy model of Chapter 12 in one particular dimension pertaining to the accumulation of human capital as described by (12. 3). More specifically, we can rewrite (12. 3) as H = N h = [(1 +g) N][(1 +g) h] = (1 +g) H.
