40|$|Mastitis is an {{important}} disease which causes economic losses in the water buffalo breeding. According to severity, duration and primary, mastitis is generally classified as clinical and subclinical. Because of contamination from other animals in the herd, subclinical mastitis is a important dairy herd problem. However, clinical mastitis is a clinical case created by deformation of udder gland and decreasing milk yield. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactia and Streptococcus <b>dysgalactia</b> are in clinical mastitis, but Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus agalactia and Streptococcus <b>dysgalactia</b> {{are the most common}} isolated microorganisms in subclinical mastitis. Due to mastitis caused by these microorganisms in Water Buffalo, abnormality in the structure of milk are observed, and it causes economic losses to farmers from reduced production. Therefore, the detection of effective factors on mastitis and taking of the necessary precautions are very important. In this review, mastitis case in water Buffalo and its effects were discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{performance}} of piglet weight gain is strongly {{dependent on the}} sow's ability to meet the demand for adequate milk. Postparturient disorders, especially those subsumed under the term postpartum <b>dysgalactia</b> syndrome (PPDS), can alter or reduce the milk production sensitively, resulting in starving piglets. The aim {{of this study was to}} gather further information about the prevalence of different bacterial species in the anterior and posterior mammary glands of sows with respect to the clinical appearance of PPDS. Methods In this study, the health status of 56 sows after farrowing was determined with special regard to mastitis and <b>dysgalactia.</b> Pooled milk samples from anterior and posterior glands were taken from both affected and non-affected animals and analysed bacteriologically for the presence of a wide spectrum of different pathogens. Results Mainly Escherichia coli, staphylococci and streptococci were detected in high percentages but without significant differences in healthy and diseased animals and anterior and posterior glands. However, the large percentages of coliform bacteria suggested a transmission route via faecal contamination. Conclusion In this study, the prevalence of different bacteria in anterior and posterior glands in PPDS positive and negative sows was analysed. No significant differences in bacteria of healthy and diseased sows were assessed. Therefore, the development of clinical PPDS and actual infection seems to be largely dependant on individual resistance in single sows. </p...|$|E

After passive transfer, mAb 5 B 7 could partially protect mice against S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> infection. Eleven positive phage clones recognized by mAb 5 B 7 were identified by screening phage-displayed random 12 -peptide library, most of which matched the consensus motif DTTQGRFD.

40|$|International audiencePostpartum <b>Dysgalactia</b> Syndrome (PDS) {{represents}} a considerable health problem of postpartum sows, primarily indicated by mastitis and lactation failure. The poorly understood etiology of this multifactorial disease necessitates {{the use of}} the porcine mammary epithelial cell (PMEC) model to identify how and to what extent molecular pathogen defense mechanisms prevent bacterial infections at the first cellular barrier of the gland. PMEC were isolated from three lactating sows and challenged with heat-inactivated potential mastitis-causing pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) for 3  h and 24  h, in vitro. We focused on differential gene expression patterns of PMEC after pathogen challenge in comparison with the untreated control by performing microarray analysis. Our results show that a core innate immune response of PMEC is partly shared by E. coli and S. aureus. But E. coli infection induces much faster and stronger inflammatory response than S. aureus infection. An immediate and strong up-regulation of genes encoding cytokines (IL 1 A and IL 8), chemokines (CCL 2, CXCL 1, CXCL 2, CXCL 3, and CXCL 6) and cell adhesion molecules (VCAM 1, ICAM 1, and ITGB 3) was explicitly obvious post-challenge with E. coli inducing a rapid recruitment and activation of cells of host defense mediated by IL 1 B and TNF signaling. In contrast, S. aureus infection rather induces the expression of genes encoding monooxygenases (CYP 1 A 1, CYP 3 A 4, and CYP 1 B 1) initiating processes of detoxification and pathogen elimination. The results indicate that the course of PDS depends on the host recognition of different structural and pathogenic profiles first, which critically determines the extent and effectiveness of cellular immune defense after infection...|$|E
40|$|Postpartum <b>dysgalactia</b> {{syndrome}} (PPDS) and locomotory {{disorders are}} common health problems in sows. Previous {{research suggests that}} they can cause substantial losses, reduce sow welfare, and result in premature removal of the sow from the herd. However, economic consequences of PPDS and locomotory disorders have not been investigated thoroughly. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine economic losses caused by PPDS and locomotory disorders and their impacts on sow longevity. A stochastic dynamic programming model, which maximizes return on sow space unit and assesses sow replacement under several scenarios, was developed. The state variables were litter size, parity number, and sow’s health status. The model describes changes in the production parameters such as the number of piglets born and piglet mortality. Herd data originating from commercial sow herds and from a research farm were used to parameterize the model. Sow longevity, health, and economic results are related to each other. Eliminating the risk of PPDS from the model increased the value of sow space unit by € 279 when compared to the baseline scenario. Eliminating the risk of locomotory disorders increased value by € 110. Results suggest that these estimates correspond to about € 29. 1 and € 11. 5 in economic costs per housed sow during her lifetime. The estimated magnitude of losses was € 300 –€ 470 per affected sow for PPDS and € 290 –€ 330 per affected sow for locomotory disorders. However, realistically speaking, not all of these costs are avoidable. Due to premature replacement associated with these two disorders, the average number of litters that the sow would deliver during her lifetime is decreased by about 0. 1 – 0. 4 litters depending on the scenario. We also observed that the optimal lifetime of a sow is not a fixed number, but it depends on her productivity level as well as health status. In general, a healthy sow could stay in the herd until she has produced 6 – 10 litters. Research is needed to understand the structures and interactions underlying health impairments, performance, replacement policies, and farm economics, and to provide pork producers with management recommendations...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the interactions between lactoferrin and a clinical bovine mastitis isolate, Strep. <b>dysgalactiae</b> ssp. <b>dysgalactiae</b> DPC 5345. Initially a deliberate in vivo bovine intramammary challenge was performed with Strep. <b>dysgalactiae</b> DPC 5345. Results demonstrated a significant difference in lactoferrin mRNA levels in milk cells between the control and infused quarters 7 h postinfusion. Milk lactoferrin levels in the Strep. <b>dysgalactiae</b> DPC 5345 infused quarters were significantly increased compared with control quarters at 48 h postinfusion. In vitro studies demonstrated that lactoferrin had a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of Strep. <b>dysgalactiae</b> DPC 5345 and significantly decreased the ability of the bacteria to internalize into HC- 11 mammary epithelial cells.

40|$|In the sow, acute {{coliform}} mastitis {{is the major}} cause of <b>dysgalactia</b> at parturition, a period when normal milk production is paramount {{for the survival of}} newborn piglets. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that phagocytose and kill bacteria is the first line of defence by the immune system against E. coli infection in the mammary gland. The overall aim of this thesis was to elucidate this aspect of the sow immune system around parturition in order to gain a better background understanding of the disease. The course of events regarding the number and function of leukocytes in the blood circulation and locally in the mammary gland was described in healthy sows around parturition. At parturition, PMN reached a peak in both blood and mammary secretion. The phagocytic capacity per PMN showed no change, nor did opsonic activity in serum, while the opsonic activity in mammary secretion increased after parturition. The sum effect of the variations on mammary gland defence mechanisms is not clear. The concentrations of oestradiol- 17 β and cortisol were determined, and variations were seen in blood and mammary secretion. Directed migration and phagocytosis of PMN in colostrum and milk were compared. Chemoattractant properties of the two types of secretion were similar, while the phagocytic capacity of PMN was lower in colostrum, which may make sows more susceptible to {{coliform mastitis}} during the early postparturient period. The concentrations of oestradiol- 17 β and cortisol were greater in colostrum. In a study of experimentally induced mastitis, prepartum opsonic activity in serum and functional capacity of PMN in the blood circulation were compared between sows that remained clinically healthy and sows that developed coliform mastitis after intramammary E. coli inoculation at parturition. The pre-inoculation chemotaxis, phagocytosis and expression of CD 18 adhesion molecules did not differ between the two groups of sows. In contrast, the pre-inoculation opsonisation of E. coli tended to be better in serum from non-affected sows. Thus specific opsonins likely contribute to local protection of the mammary gland. Possibly, prepartum opsonic activity in serum can be used to predict predisposition to develop clinical mastitis in the peripartal sow. To conclude, no clear-cut evidence for a markedly depressed function of PMN was found in the mammary gland at parturition. No impaired functional capacity of PMN in the circulation was found before parturition in sows that developed mastitis after inoculation. However, the same sows had less opsonic activity for E. coli in serum before inoculation than non-affected sows, which might contribute to a susceptibility to clinical coliform mastitis...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} in litter size, and consequently farrowing duration, in modern pig production during recent decades. At the same time, annual removal rates due to reproductive failure have increased and an association with litter size demonstrated. Underlying physiological mechanisms for the associations between these phenomena are not well established. It is plausible {{that the increase in}} farrowing duration is causally linked with the increase in litter size because it takes longer to farrow a larger litter. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged farrowing negatively affects subsequent reproductive performance of sows. Postpartum <b>dysgalactia</b> syndrome (PDS), the major puerperal disease complex of sows, can cause subfertility, {{but it is not clear}} that this is linked with prolonged farrowing. However, PDS and prolonged farrowing represent similar risk factors regarding increased backfat, constipation, low dietary fiber, and restricted movement in farrowing crates. In some studies there was evidence of a connection between prolonged farrowing and increased incidence of general clinical symptoms such as fever and anorexia. Therefore, it is feasible that prolonged farrowing increases the risk for PDS, which in turn increases the risk of subsequent subfertility. In order to understand better these tentative relationships it makes sense to look at the different symptoms dividually, it being most likely that prolonged parturition in particular affects the incidence of metritis. Puerperal metritis is an acute inflammation and infection of the uterus that occurs during the first week after parturition and is characterized by an enlarged uterus that results from fluid accumulation. In other species, including the cow, a long and difficult parturition increases the risk of puerperal metritis, which in turn delays uterine involution and subsequently reduces fertility by disturbing postpartum ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. Furthermore, long and difficult parturitions can cause retained placenta, which is of major consequence in the etiology of postpartum metritis. We hypothesized that prolonged farrowing decreases subsequent fertility, that is, pregnancy rate. Furthermore, we hypothesized that prolonged farrowing causes retention of placentae and metritis, delays uterine involution and perturbs follicular growth after weaning. We also hypothesized that sows that undergo prolonged farrowing release less oxytocin at subsequent estrus in response to boar stimulation. It is also known that prolonged parturition is linked with reduced oxytocin concentrations. We therefore speculated that this is the case also at subsequent breeding. At that time, oxytocin is needed for sperm transport to the site of fertilization and formation of the sperm reservoirs and thus, impairment of transport may have a negative effect on the establishment of pregnancy. Furthermore, corpus luteum function is important for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. The primary function of the corpus luteum is secretion of progesterone, the pregnancy hormone, and this function depends on other hormones active before embryonic attachment and maternal recognition. Whether corpus luteum function is compromised in sows with prolonged farrowing was not investigated in this study, but validation and testing of a transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy method for luteal tissue was done. This represents an easy and reliable tool for future investigations of corpus luteum function. In the first part of the study we determined the farrowing duration (time between expulsion of first and last piglet) of sows and explored whether there is a negative effect on subsequent post-weaning pregnancy rate (n = 148). In the following part, we explored the relationship between farrowing duration and placenta expulsion (n = 142), and postpartum uterine size and intrauterine fluid (n = 99). For that, placenta expulsion was observed until 24 h after birth of the last piglet and ultrasonography was used during the first week postpartum to examine the uteri of the sows. Uterine size and intrauterine fluid were used as indicators for initial uterine involution and puerperal metritis. Furthermore, we determined the farrowing duration of sows (n = 30) and monitored the subsequent follicular development using transrectal ultrasound twice a day between the third day after weaning and ovulation. At estrus, blood samples were collected in the presence of a boar in order to determine the endogenous oxytocin concentrations and release patterns. The results show that sows with a prolonged parturition (> 300 min) were 3. 4 (odds; P = 0. 027) more likely not to be pregnant. Farrowing duration was highly ssociated with retained placentae. Sows that experienced total (no expulsion of placental parts; 3 %) and partially retained placentae (no expulsion of placental parts after birth of the last piglet; 3 %) had longer farrowing durations (1009 ± 275 and 734 ± 136 min) than sows without retained placentae (369 ± 202 min; P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 004). Otherwise, farrowing duration conformed to a quadratic relationship with the number of expelled placental parts (P = 0. 001), placental expulsion duration (time between expulsion of first and last placental part; P = 0. 002) and time between expulsion of last piglet and last placental part (P = 0. 024). On the other hand, use of oxytocin increased number of expelled placental parts (LSmeans ± SD, 3. 8 ± 0. 2 vs. 2. 9 ± 0. 3, P = 0. 035), decreased the placental expulsion duration (172 ± 44 vs. 328 ± 26 min, P = 0. 011) and time between expulsion of last piglet and last placental part (148 ± 48 vs. 300 ± 24 min, P = 0. 025). Furthermore, prolonged farrowing (β ± SE, Wald χ 2, Odds; 2. 0 ± 0. 5, 13. 1, 7. 6; P = 0. 001), obstetrical intervention (1. 5 ± 0. 7, 4. 4, 4. 3; P = 0. 036) and two or more stillborn piglets (1. 4 ± 0. 7, 3. 8, 3. 9; P = 0. 052) increased the risk of having enlarged uterine size whereas oxytocin administration (- 1. 5 ± 0. 7, 4. 7, 0. 2, P = 0. 040) decreased the risk. Two or more stillborn piglets (2. 6 ± 0. 9, 8. 7, 13. 7; P = 0. 003), obstetrical intervention (1. 8 ± 0. 8, 5. 0, 6. 0; P = 0. 025), prolonged farrowing (1. 7 ± 0. 8, 4. 3, 5. 7; P = 0. 039) and impaired placenta expulsion (3. 3 ± 1. 7, 4. 0, 26. 9; P = 0. 044) were associated with intrauterine fluid. After weaning, OT concentrations were higher in sows with prolonged farrowing than in sows with shortened farrowing (LSmeans ± SD, 28. 0 ± 7. 7 vs. 20. 6 ± 7. 7, P < 0. 01). OT concentrations correlated with diameters of the follicles measured 5 d after weaning and when the follicles reached their maximum size after weaning (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 01 and r = 0. 57, P < 0. 01, respectively). The results show that sows with prolonged farrowing can show subsequent ubfertility, which may be linked with compromised uterine health. Sows with prolonged farrowing are at higher risk of impaired placental expulsion, puerperal metritis and impaired uterine involution. Using exogenous oxytocin after parturition may be useful in sows with prolonged farrowing in order to lower the risk for retained placentae and subsequent metritis. Obstetrical intervention should be careful and done under antiseptic conditions. Proper parturition management should be used in order to prevent piglets being stillborn. Against expectations, sows with prolonged farrowing duration had higher oxytocin concentrations and larger follicles at subsequent estrus. This merits further investigation. In addition, we adopted and tested a transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy method for luteal tissue, which can be used to study corpus luteum function. No effects were observed on the cyclicity and morphology of the reproductive organs of the sows: not on corpus luteum function, pregnancy rate, gestation length or subsequent litter size. A biopsy was obtained for 50 % of all attempts.

40|$|The {{effects of}} bovine S protein (vitronectin) on {{phagocytosis}} of Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> strains isolated from cattle with mastitis were investigated. Phagocytized streptococci {{were determined by}} a fluorometric microassay using glass adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Preincubation of S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> with bovine S protein significantly increased their phagocytosis by PMN. Bovine S protein {{had no effect on}} phagocytic killing of non-S protein binding S. pyogenes cultures. Enzymatic digestion of the bovine S protein binding sites on S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> with pronase resulted in a significative reduction of the effects of S protein on phagocytosis. It could thus be concluded that in addition to its role as a promoter of cellular adhesion and complement inhibitor, bovine S protein may also influence the phagocytosis of S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> during inflammatory processes. Foram investigados os efeitos da proteína S bovina (vitronectina) na fagocitose de amostras de Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> isoladas de bovinos com mastite. A determinação do número de estreptococos fagocitados foi realizada pelo método fluorométrico utilizando neutrófilos polimorfonucleares (NPM) aderidos em lâminas de vidro. A pré-incubação do S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> com a proteína S bovina aumentou significativamente a sua fagocitose por NPM. A proteína S bovina não causou efeito na fagocitose de culturas de S. pyogenes, já que não apresentam sítios de ligação para esta proteína. A digestão enzimática com pronase dos sítios de ligação S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> para a proteína S bovina resultou numa significativa redução do efeito da proteína S na fagocitose.

40|$|Beta-hemolytic group C and G streptococci cause a {{considerable}} invasive disease burden and sometimes cause disease outbreaks. Little {{is known about}} the critical epidemiologic parameter of genetic relatedness between isolates. We determined the emm types of 334 Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis isolates, and attempted emm typing of 5 Streptococcus canis isolates from a recent population-based surveillance for invasive isolates. Thirty-four emm types were observed, including one from S. canis. We formulated multilocus sequence typing (MLST) primers with six of the seven loci corresponding to the Streptococcus pyogenes MLST scheme. We performed MLST with 65 of the 334 surveillance isolates (61 S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis isolates, 4 S. canis isolates) to represent each emm type identified, including 2 to 3 isolates for each of the 25 redundantly represented emm types. Forty-one MLST sequence types (STs) were observed. Isolates within 16 redundantly represented S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis emm types shared identical or nearly identical STs, demonstrating concordance between the emm type and genetic relatedness. However, seven STs were each represented by two to four different emm types, and 7 of the 10 S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis eBURST groups represented up to six different emm types. Thus, S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis isolates were similar to S. pyogenes isolates, in that strains of the same emm type were often highly related, but they differed from S. pyogenes, in that S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis strains with identical or closely similar STs often exhibited multiple unrelated emm types. The phylogenetic relationships between S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis and S. pyogenes alleles revealed a history of interspecies recombination, with either species often serving as genetic donors. The four S. canis isolates shared highly homologous alleles but were unrelated clones without evidence of past recombination with S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis or S. pyogenes...|$|R
40|$|The mig gene of Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae,</b> a major bovine {{mastitis}} pathogen, encodes two plasma protein-binding receptors, α 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 -M) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this study, the mig gene from one S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> isolate was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The IgG receptor region encoded by mig was conserved in 16 S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> strains. An isogenic mig mutant was constructed by allele replacement mutagenesis of the wild-type gene in S. <b>dysgalactiae.</b> The IgG-binding activity {{was lost in}} the mig mutant strain, whereas the α 2 -M receptor activity was still expressed but was detected only in the culture supernatant. In flow cytometry phagocytosis and bacterial-colony-counting bactericidal assays, the wild-type strain was found to be significantly more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by bovine neutrophils (PMNs) than the mig mutant strain when bacteria were preincubated with bovine serum. We therefore speculate that the Mig protein of S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> plays a role in virulence of the bacteria by binding to the plasma protein α 2 -M or IgG and thus preventing phagocytosis by bovine PMNs...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective population-based study of 140 episodes of Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis bacteremia occurring in Finland during 1995 – 2004. Rare emm types {{were associated with}} more severe disease and increased mortality rates. Skin and soft tissue infections were more frequent clinical signs among cases caused by common emm types. Lancefield groups C and G β-hemolytic streptococci (GCS and GGS) may colonize the pharynx, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tracts (1). According to recent taxonomic studies, large colony-forming groups C and G streptococci that infect humans are classified as Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis (2). S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis and S. pyogenes share virulence factors (3, 4). The M protein is an important virulence factor because it confers resistance to phagocytosis (5). As with emm genes of S. pyogenes, the emm homologs of groups C and G S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis are used for sequence-based typing (4, 6, 7), with> 50 sequence types currently described (www. cdc. gov/ncidod / biotech/ strep/emmtypes. htm).

The pathogen has been recently isolated from different fish species in many countries. Twenty S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> isolates collected from Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia were molecularly characterized by biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis (BSFGE) using SmaI enzyme, and tuf gene sequencing analysis. DNA sequencing of ten S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> revealed no genetic variation in the tuf amplicons, except for three strains. The restriction patterns of chromosomal DNA measured by BSFGE were differentiated into six distinct types and one subtype among collected strains. To our knowledge, this report gives the first snapshot of S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> isolates collected from different countries that are localized geographically and differed on a multinational level.

The overall sensitivity of the latex test was 78 %, and specificity was 97. 6 %. Only 25 % of S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> isolates were detected, thereby accounting for the relatively low sensitivity. Ninety-three percent of the group C streptococci other than S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> were isolated from horses. When the latex test was evaluated for detection of group C streptococci other than S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> from horses, the sensitivity and specificity were 95. 3 and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Quinolone {{resistance}} is an emerging problem in Streptococcus pyogenes, and recombination with Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> DNA has been implicated as a frequent mechanism leading to resistance. We have characterized {{a collection of}} S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis isolates responsible for infections in humans (n = 314) and found {{a high proportion of}} levofloxacin-resistant isolates (12 %). Resistance was associated with multiple emm types and genetic lineages, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiling. Since we could not find evidence for a role of efflux pumps in resistance, we sequenced the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyrA and parC genes of representative resistant and susceptible isolates. We found much greater diversity among the parC genes (19 alleles) than among the gyrA genes (5 alleles). While single mutations in either GyrA or ParC were sufficient to raise the MIC so that the strains were classified as intermediately resistant, higher-level resistance was associated with mutations in both GyrA and ParC. Evidence for recombination with S. pyogenes DNA was found in some parC alleles, but this was not exclusively associated with resistance. Our data support the existence of a common reservoir of genes conferring quinolone resistance shared between S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. equisimilis and S. pyogenes, while no recombination with the animal pathogen S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> subsp. <b>dysgalactiae</b> could be found...|$|R
40|$|The taxonomic {{status and}} {{structure}} of Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae</b> have been the object of much confusion. Bacteria belonging to this species are usually referred to as Lancefield group C or group G streptococci in clinical settings {{in spite of the}} fact that these terms lack precision and prevent recognition of the exact clinical relevance of these bacteria. The purpose of this study was to develop an improved basis for delineation and identification of the individual species of the pyogenic group of streptococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory, with a special focus on S. <b>dysgalactiae.</b> We critically reexamined the genetic relationships of the species S. <b>dysgalactiae,</b> Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus canis, and Streptococcus equi, which may share Lancefield group antigens, by phylogenetic reconstruction based on multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and 16 S rRNA gene sequences and by emm typing combined with phenotypic characterization. Analysis of concatenated sequences of seven genes previously used for examination of viridans streptococci distinguished robust and coherent clusters. S. <b>dysgalactiae</b> consists of two separate clusters consistent with the two recognized subspecies <b>dysgalactiae</b> and equisimilis. Both taxa share alleles with S. pyogenes in several housekeeping genes, which invalidates identification based on single-locus sequencing. S. <b>dysgalactiae,</b> S. canis, and S. pyogenes constitute a closely related branch within the genus Streptococcus indicative of recent descent from a common ancestor, while S. equi is highly divergent from other species of the pyogenic group streptococci.

Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the human pathogen Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. Contemporarily, though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory identification method for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus <b>dysgalactiae,</b> Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus of human origin, and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of animal origin.
