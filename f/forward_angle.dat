5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight <b>forward</b> <b>angle</b> just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

40|$|Background: In π^+n and π^-p electroproduction, {{conventional}} models cannot satisfactory {{explain the}} data above the resonance region, {{in particular the}} transverse cross section. Although no high-energy L-T-separated cross-section data is available to date, a similar scenario can be inferred for K^+Λ electroproduction. Purpose: Develop a phenomenological model for the p(γ^*,K^+) Λ reaction at <b>forward</b> <b>angles</b> and high-energies. Propose a universal framework for interpreting charged-kaon and charged-pion electroproduction above the resonance region. Method: Guided by the recent model for charged-pion electroproduction, developed by the authors, a framework for K^+Λ electroproduction at high energies and <b>forward</b> <b>angles</b> is constructed. To this end, a Reggeized background model for K^+Λ photoproduction is first developed. This model {{is used as a}} starting base to set up an electroproduction framework. Results: The few available data of the unseparated p(γ^*,K^+) Λ cross section are well explained by the model. Predictions for the L-T-separation experiment planned with the 12 GeV upgrade at Jefferson Lab are given. The newly-proposed framework predicts an increased magnitude for the transverse structure function, similar to the situation in charged-pion electroproduction. Conclusions: Within a hadronic framework featuring Reggeized background amplitudes, s-channel resonance-parton effects can explain the observed magnitude of the unseparated p(γ^*,K^+) Λ cross section at high energies and <b>forward</b> <b>angles.</b> Thereby, no hardening of the kaon electromagnetic form factor is required.

50|$|Aaveqaspis inesoni {{is almost}} flat (dorso-ventrally). Its body is {{narrowly}} oval in general outline, disregarding the two large spines. The upper non-calcified (or dorsal) {{side of the}} body consists of a cephalon, 5 thorax segments, and a pygidium. The axis is slightly raised, but without a discernible furrow defining its outline. The axis is about 20% of the width of the cephalon. The cephalon is halfround, and almost twice as wide as long (along the axis). The (posterolateral) corners of the cephalon are acute, ending in short stout spines. The back margin of the cephalon from the spine to the midline has in the pleural region a <b>forward</b> <b>angle</b> and is first concave, then convex, then concave again, attaining a backward angle when reaching the axis, and finally convex, with a small node or median spine reaching the back margin. This pattern is repeated with all thorax segments. Antennae are not known. Dorsal eyes are absent. The thorax segments are each about 1.5 mm along the axis. The tail shield is dominated by a pair of large segmental marginal spines, reminiscent of large (or macropleural) spines in the thorax and of pygidial spines of certain trilobites. The one node it carries is larger and more sharply defined than the nodes on the segments. The frontal border of the tail shield is convex and curves laterally into the large spines which extend postero-laterally, constituting half the total body length. The back margin of the spines is concave and merges into a second pair of short, broad, triangular spines. Body parts on the belly (or ventral) side are not known, including any appendages.|$|E

50|$|Construction of {{what was}} first called the Chattahoochee River Line started on June 19 and would take about two weeks {{requiring}} a labor force of both convalescing soldiers from nearby hospitals and over one thousand impressed slaves. While some trenches existed near the state railroad bridge that could be expanded and lengthened, most of the line would be built from scratch. Shoup's design consisted {{of a series of}} arrowhead-shaped infantry forts—36 in total were built—spaced sixty to 175 yards apart and connected by trenches broken every thirty to 75 yards by artillery redans that would house two artillery pieces. Each fort consisted of an earthen foundation with log walls or parapets extending fourteen to twenty feet high depending on the terrain. Interior earthen walls would stop short of the log exterior walls forming a platform on which infantrymen could fire over top the fort. At the rear or base of the fort and behind the line would be an entrance or sally port. From above, the line would look like a saw blade with the trenches connecting the forts receding at a backward angle to each redan and then at a <b>forward</b> <b>angle</b> to the next fort creating what Shoup called a re-entrant. Along the front of the trenches would be walls or palisades made of stockades. Each fort could hold up to eighty men. Soldiers within the forts could load rifles and hand them up to riflemen on the earthen platforms who would provide interlocking fields of fire channeling an attacking force towards the re-entrant formed by the receding trenches where artillery fire from the redans would sweep the ground. If all the forts were manned at once, the River Line would prove to be a quite formidable opponent.|$|E
