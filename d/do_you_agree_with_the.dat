40|$|Objective: To {{agree on}} a {{proposal}} for pharmaceutical interventions and establish their classification taxonomy according to the CMO- Pharmaceutical Care Model (Capacity-Motivation- Opportunity). Method: A study conducted between March and May, 2016. Two phases of development were defined. A literature review was initially conducted. Then, the DELPHI-Rand-UCLA methodology was used {{in order to reach}} a consensus about those interventions selected, and to define the taxonomy. Fifteen (15) experts, specialists in Pharmaceutical Care for HIV+ patients, were selected. This selection was explicitly conducted, following a protocol in order to avoid any bias. An initial proposal was developed according to the interventions extracted from Phase 1. These were tentatively classified according to the CMO Model, in a category based on their design and utility. Three issues were raised from the initial question: <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposed classification? If not, there was an option to re-categorize. Additionally, they were asked about the importance, priority and impact to achieve pharmacotherapeutic objectives that they would assign to it. Interventions were classified according to the degree of agreement. Once a consensus was reached, the final taxonomy was established. Results: Eighteen (18) articles were finally considered. The initial proposal included 20 pharmaceutical interventions with the following classification: seven in Capacity, eight in Motivation, and five in Opportunity. Those interventions considered to have greater importance and priority were: Review and Validation, Safety, and Adherence. The interventions with the greatest impact were: Review and Validation, Coordination, Adherence, and Motivation. On the other hand, the lowest scores for importance were for: Planning and Social Coordination; and in terms of impact: Social Coordination. Conclusions: The taxonomy reached by consensus will allow to classify pharmaceutical interventions with the new model, and therefore to conduct an improved research and patient care. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to invite the Member Representatives Committee (MRC) to provide policy input on four issues of {{particular}} interest to the Board of Trustees (Board) as it prepares for the meetings on August 13 - 14, 2014, in Vancouver, BC. Enclosed with this request is additional background information to help MRC members solicit inputs from their respective sectors. The four issues are: Item 1 : Reliability Assurance Initiative (RAI) The goal of RAI is to fully implement a risk-based compliance monitoring and enforcement program. Partnering with industry, the ERO Enterprise executed a series of pilots to test and implement activities and approaches to support risk-based methods and evaluated the results of the pilots. Since the completion of the pilots, activities continue to document the processes and procedures as well as expand the use of select tools and techniques to additional Registered Entities. The ERO Enterprise is currently finalizing the documentation to complete a single design for the four modules outlined in the Compliance Oversight Framework (Framework) : risk elements, inherent risk assessment (IRA), internal controls evaluation, and compliance monitoring and enforcement tools. Following the Board meeting in May, the ERO Enterprise worked on developing the IRA Guide (see Attachment A). The IRA Guide describes the process used to assess inherent risk of Registered Entities by the Regions and serves as a guide for implementing and performing an IRA. The MRC is encouraged to provide feedback on the draft IRA Guide. Specifically, the Board requests input on the following questions: 1. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> process design of the draft IRA Guide to appropriately scope oversight? Are there areas for enhancement in the draft IRA Guide that would address specific concerns (please provide examples) ...|$|E
40|$|Questions {{that this}} paper raisesResponse to- Where is Medical Practice in India Heading? - Sunil Pandya [URL] 4;issue= 1;spage= 50;epage= 61;aulast=Pandya Q 1 : <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> author and share his pessimism? If you do not, give {{examples}} of success stories in recent Indian medical education and practice benefiting poor patients. Ans: I {{agree with the}} author totally. I was fortunate to have studied under many teachers under whom he too had studied in the medical college. As Dr. Pandya described in his article, many of our teachers were compassionate, sincere, highly professional and considerate individuals. I totally agree with Dr. Pandya's views. The unprofessional and unethical acts of the present day teachers and medical practitioners sadden us. I hear of the examples indicating the prevalence of greed, corruption, plagiarism and favoritism every time I visit India. It is sad that the noble profession of medicine is maligned by unscrupulous and uncouth individuals. Q 2 : The author does not consider the steps to {{be taken by the}} authorities. Can the Government, municipal corporations, associations of doctors, medical councils improve matters? If so, what steps do you suggest?Ans: The first choice must be, 'Physician, heal thyself. ' Dr. Pandya has aptly emphasized that the 'unprofessional acts of teachers are likely to be followed by students. ' (I would say they are being followed by many of their students). The healing process should begin with: 1. Mandatory courses in medical ethics for medical students and house staff in medical colleges 2. Nationwide mandatory conferences in medical ethics for the education of practicing physicians from all branches of Medicine, including teachers in medical colleges. One physician from Mumbai approached me during one of my visits and offered to pay the US Government officials to get a visa and a Residency position in a US hospital. He could not pass the Visa Qualifying Examination. I told him to get out. 3. The basis of education in schools and colleges should be to create good citizens out of students. On the contrary, the teachers are encouraging delinquency. Unless the schools and colleges introduce a curriculum to prevent bribery, plagiarism, unprofessional behavior and selfishness, the domino effect on various professions and businesses will not end. 4 Unfortunately, regulating bodies such as Government, municipal corporations and medical councils are the propagating institutions for such practices. They will gladly develop laws and regulatory policies for punitive actions against physicians, with the resultant consequence of handing power to the administrators who in turn resort to corrupt practices. The corrupt administrators can then extract bribes from such physicians. [No abstract available. ...|$|E
