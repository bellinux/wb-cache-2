5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater <b>Division</b> <b>Line,</b> also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
5|$|The NK 6th Division and NK 7th Division {{closed on}} Masan, attacking the US 25th Infantry Division on {{multiple}} fronts, {{with the main}} efforts aimed at the 24th and 35th Infantry regiments. At {{the same time that}} the North Korean 7th Division was trying to penetrate the 35th Infantry positions around Sibidang and Komam-ni, the 6th Division also sent strong patrols and probing attacks against the mountainous middle part of the 25th Infantry <b>Division</b> <b>line.</b> When the division issued orders to its subordinate units to take up defensive positions west of Masan, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry was still trying to seize Obong-san, the mountain ridge just west of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong, and across a gorge-like valley from them. At daybreak on August 15, the 2nd Battalion broke contact with the North Koreans and withdrew to Sobuk-san and the ridge west of Haman. The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry now came to the Haman area to help in the regimental defense of the sector.|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{partitioning}} a flow {{has been}} widely used by hydraulic researchers and engineers as a mathematical treatment to simplify complex flows. Although the flow partitioning argument is intensive, no specially designed experiments have been conducted to verify them or the models, or {{to determine whether the}} existence of <b>division</b> <b>lines</b> can be inferred from mean velocity profiles. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the existence of <b>division</b> <b>lines</b> in smooth channel flow by analyzing the mean velocity distribution in a flume with a smooth flat or curved bed. The newly discovered <b>division</b> <b>lines</b> from experiments were compared with the existing models. It is found that some proposed models proposed have good agreement with the derived <b>division</b> <b>lines</b> obtained from the mean velocity distributions...|$|R

5|$|Counter-attacks by the 4th Guards Division, {{reinforced}} by {{a battalion of}} the 220th Division, forced the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade back to the start line. On the right flank, one unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered {{a large number of}} shellfire casualties, while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire as it neared its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening and a salient was created in the 4th Canadian <b>Division</b> <b>line.</b> On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful. An additional attack planned for 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking a slagheap called Green Crassier and the mine complex at Fosse St. Louis. The attack was repulsed, with the majority of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.|$|E
