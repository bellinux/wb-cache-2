25|$|Climate {{change will}} stress water resources. Water {{is an issue}} in every region, but {{the nature of the}} {{potential}} impacts varies. Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation, and increased water loss from plants, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems of high-heeled shoe design involves a properly constructed toe-box. Improper construction here can cause the most damage to one's foot. Toe-boxes that are too narrow force the toes to be crammed too close together.

25|$|Conventionally, {{caesarean}} sections {{are classified}} as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation. Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important {{and is based on}} many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman. Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> affecting this decision.|$|E

[...] He also endorsed and voted for the Clean Air Act and said that global warming <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> to him.

We all {{should be able to}} play poker on the Web if we want to, and I believe that making it illegal strips us of our rights.

500|$|The {{approximation}} {{problem in}} network synthesis {{is to find}} functions which will produce realisable networks approximating to a prescribed function of frequency within limits arbitrarily set. The approximation problem <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> since the ideal function of frequency required will commonly be unachievable with rational networks. For instance, the ideal prescribed function is often taken to be the unachievable lossless transmission in the passband, infinite attenuation in the stopband and a vertical transition between the two. [...] However, the ideal function can be approximated with a rational function, becoming ever closer to the ideal the higher {{the order of the}} polynomial. [...] The first to address this problem was Stephen Butterworth (1930) using his Butterworth polynomials. Independently, Cauer (1931) used Chebyshev polynomials, initially applied to image filters, and not to the now well-known ladder realisation of this filter.|$|E
500|$|Benefits of {{treatment}} include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death. In {{the developing world}} treatment also improves physical and mental health. With treatment there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis. Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners {{and a decrease in}} mother-to-child transmission. The effectiveness {{of treatment}} depends to a large part on compliance. Reasons for non-adherence include poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse. The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may [...] reduce adherence. Even though cost <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> with some medications, 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010 and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.|$|E

500|$|When {{filling a}} new or {{unfamiliar}} mould {{for the first}} time, where shot size for that mould is unknown, a technician/tool setter may perform a trial run before a full production run. They start with a small shot weight and fills gradually until the mould is 95 to 99% full. Once this is achieved, {{a small amount of}} holding pressure will be applied and holding time increased until gate freeze off (solidification time) has occurred. Gate freeze off time can be determined by increasing the hold time, and then weighing the part. When the weight of the part does not change, it is then known that the gate has frozen and no more material is injected into the part. Gate solidification time is important, as this determines cycle time and the quality and consistency of the product, which itself <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> in the economics of the production process. [...] Holding pressure is increased until the parts are free of sinks and part weight has been achieved.|$|E
