25|$|Alfred Herbert Richardson (1874–1951) was an English policeman. He {{joined the}} Birmingham City Police in 1890. He {{achieved}} very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became Chief Constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully {{applied for the}} Chief Constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained {{until his retirement in}} 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the formalisation of procedures for police <b>identity</b> <b>parades,</b> making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his time. He came from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851–1938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871–1952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929. Thus three members of the Richardson family served as chief constables between 1902 and 1920. He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 April 1920 {{parts of}} Portobello, {{including}} the [...] "Jewish quarters", {{were subject to}} the largest raid ever carried out by British troops in Dublin. This {{was due to the}} shooting on the previous day of Detective Constable Harry Kells, of the DMP G Division, in Camden St. He was rushed to the Meath Hospital where he died. Harry Kells lived at 7 Pleasants St. and had been carrying out <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> among the many republican inmates in Mountjoy Prison. Two of those sought were Sinn Féin members Michael and William Kavanagh who lived at 5 Pleasants St., who had previously been [...] "fingered" [...] by Kells, and it was thought they would seek refuge among friends in the neighbourhood. Over 100 people were arrested that day.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, {{a man was}} arrested, {{detained}} from 2–4 May for {{in excess}} of 48 hours and wrongfully accused of murder. The man was autistic, and the police failure to handle such a case sparked controversy. According to the police, the suspect made a written confession of an assault that contradicted severely with statements obtained whilst interviewed with family members. A nursing home later offered the suspect an alibi, corroborated with video evidence, that the man {{could not have been}} at the alleged crime scene. Civil rights activists condemned the incident which traumatised a vulnerable individual, and criticised the police procedures including not proposing legal representation, lengthy detention, an methods for obtaining a bogus confession. The police chief expressed [...] "regret" [...] but refused to make an apology. Also in May 2015, police procedures for conducting <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> attracted controversy when suspects in an assault case on television reporters were allowed to wear shower caps and face masks during an identity parade, ostensibly to cover distinctive features, leading to the police abandoning the case due to insufficient evidence. The police stance was confirmed by the new Chief Commissioner.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{fairness}} and reliability, {{there are certain}} recognised procedures for <b>identity</b> <b>parades.</b> The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures. Nowadays <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially-fitted identity-parade rooms have one-way glass so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> are not possible or feasible, in which case photo parades take place. For the suitable conditions for photo parades, see S v Ndika.|$|E

5000|$|Video Identification Parade Electronic Recording (VIPER) is {{a digital}} system for {{conducting}} <b>identity</b> <b>parades.</b> Rather than recruit {{a group of}} volunteers who resemble a suspect, police officers can retrieve a selection of pre-recorded video recordings of people unrelated to the case under investigation. Police officers make up a virtual parade, using clips taken from this library, and witness is then shown these, along with recordings of the current suspect. [...] The system is used by many police forces across the UK.|$|E

50|$|The Devlin Committee was a UK {{committee}} {{based on}} the Devlin report of 1976, which looked {{at a number of}} criminal cases in order to draw conclusions on the method of visual identification of suspects. The committee was established to follow on from the investigations into the wrongful accusation of Adolf Beck by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1907. The Devlin report submitted to the committee was made after a number of cases where <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> led to the mis-identification of a suspect.

He strongly protested his innocence of involvement in that incident on Bloody Sunday. He claimed he was at Mass in Blackrock (over four miles from the scene of the shooting) at the time. Several witnesses supported this alibi evidence but it was false. However, witnesses including a church rector, attested that the claim by soldier witnesses to have known the time by the chiming of the church bell revealed that the bell had not chimed for years.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1970, Dolan and {{his band}} were {{performing}} at the Wookie Hollow Club in Liverpool. Dolan {{and a member of}} his road crew stayed in the venue for drinks and to chat to their fans. Some people at a nearby table were attempting to bully the (by now closed) bar into providing them with champagne. Dolan joked that they should come back in a few hours for a [...] "champagne breakfast". The men took exception to this and became abusive. Dolan and his companion tried to leave but were prevented from doing so. During the following fracas Dolan was headbutted, (breaking his nose) kicked, punched and slammed into lavatory fittings and a wall in a sustained attack which was only halted when the sound of police sirens could be heard. It took six weeks for the singer to recover well enough to return to work. The club was sued but went into liquidation. The police attempted to identify the perpetrators and held <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> which Dolan attended but no-one was ever prosecuted.|$|E
5000|$|The name of Duffy, a {{martial arts}} {{exponent}} and former railway carpenter, was identified by Det. Supt. John Hurst {{as a suspect}} among thousands of other names. He was a known sex offender, having been previously convicted of the rape of his wife, whom he {{is known to have}} informed of his belief the act of rape was a [...] "natural male instinct".1 A type of rare string called 'somyarn' was found in his parents' house. This linked him to the second murder victim. His experience of traditional bow saws linked him to the unusual method of strangulation using a self fashioned tourniquet and his knowledge of the South Eastern Rail system was part of his former job. David Mulcahy was also questioned due to his close friendship with Duffy, but victims were still traumatised and unable to pick him out of an identity parade (at that time <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> required the victim to physically touch the offender and get close to him). Mulcahy was released for lack of evidence.|$|E
