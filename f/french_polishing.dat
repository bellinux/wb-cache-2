2500|$|Top Gear is a British {{television}} series about motor vehicles, primarily cars. It is a relaunched {{version of the}} original 1977 show of the same name, airing since 2002, and {{has become the most}} widely watched factual television programme in the world. Since the relaunch, the conventional motoring magazine programme has developed a quirky, humorous and sometimes controversial style over time, and has become a significant show in British popular culture. During its first 22 series, the programme received acclaim for its visual style and presentation as well as criticism for its content and often politically incorrect commentary made by its former presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. Columnist A. A. Gill, close friend of Clarkson and fellow Sunday Times columnist, described the programme as [...] "a triumph of the craft of programme making, of the minute, obsessive, musical masonry of editing, the <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> of colourwashing and grading".|$|E
60|$|At this {{favourable}} {{moment of}} her voyage, I gave the alarm 'A man overboard!' (on the gravel), {{but he was}} immediately recovered, none the worse. Presently, I observed the Skipper overboard, but forbore to mention it, as he seemed in no wise disconcerted by the accident. Indeed, I soon came to regard the Skipper as an amphibious creature, for he was so perpetually plunging overboard {{to look up at}} the hands aloft, that he was oftener in the bosom of the ocean than on deck. His pride in his crew on those occasions was delightful, and the conventional unintelligibility of his orders in the ears of uncommercial landlubbers and loblolly boys, though they were always intelligible to the crew, was hardly less pleasant. But we couldn't expect to go on in this way for ever; dirty weather came on, and then worse weather, and when we least expected it we got into tremendous difficulties. Screw loose in the chart perhaps--something certainly wrong somewhere--but here we were with breakers ahead, my lads, driving head on, slap on a lee shore! The Skipper broached this terrific announcement in such great agitation, that the small fifer, not fifeing now, but standing looking on near the wheel with his fife under his arm, seemed for the moment quite unboyed, though he speedily recovered his presence of mind. In the trying circumstances that ensued, the Skipper and the crew proved worthy of one another. The Skipper got dreadfully hoarse, but otherwise was master of the situation. The man at the wheel did wonders; all hands (except the fifer) were turned up to wear ship; and I observed the fifer, when we were at our greatest extremity, to refer to some document in his waistcoat- pocket, which I conceived to be his will. I think she struck. I was not myself conscious of any collision, but I saw the Skipper so very often washed overboard and back again, that I could only impute it to the beating of the ship. I am not enough of a seaman to describe the manoeuvres by which we were saved, but they made the Skipper very hot (<b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> his mahogany face) and the crew very nimble, and succeeded to a marvel; for, within a few minutes of the first alarm, we had wore ship and got her off, and were all a-tauto--which I felt very grateful for: not that I knew what it was, but that I perceived that we had not been all a-tauto lately. Land now appeared on our weather-bow, and we shaped our course for it, having the wind abeam, and frequently changing the man at the helm, in order that every man might have his spell. We worked into harbour under prosperous circumstances, and furled our sails, and squared our yards, and made all ship-shape and handsome, and so our voyage ended. When I complimented the Skipper at parting on his exertions and those of his gallant crew, he informed me that the latter were provided for the worst, all hands being taught to swim and dive; and he added that the able seaman at the main-topmast truck especially, could dive as deep as he could go high.|$|E

50|$|<b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> became {{prominent}} in the 18th century. In the Victorian era, <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> was commonly used on mahogany and other expensive timbers. It was considered the best finish for fine furniture and string instruments such as pianos and guitars. The process was very labour-intensive, and many manufacturers abandoned the technique around 1930, preferring the cheaper and quicker techniques of spray finishing nitrocellulose lacquer and abrasive buffing. In Britain, instead of abrasive buffing, a fad of pullover is used {{in much the same}} way as traditional <b>French</b> <b>polishing.</b> This slightly melts the sprayed surface and has the effect of filling the grain and burnishing at the same time to leave a 'French polished' look.|$|E

5000|$|<b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> is a wood {{finishing}} {{technique that}} results in a very high gloss surface, with a deep colour and chatoyancy. <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> consists of applying many thin coats of shellac dissolved in denatured alcohol using a rubbing pad lubricated with one {{of a variety of}} oils (see below). The rubbing pad is made of absorbent cotton or wool cloth wadding inside of a piece of fabric (usually soft cotton cloth) and is commonly referred to as a fad, also called a rubber, tampon, or [...] (Spanish for [...] "rag doll").|$|E

50|$|The 'fad' {{is often}} {{lubricated}} with an oil that then becomes {{integrated into the}} overall finish. This helps to prevent the 'fad' from lifting previously applied layers of shellac. Typically, softer/ thinner oils such as mineral oil will produce a glossier though less durable finish whereas harder/ more viscous oils such as walnut oil and olive oil will produce a more durable finish. Although boiled linseed oil is commonly used as a wood treatment, it is too viscous to use for <b>French</b> <b>polishing.</b>|$|E

50|$|At {{the rear}} of the main {{building}} was the dormitory or ward block, containing two wards separated by a central ablutions area, and a doctor's room, sister's room, and store room at the far northern end. Floors throughout were of hardwood and the ceilings of Caneite. The ablutions area had terrazzo flooring and contained toilets, showers and locker rooms arranged around a central passageway running north-south, servicing both wards. French doors opened from the wards onto verandahs along both sides, which were screened with Aerolax blinds. A sub-floor extended {{the entire length of the}} building. It had concrete flooring and had been used principally as workshops. It was also part-enclosed as library headquarters for the Red Cross in Queensland (a large room at the southern end); store rooms; ablution blocks; laundry; boiler room; and <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> room. On the western side of the library was an extension which housed the handicraft section.|$|E
