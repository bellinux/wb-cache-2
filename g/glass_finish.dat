40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the impact of the use of a recycled crushed <b>glass</b> <b>finish</b> coat on flat roofs to reduce the transmission of heat from sun radiance to indoor spaces in the buildings. This research forms part of previous studies carried out by LiTa on the application of cool roof products to reduce the energy required for air-conditioning inside buildings. Many flat roofs are finished with crushed stone aggregates of natural or artificial origin. The use of recycled crushed glass as a cool roof is potentially a double opportunity to reduce the environmental footprint: it is a recycled material and it may reduce air-conditioning demand. In order to evaluate the real efficiency of recycled crushed glass, {{this research}} compared the results with other technical alternatives that are generally applied in real conditions.

30|$|The average {{concentration}} of cadmium (Cd) in the sediment of the River Ghaghara was recorded as 0.21  ±  0.08  mg/kg at Katerniaghat, 0.23  ±  0.11  mg/kg at Colonelganj, 0.28  ±  0.10  mg/kg at Ayodhya, 0.25  ±  0.10  mg/kg at Dohrighat, and 0.24  ±  0.06  mg/kg at Chhapra. The Cd {{value in the}} present study was found to be less than the permissible value set up by USEPA and TRV (Table  5). However, it exceeded the estimation of the ASV. This can cause toxicity to some aquatic species in the vicinity (Turekian and Wedepohl 1961, Hakanson, 1980). CF index follows the class 1 which shows low level of contamination. As indicated by the metal contamination factor (CF) the river stretch near the Ayodhya is more polluted in comparison to the other undertaken sites. Igeo value followed the class zero, it demonstrates that sediment is near the background value. In our previous study of the river Ganga sediment quality (Singh et al. 2013 a) using the same method, Cd concentration was 0.72  mg/kg at Ghazipur and 0.62  mg/kg at Buxar, which was slightly lower than the present study. Comparative estimates of Cd {{concentration of}} the stream Ghaghara with different rivers of the World have been listed in Table  5. Cd is a by-product of Zn and Pb mining and smelting, and more mobile in the aquatic environments than most of the other metals. It is also bio-accumulative and persistent in the environment. Cd is similar in toxicity to Pb and Cr whereas it is less toxic than Cu for the plants, while it is equally toxic to invertebrates and fishes (Moore and Ramamoorthy 1984). Cadmium is added to the surface waters through different sources such as paints, colors, <b>glass</b> <b>finish,</b> galvanized pipes, and so forth. Cd deposited on road surfaces from the studded tires. It is currently used for the production of nickel–cadmium batteries. Cadmium is more mobile in the waterway body than other metals. It is also bio-accumulative and persistent in the river body.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the magnetorheological (MR) {{effect of}} {{abrasive}} slurry, {{this paper presents}} an innovative superfine machining method. In this technique, the particle-dispersed MR fluid {{is used as a}} special instantaneous bond to cohere abrasive particles and magnetic particles so as to form a dynamical tiny-grinding wheel. This tiny-grinding wheel can be used to polish the surface of brittle materials in millimeter or sub-millimeter scale. The characteristics of the machined glass surfaces examined by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the Talysurf roughness tester confirmed the effectiveness of the finishing technique. The machined surface with convex center and concave fringe demonstrates that the material removal process is dominated by the synergy of the applied pressure and the relative velocity between the abrasives and workpiece. In the case of <b>glass</b> <b>finishing,</b> the mode of material removal is found to be plastic, and controlled by the abrasive-wear mechanism...|$|R
