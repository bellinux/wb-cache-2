5|$|Brett {{departed}} for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered {{a case of}} appendicitis, resulting {{in the loss of}} his <b>flight</b> <b>status.</b> After making a partial recovery, he served in France as senior materiel officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918. After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> on May 7, 1969.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{underwent}} {{treatment for}} his injuries that included months of grueling physical therapy. He attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during 1973–1974. McCain was rehabilitated by late 1974 and his <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> was reinstated. In 1976, he became {{commanding officer of}} a training squadron that was stationed in Florida. He improved the unit's flight readiness and safety records, and won the squadron its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation. During this period in Florida, McCain had extramarital affairs and his marriage began to falter, about which he later stated, “The blame was entirely mine”.|$|E

5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, {{even the}} {{turnover}} {{rate of the}} Swales years was surpassed, with five managers (three permanent appointments and two caretakers) taking charge of first team affairs {{during the course of}} the season. The third of these was Steve Coppell, the shortest serving manager in the club's history, who resigned on ill health grounds after 32 days as manager. The final of the five, Frank Clark, saw out the season but did not last much longer, losing his job in February 1998 with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football. Joe Royle was unable to prevent relegation, but subsequently achieved successive promotions to restore top <b>flight</b> <b>status,</b> though relegation a year later resulted in his sacking.|$|E
5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name {{from the fact that it}} carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his <b>flight</b> <b>status,</b> but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E
50|$|Despite some {{innovative}} features, the XA-7 did {{not proceed}} past <b>flight</b> test <b>status.</b> After testing, the sole prototype was scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|A {{notification}} service provides means {{to send a}} notice to many persons at once. For example, if a flood were likely, residents of a community could be warned it time to evacuate. If a school were suddenly closed for the day, students or parents could be told not come to school, or told to report to an alternate location. American Airlines can notify passengers by cellphone two hours before a flight's departure with information on the <b>flight's</b> <b>status</b> and gate number.|$|R

5|$|With the {{competition}} lost, {{the development of}} the XSBF-1 came to an end; the sole prototype was assigned to Naval Air Station Anacostia, where it had been tested, for use as a liaison aircraft and hack. In addition, the XSBF was used by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' Langley Research Laboratory as part of the facility's work on aeronautical research. During its time at Anacostia, the aircraft was involved in three accidents, one each in 1937, 1938 and 1939; after the first two accidents, it was repaired. The third accident—on May 25, 1939—resulted in the death of the pilot; the XSBF-1 was no longer considered worth returning to <b>flight</b> <b>status,</b> and the aircraft was officially stricken from the Navy inventory in July 1939.|$|E
25|$|The club then {{consolidated}} {{their top}} <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> with an eighth-place finish. The season also saw Tommy Johnson set a club record by scoring 38 goals.|$|E
25|$|By regulation, National Guard {{pilots were}} {{required}} to take and pass an annual physical {{in order to remain}} in <b>flight</b> <b>status,</b> in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6). Bush did not take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Col Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.|$|E

25|$|Williams flew 39 combat {{missions}} in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two Gold Stars {{in lieu of}} second and third awards, before being withdrawn from <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from <b>flight</b> <b>status.</b> During the Korean War, Williams also served in the same Marine Corps unit with John Glenn; the future astronaut described Williams {{as one of the}} best pilots he knew, while his wife Annie described him as the most profane man she ever met. In the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenn's wingman.|$|E
25|$|The RAF Museum in August 2012 took {{delivery}} of a static display reproduction of the Snipe.

25|$|Springer was {{responsible}} for Astronaut Office coordination of Design Requirements Reviews and Design Certification Reviews.

25|$|In May 1951, both Lockheed and Convair {{were awarded}} {{contracts}} {{in the attempt}} to design, construct, and test two experimental VTOL fighters.

Both experimental programs proceeded to <b>flight</b> <b>status</b> and completed test flights 1954–1955, when the contracts were cancelled. Similarly, the X-13 flew a series of test flights between 1955 and 1957, but also suffered the same fate.|$|E
