Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked {{the sense of}} grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno {{made a point of}} showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> universal {{and access to}} adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

Dracula has enjoyed enormous popularity since its publication and has spawned an extraordinary vampire subculture {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. More than 200 films have been made that feature Count Dracula, a number second only to Sherlock Holmes. At the center of this subculture is the legend of Transylvania, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> synonymous with vampires.|$|E

Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

During their married life, their dress sense <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> {{identical}} and both dress in practical outdoor wear. Their clothing is so similar that they have to write on initials in order to differentiate between their own items. Liz feels that she does not have the knowledge about fashion to dress smartly and loathes clothes shopping. Abdul contacted the show originally, fearing that their clothing has a negative impact on their self-confidence and social life, but Liz however feels {{that they do not have}} a problem. For dinner parties, Abdul is keen to dress smarter, but feels obliged to dress down to match a more casual Liz. Liz has a demanding job, often coping with a sixty-hour week. Soon into Woodall and Constantine's arrival, they discover that Abdul and Liz sleep in separate beds, so as not to disturb each other. When the couple are revealed behind the silhouette screen, Woodall and Constantine see an admirable figure on Liz that has been hidden by her unflattering clothing. In the makeover, Trinny dresses Liz in a fitted trouser suit and waistcoat to accentuate her figure. To give Abdul more youth, Susannah fitts him with a tailored suit and purple shirt.|$|E

500|$|The {{constitution}} {{remained in}} effect for {{little over a year}} before being overthrown by Russian armies allied with conservative Polish nobility in the Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Empress Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a de facto protectorate. [...] "The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> sovereign" [...] was the reaction of one of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The contacts of Polish reformers with the Revolutionary French National Assembly were seen by Poland's neighbors as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy and a threat to the absolute monarchies. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.|$|E
500|$|In foreign policy, spurned by Russia, Poland {{turned to}} another {{potential}} ally, the Triple Alliance, {{represented on the}} Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia, {{which led to the}} formation of the ultimately futile Polish–Prussian alliance. The pro-Prussian shift was not supported by Poniatowski, who nevertheless acceded to the decision of the majority of Sejm deputies. The passing of the Constitution of 3 May, although officially applauded by Frederick William II of Prussia, who sent a congratulatory note to Warsaw, caused further worry in Prussia. The contacts of Polish reformers with the revolutionary French National Assembly were seen by Poland's neighbors as evidence of a conspiracy and a threat to their absolute monarchies. Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition; a similar sentiment was later expressed by Prussian Foreign Minister Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert.

The Kingdom of Prussia was also strongly opposed to the new Polish constitution, and Polish diplomats received a note that the new constitution changed the Polish state so much that Prussia did not consider its obligations binding. Just like Russia, Prussia was concerned that the newly strengthened Polish state could become a threat and the Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, clearly and with rare candor told Poles that Prussia did not support the constitution and refused to help the Commonwealth in any form, even as a mediator, as it was not in Prussia's interest to see the Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.|$|E
