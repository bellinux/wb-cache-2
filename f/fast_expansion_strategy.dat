40|$|The brief {{presentation}} of the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions</b> is given to solve nonlinear differential equations. Application  rules of the operator of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions</b> are specified for solving differential equations. According to the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions,</b> an unknown function can be represented as {{the sum of the}} boundary function and Fourier series sines and cosines for one variable. The special construction of the boundary functions leads to reasonably fast convergence of the Fourier series, so that for engineering calculations, it is sufficient to consider only the first three members. The method is applicable both to linear and nonlinear integro-differential systems. By means of applying the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions</b> to nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations the problem is reduced to a closed system of ordinary differential equations, which solution doesn't represent special difficulties. We can reapply the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions</b> to the resulting system of differential equations and reduce the original problem to a system of algebraic equations. If the problem is n -dimensional, then after n -fold application of the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions</b> the problem will be reduced to a closed algebraic system. Finally, we obtain an analytic-form solution of complicated boundary value problem in partial derivatives. The flow of an incompressible viscous fluid of Navier–Stokes is considered in a curvilinear pipe. The problem is reduced to solving a closed system of ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions by the method of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions.</b> The article considers peculiarities of finding the coefficients of boundary functions and Fourier coefficients for the zero-order and first-order operators of <b>fast</b> <b>expansions.</b> Obtaining the analytic-form solution is of great interest, because it allows to analyze and to investigate the influence of various factors on the properties of the viscous fluid in specific cases...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the mediating effect of growth strategy (including market and product <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies)</b> on the linkage of market orientation (MO) to firm {{performance and the}} moderating effects of a firm's external connections (including political and business ties) {{on the relationship between}} MO and growth strategy. It finds that both market and product <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> are key conduits through which MO improves firm performance. In addition, the relationship between MO and market <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> is positively moderated by political ties but negatively moderated by business ties, while the linkage of MO to product <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> is moderated negatively by political ties but positively by business ties. By combining mediating and moderating effects in a framework that integrates MO, growth strategy, external connections, and firm performance, this study enriches our knowledge on the implications of MO and provides insight into factors that facilitate firm growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{determinants}} of global <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> of newcomer Multinational Corporations (MNCs) by focusing on Iceland, Israel and Ireland. We argue that newcomer MNCs from small open economies pursue complex global <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> (CGES). We distinguish four different types of global <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies,</b> namely, horizontal, vertical, lateral integration, and risk diversification. Building upon the traditions of Caves and Dunning and applying a multinomial logistic approach, we model CGES as a function of firm and country specific factors. The empirical evidence suggests that newcomer MNCs move away from simplistic dualities in the formulation of their strategic choices towards more complex options as a means of maintaining and enhancing their global competitiveness...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out in the}} service {{marketing}} literature that it is necessary for the growth of the service firms to expand their store network geographically. However, we still do not understand enough how firms should develop store network in the domestic market depending on their growth stage, because relatively little has so far been known regarding both how market expansion is categorized and how market <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> are related to the corporate performance. The purpose of this research is both to classify market <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> of service firms, especially what we would like to call “mini-box service retailers” which develop store networks with hundreds of outlets to cover geographic markets, and to clarify the relationship between their <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> and economic performances by analyzing 52 Japanese food service companies listed in Japan. Main results are (1) market <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> of mini-box service retailers were categorized into five types: Local Concentration, Proactive Expansion, Reactive Expansion, Concentrated National Expansion, Dispersed National Expansion, and (2) both Proactive Expansion and Dispersed National Expansion are found to be more profitable than Local Concentration. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{retrieval}} effectiveness of query <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> on a MEDLINE test collection using Cornell University's Smart retrieval system. Two <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> are tested {{on their ability}} to identify appropriate MeSH terms for user queries: expansion using an inter [...] field statistical thesaurus and expansion via pure retrieval feedback. These <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> do not require prior relevance decisions. The study compares retrieval effectiveness using the original unexpanded and the alternative expanded user queries on a collection of 75 queries and 2, 334 MEDLINE citations. Retrieval effectiveness is assessed using eleven point average precision scores (11 -AvgP). Expansion by retrieval feedback gives the best improvement of 16. 4 % over a baseline performance of 0. 5169 11 -AvgP. Query expansion using the inter [...] field thesaurus gives a significant but lower performance improvement (9. 9 %) over the same baseline.

40|$|High {{findability}} {{of documents}} {{within a certain}} cut-off rank is considered {{an important factor in}} recall-oriented application domains such as patent or legal document retrieval. Findability is hindered by two aspects, namely the inherent bias favoring some types of documents over others introduced by the retrieval model, and the failure to correctly capture and interpret the context of conventionally rather short queries. In this paper, we analyze the bias impact of different retrieval models and query <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies.</b> We furthermore propose a novel query <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> based on document clustering to identify dominant relevant documents. This helps to overcome limitations of conventional query <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies</b> that suffer strongly from the noise introduced by imperfect initial query results for pseudo-relevance feedback documents selection. Experiments with different collections of patent documents suggest that clustering based document selection for pseudorelevance feedback is an effective approach for increasing the findability of individual documents and decreasing the bias of a retrieval system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article aims {{to apply}} to the case of Avianca Airlines the Analytical Model for the Assessment of Airline <b>Expansion</b> <b>Strategies</b> {{developed}} by Moreira (2014) in order to explain the rationale of the <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> followed by this airline and indicate other possible <b>expansion</b> <b>strategies.</b>   Design/methodology/approach: This article is a case study {{in the sense that it}} aims to arrive to broad generalizations based on the collected evidences, focusing on one of the most traditional airlines in the world. This article is a positivist case study, based in the positivist understanding; because it is supported by objective facts of the situation which are informed by the researcher’s interpretive understanding according to it is recommended for this type of study. Findings: The application of the Analytical Model for the Assessment of Airline <b>Expansion</b> <b>Strategies</b> above referred was successful, considering that the model was able to explain a wide range of complex aspects of the Avianca’s development. Thus, being one of the oldest airlines in continued operation in the world, the expansion process of this airline is connected to many political, sociological and economic facets - ie., its general environment - of its mother country, Colombia. The analytical model offered the opportunity to explore these issues in a detailed manner, adding a broader comprehension of this airline that goes beyond its operating and economic analysis. Originality/value: They reside on the fact that this is the first time that this analytical model is applied to study extensively an actual situation. Besides, airlines in Latin America have not been widely covered by the academia and this is an opportunity to begin to fill this gap. Furthermore, the referred analytical model is applicable to organizations or firms that operate in other industries if the proper adjustments are made. Implications: The implications for the academic research are to understand that the reasons for the success or failure of an airline in an expansion process may be explained by the suitability between the <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> followed by this airline, its business model, its operating environment and its general environment. Moreover, this article demonstrates that the analysis of the suitability of the <b>expansion</b> <b>strategy</b> followed by a specific airline may be made in the light of a solidly founded analytical framework...|$|R
