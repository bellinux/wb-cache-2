40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> from {{an economic}} point of view. It focuses on the different forms of integrated care which were introduced by the German government to overcome structural shortcomings and inefficiencies in the German <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> resulting from the historically grown fragmented structure. <b>Integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> primarily aim at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of medical provision. Even though they offer a lot of possibilities and are of increasing importance over time, their diffusion underachieves. For a successful implementation and diffusion of <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> an appro-priate proof of their assumed success is required. This, however, is often missing and is methodologically difficult to prove. Although {{a variety of methods}} for health economic evaluations were established, they are mainly applied for the assessment of pharmaceuticals and often fail to evaluate <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems.</b> The underlying reasons for this are their specific characteristics which cause economic particularities in their diffusion process and their evaluation. Accordingly, the well-established evaluation instruments require a methodological extension to consider and represent these characteristics of <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, following a design-oriented research approach this thesis aims at identifying and developing potential approaches to extend health economic evaluation instruments while taking into account the diffusion characteristics of <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems.</b> This methodological extension is based on budget impact analyses which increasingly gain importance as an additional instrument for health economic evaluations. The evaluation approach developed in this thesis is based on a case study and allows an analysis of various actors’ perspectives of <b>integrated</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> and their financial interdependencies. So, inconsistent allocations of budget effects over time and their resulting impediments to diffusion can be identified. Consequently, appropriate countermeasures can be derived...|$|R

40|$|In the not-too-distant past, most {{physicians}} {{were paid}} {{by one of}} two ways: a fixed salary or by collecting fee-for-service charges.
