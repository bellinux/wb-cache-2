40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} can retain <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> {{within their}} micro-scale textures when submerged in water. This property reduces direct contact between water and solid surfaces and presents opportunities for improving hydrodynamic performance by decreasing viscous drag. In most realistic applications, however, the flow regime is turbulent and retaining the <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> is a challenge. In order {{to overcome this}} challenge, {{it is crucial to}} develop an understanding of physical mechanisms that can lead to the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces in retaining <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> when the overlying liquid flow is turbulent. We present a study of the onset of failure in gas retention by analyzing direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows over superhydrophobic surfaces coupled with the deformation of air-water interfaces that hold the <b>gas</b> <b>pockets.</b> The superhydrophobic surfaces are modeled as periodic textures with patterned slip and no-slip boundary conditions on the overlying water flow. The liquid-gas interface is modeled via a linearized Young-Laplace equation, which is solved coupled with the overlying turbulent flow. A wide range of texture sizes and interfacial Weber numbers are considered in this study. Our analysis identifies flow-induced upstream traveling capillary waves that are coherent in the spanwise direction as one mechanism for failure in retention of <b>gas</b> <b>pockets.</b> To confirm physical understanding of these waves, a semi-analytical inviscid linear analysis is developed; the wave speeds obtained from the space-time correlations in the DNS data were found to match with the predictions of the semi-analytical model. The magnitude of the pressure fluctuations due to these waves were found to increase with decreasing surface tension, and increase with much stronger dependence on the slip velocity, when all numbers are reported in wall units. Based on a fitted scaling a threshold criterion for the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces is developed that is based on estimates of the onset condition required for the motion of contact lines. The second contribution of this work is the development of boundary maps that identify stable and unstable zones in a parameter space consisting of working parameter and design parameters including texture size and material contact angle. We provide a brief description of previously identified failure modes of superhydrophobic surfaces, namely the stagnation pressure and shear driven drainage mechanisms. In an overlay map the stable and unstable zones due to each mechanism are presented. For various input conditions, we provide scaling laws that identify the most critical mechanism limiting the stability of gas retention by superhydrophobic surfaces...|$|R

Seismic data reveal <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> that appear partially trapped beneath the shallow base of gas hydrate stability.

We predict intense regions of hydro-fracturing to preferentially develop beneath the ridge top rather than beneath the flanks, due to more pronounced overpressure generation and gas migration through hydrate-bearing sediments. Results suggest that sediment weakening and {{erosion of the}} ridge top by hydro-fracturing could be owed to fluid dynamics of the shallow gas hydrate system...|$|R

40|$|LectureBarrios (2007) {{conducted}} an experimental work in which was {{demonstrated that the}} two-phase stage performance of an electrical submersible pump (ESP) {{is related to the}} impeller gas and liquid flow pattern as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) for a volute-type centrifugal pump. Barrios (2007) proved that the stage head breakdown is a consequence of the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation in the impeller channel as in a volute type pump. However, the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is described as unstable by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) so a slug-flow-like pattern is observed in the impeller channel at the head breakdown conditions. Barrios (2007) observed that the gas segregates near the back shroud after the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation so that it is stable and a gas segregated pattern is observed into the impeller. The discrepancy between both studies may imply that different mechanisms are acting in the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation and its stability, which finally affects the stage performance. The objective of this research is to study the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> behavior through the visualization of the flow pattern within an ESP impeller at different operating conditions and fluid properties. Therefore, a series of experimental tests has been conducted utilizing a two-stage prototype at rotational speeds between 600 rpm and 1000 rpm, 2 psig inlet pressure and volumetric gas fraction up to 10 percent. This prototype was built with a transparent acrylic casing to easily observe the flow pattern within the impeller, at the diffuser region and at the impeller inlet region. The gas and liquid flow patterns are observed from videos taken with high speed cameras. Two ports for gas injection have been disposed so the gas can be injected directly to the impeller inlet to get the single stage performance or through the first stage to obtain the multistage performance. A combination of different fluids such as distilled water and air, distilled water and sulfur hexafluoride, and air and a mixture of isopropanol (IPA) and water was utilized in this study. The videos show that the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is small and located near the front shroud at liquid flow rates higher than stage best efficiency point (BEP). It is formed and dragged out by liquid flowing over the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a). The <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> becomes stable once it has grown through the channel cross section area when the liquid flow rate is reduced down to BEP. At this operating condition, the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> reduces the upper flowing area and forces the liquid to flow in the remaining area between the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> and the trailing channel face. Further reduction of liquid flow rate below the BEP causes the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> to segregate forcing the liquid to flow underneath as Barrios (2007) mentioned. The <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is formed even at zero head, which demonstrates that it is a consequence of bubble coalescence within impeller channel. The critical gas fraction for the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation varies as a function of gas density while its stability and formation {{is a function of the}} surface tension and bubble size...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{nucleation}} of bubbles on solids that are gently rubbed {{against each other in}} a liquid. The phenomenon is found to depend strongly on the material and roughness of the solid surfaces. For a given surface, temperature, and gas content, a trail of growing bubbles is observed if the rubbing force and velocity exceed a certain threshold. Direct observation through a transparent solid shows that each bubble in the trail results from the early coalescence of several microscopic bubbles, themselves detaching from microscopic <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> forming between the solids. From a detailed study of the wear tracks, with atomic force and scanning electron microscopy imaging, we conclude that these microscopic <b>gas</b> <b>pockets</b> originate from a local fracturing of the surface asperities, possibly enhanced by chemical reactions at the freshly created surfaces. Our findings will be useful either for preventing undesired bubble formation or, on the contrary, for "writing with bubbles," i. e., creating controlled patterns of microscopic bubbles.
