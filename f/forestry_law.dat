40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the present situation of forestry, we need to know about experiences of the past well enough. Through two different <b>forestry</b> <b>laws</b> that came into effect in our country in 1937 and in 1956, important reforms were attempted in forest policies and applications. It is possible to say that, these applications have laid the foundations of the Republic era forestry policies, and their significant reflections have reached the present day. There are various studies that explain the forestry practices {{in the first years of}} the Republic. These studies mainly approach the subject matter with a general perspective. How the forestry policies and applications have been perceived and evaluated outside the major cities, have not been studied adequately. This article attempts to study how the forestry policies in the first years of the republic have affected the daily life outside the major cities. In doing so, a local newspaper “Bartın”, which has a long and uninterrupted publishing history, was selected. In this study, the period between 1933 and 1961 was examined under four headings: <b>forestry</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>forestry</b> organization, forest protection, and problem of fuel wood. The findings were compared with the current literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Forestry is {{the main}} body of {{ecological}} construction, as well as one basic industry and commonweal career for the sustainable development of economic society. The importance of forest resources and forestry requires us to deepen the conception of sustainable development into various aspects of forestry construction. This article is divided into three sections. In the first section, the definitions of Forestry, Sustainable Development and Sustainable Forestry are respectively described. In the second section, the current situation of China’s forestry and the problems related to its sustainable development are presented. The author makes an analysis from following four aspects: 1. Recoverable resources in the forestry are shrinking and forest resources have been seriously destroyed, deadly threatening the ecological balance; 2 : The current forest management is extensive, and the research on forestry technologies lags behind; 3 : People are lack of awareness in the sustainable development of forestry, so there is no sufficient public participation in this issue; and, 4 : The forestry management is complex and relevant regulations need to be further improved. In the third section, legal measures to achieve the sustainable development of forestry are proposed. The author suggests preparing and improving China’s <b>forestry</b> <b>laws</b> with international conventions and agreements as the reference; strengthening the research on basic theories to build a scientific and rational overall theoretical framework; and taking the sustainable development of forestry as the guide to improve various <b>forestry</b> <b>laws</b> and regulations so that the current situation of China’s forestry is greatly improved...|$|R

50|$|Financing of PSA {{activities}} {{was initially}} accomplished {{in part through}} a fuel tax established by <b>Forestry</b> <b>Law</b> 7575. The tax was used to flexibly target ecologically important areas. In 2006 a water tariff was introduced to provide additional funding. The water tariff has a relatively narrow application {{when compared to the}} fuel tax. Under the water tariff, holders of water concessions pay fees, a portion of which is transferred for use in the PSA exclusively within the watershed in which the revenues were generated. This removes the potential for revenues to be distributed as needed and has been criticized for concentrating funding in select areas, despite their relatively low ecological importance.|$|E

40|$|Although {{policies}} to improve forest management {{have been widely}} introduced, poor logging practices remain prevalent in tropical forests. We assess whether recent radical changes in <b>forestry</b> <b>laws</b> in Peru will result in significant improvements in logging practices. We adapt North's conceptual framework of institutional change to analyze the impact of governance on loggers' norms and argue that improvements in logging practices will require changes in both laws and norms. The analysis uses survey and field evaluation data on logging practices in Peru, as well as secondary sources. Results show that bringing about radical changes in logging practices is particularly difficult in countries {{with a history of}} governance failures in the timber sector. In Peru, governance failures that have promoted norms inconsistent with good management are government's perceived lack of interest in long-term timber management, inconsistent <b>forestry</b> <b>laws,</b> perceived discrimination against the timber sector, and ineffective law enforcement. As a result of decades of these governance failures, loggers developed a short-term perspective on timber extraction and felt entitled to violate government's laws. Poor logging practices continued under the new law because of governance failures. The Peruvian experience shows that changing laws radically is often easier than avoiding governance failures in implementation. While some governance failures were partially rectified, others assumed added significance under the provisions of the new law. Decentralization also exacerbated existing and new governance problems. These failures reinforced existing norms and may, in addition, lead to norms condoning corruption. Modifications need to occur both in norms and in logging laws to reduce the inconsistency between the two. Notable improvements in governance will be required to bring about changes in norms. Changes in the logging system are therefore likely to be far less revolutionary, and to take far longer, than envisioned...|$|R
