5000|$|In {{high-density}} oligonucleotide SNP arrays, {{hundreds of}} thousands of probes are arrayed on a small chip, allowing for many SNPs to be interrogated simultaneously. [...] Because SNP alleles only differ in one nucleotide and because it is difficult to achieve optimal hybridization conditions for all probes on the array, the target DNA has the potential to hybridize to mismatched probes. This is addressed somewhat by using several redundant probes to interrogate each SNP. Probes are designed to have the SNP site in several different locations as well as containing mismatches to the SNP allele. By comparing the <b>differential</b> <b>amount</b> of hybridization of the target DNA to each of these redundant probes, it is possible to determine specific homozygous and heterozygous alleles. Although oligonucleotide microarrays have a comparatively lower specificity and sensitivity, the scale of SNPs that can be interrogated is a major benefit.

40|$|Summary The {{amount of}} light {{reflected}} from a retroreflective traffic sign decreases {{with an increase in}} the observation angle&mdash;the angle between the headlamp, the sign, and the eyes of the driver. Mainly because of the increased seated eye height of truck drivers, the actual observation angles are greater for them than they are for car drivers. Consequently, there is concern about the impaired night-time detection and legibility of retroreflective signs for truck drivers. The present study evaluated the relative {{amount of light}} reaching drivers of different types of vehicle by using survey data collected in 1989 by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) in England. The TRRL data included driver eye heights and headlamp mounting heights for 445 vehicles. The present analysis considered three sign locations on a straight roadway: left shoulder, centre, and right shoulder. Two viewing distances were included: 152 m (500 feet) (typical of a sign-legibility distance), and 305 m (1000 feet) (typical of a sign-detection distance). The analysis considered both the <b>differential</b> <b>amount</b> of illumination impinging on the signs from headlamps of trucks and cars, as well as the <b>differential</b> <b>amount</b> of the light reflected from the signs in the direction of truck drivers and car drivers. The main results are that for the viewing distance of 152 m, the amount of light reaching a truck driver can be as low as 25 % of the light reaching a car driver; the corresponding percentages for the viewing distance of 305 m are as low as 68 %. These reductions were then related to the expected effects on sign legibility and detection. The results imply that the increased eye height of truck drivers could have a major effect on the legibility of retroreflective traffic signs, but only a modest effect on their detection. ...|$|E

The characterization of copy number variants of satellite VI in the related deer species agrees with the satellite DNA library model as the consequence of concerted evolution (Fry and Salser [1977]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]). The variable FISH signals of satellite VI were observed between some homologous chromosomes in Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar deer, and Formosan sika deer. Such different FISH signal strengths/intensities of satellite VI between the homologous chromosomes were most likely due to unequal crossing-over events. It has been suggested that a short monomer size, such as the 11 -bp monomer size of satellite VI in this study, offers ample opportunities for unequal crossing-over during meiosis and results in copy number variation between homologous chromosomes (Smith [1976]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]).|$|E

In Polistes wasps, the current paradigm holds that <b>differential</b> <b>amounts</b> of nutrition during the larval stage cause the divergence of worker and gyne (potential queen) castes [2]. But nutrition level alone cannot {{explain how the}} first few females to be produced in a colony develop rapidly yet have small body sizes and worker phenotypes [3,  4]. Here, we provide evidence that a mechanical signal biases caste toward a worker phenotype. In Polistes fuscatus, the signal {{takes the form of}} antennal drumming (AD), wherein a female trills her antennae synchronously on the rims of nest cells while feeding prey-liquid to larvae [5]. The frequency of AD occurrence is high early in the colony cycle, when larvae destined to become workers are being reared, and low late in the cycle, when gynes are being reared [6]. Subjecting gyne-destined brood to simulated AD-frequency vibrations caused them to emerge as adults with reduced fat stores, a worker trait [7]. This suggests that AD influences the larval developmental trajectory by inhibiting a physiological element that is necessary to trigger diapause, a gyne trait [8]...|$|R

Within the first set of images, on average 1 s from when the participant begins to read a sentence, there was significant activation in a key cortical area involved in language comprehension (the left posterior temporal gyrus) and visuospatial processing (the left and right parietal regions). In all three areas, the amount of activation during sentence comprehension was higher for negative sentences than for their affirmative counterparts, which are linguistically less complex. The effect of negation indicates that the activation in these areas is modulated by the difficulty of the linguistic processing.

40|$|Background: Under {{experimental}} conditions, {{virtually all}} behaviors of Caenorhabditis elegans are achieved by com-binations of simple locomotion, including forward, reversal movement, turning by deep body bending, and gradual shallow turning. To study how worms regulate these locomotion {{in response to}} sensory information, acidic pH avoid-ance behavior was analyzed by using worm tracking system. Results: In the acidic pH avoidance, we characterized two types of behavioral maneuvers that have similar behavioral sequences in chemotaxis and thermotaxis. A stereotypic reversal-turn-forward sequence of reversal avoidance caused an abrupt random reorientation, and a shallow gradual turn in curve avoidance caused non-random reorientation in a less acidic direction to avoid the acidic pH. Our results suggest that these two maneuvers were each triggered by a distinct threshold pH. A simulation study using the two-distinct-threshold model reproduced the avoidance behavior of the real worm, supporting {{the presence of the}} threshold. Threshold pH for both reversal and curve avoidance was altered in mutants with reduced or enhanced glutamatergic signaling from acid-sensing neurons. Conclusions: C. elegans employ two behavioral maneuvers, reversal (klinokinesis) and curve (klinotaxis) to avoid acidic pH. Unlike the chemotaxis in C. elegans, reversal and curve avoidances were triggered by absolute pH rather than temporal derivative of stimulus concentration in this behavior. The pH threshold is different between reversal and curve avoidance. Mutant studies suggested that the difference results from a <b>differential</b> <b>amount</b> of glutamate released from ASH and ASK chemosensory neurons...|$|E
