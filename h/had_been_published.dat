Opinions are divided how great a risk this was: the poem <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>published</b> in Soviet media, and was not banned, but it remained controversial. After the symphony's premiere, Yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem which said that Russians and Ukrainians had died alongside the Jews at Babi Yar.|$|E
