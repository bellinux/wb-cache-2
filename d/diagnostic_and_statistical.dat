5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year.

40|$|When {{providing}} probabilistic forecasts for {{uncertain future}} events, {{it is common}} to strive for calibrated forecasts, that is, the predictive distribution should be compatible with the observed outcomes. Several notions of calibration are available {{in the case of a}} single forecaster alongside with <b>diagnostic</b> tools <b>and</b> <b>statistical</b> tests to assess calibration in practice. Often, there is more than one forecaster providing predictions, and these forecasters may use information of the others and therefore influence one another. We extend common notions of calibration, where each forecaster is analysed individually, to notions of cross-calibration where each forecaster is analysed with respect to the other forecasters in a natural way. It is shown theoretically and in simulation studies that cross-calibration is a stronger requirement on a forecaster than calibration. Analogously to calibration for individual forecasters, we provide <b>diagnostic</b> tools <b>and</b> <b>statistical</b> tests to assess forecasters in terms of cross-calibration. The methods are illustrated in simulation examples and applied to probabilistic forecasts for inflation rates by the Bank of England...|$|R

40|$|PTSD is {{a recent}} {{disorder}} in the scope of psychology, only formally introduced to the <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders in the 1970 s. Since then, recognition of the disorder and its sources has increased both in psychological awareness and public consciousness. PTSD can come from any severe traumatic event, and can take several forms, as well as imitate other disorders. Although many perceive it as an incurable mental illness, there are numerous evidence-based treatments available. In addition to proven cognitive, psychodynamic, and humanistic therapies, experimental methods are testing new exposure techniques and new ways of reducing patient arousal.

These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

It is an ideal software tool for the exploratory phase of model building as any modifications of a model including changes of priors and sampling error distributions are readily realized with only minor changes of the code. However, due to the single move Gibbs sampler, convergence can be slow.

Communities such as STP (International Campaign Stop Trans Pathologization) argues that it has observed, “structural interrelations between dynamics of psychiatrization, discrimination, and transphobia and on acknowledgement of the negative effects that a psychiatric classification has on the citizenship of people”. Sonny Nordmarken states that, “The idea that trans people are mentally ill is institutionalized in psychiatric texts such as the <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders and thus also in medical and legal transition routes” Sonny believes that when transgender people are placed in a psychology text, they are stigmatized as mentally ill, and thus increasing microaggressions and discrimination.  A study by Schilt and Wiswall showed that in a workplace environment transitioning trans men were supported in incorporating them more into society; whereas transitions trans women were demoted or fired. In the study microaggressions were noted by employers to transitioning trans women.|$|R

In the fifth edition of the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder.

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

Methods. The retrospective clinical study of drawings of war veterans was performed. A total of 89 war veterans met the <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) PTSD criteria and were consecutively admitted to the Day Hospital during 5 years. Art group therapy as part of integrative treatment was performed once a week. The group was open and heterogeneous. Qualitative analysis of drawings content and group protocols were obtained. The drawings were made by free associations. War related themes were explored and descriptive statistics were applied. Results. The most frequent type of common themes of combat stress presented battle and witnessing wounded and killed combatants. Less frequent were themes of graves, destroyed cities and broken trees. The veterans preferred black and red colors with association to death, blood, wounds and destroyed objects. Conclusion. Drawing could provide a unique, complex, visual illustration of war traumatic experiences and memories of posttraumatic stress disorder veterans. Art group discussion might enhance war veterans’ verbal expression due to group support in safe setting.
