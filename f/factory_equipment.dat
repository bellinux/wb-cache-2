25|$|In 1945, Kamolikov was {{discharged}} {{because of his}} wounds. He moved to Novosibirsk and graduated from a civil engineering school there. He worked as a foreman and engineer at the Tyazhstankogidropress <b>Factory</b> <b>Equipment</b> Supply plant. In 1967, he moved to Bila Tserkva and worked at an electric condenser factory. Kamolikov died on 16 April 1977.|$|E
25|$|In July 1939 the Triumph Motor Company {{went into}} {{receivership}} and the <b>factory,</b> <b>equipment</b> and goodwill were offered for sale. The Thos W Ward scrapping company purchased Triumph, and placed Healey in charge as general manager, but {{the effects of}} the Second World War again stopped the production of cars; the Holbrook Lane works were completely destroyed by bombing in 1940.|$|E
25|$|Dmitry Timofeyevich Kamolikov (Russian: Дмитрий Тимофеевич Камоликов; 1923 – 16 April 1977) was a Red Army {{sergeant}} and a Hero of the Soviet Union. Kamolikov {{was awarded}} the title for his actions in the Budapest Offensive during the crossing of the Tisza, when he reportedly led the repulsion of 12 counterattacks. He was seriously wounded in the battle and was discharged. Postwar he worked as an engineer at a <b>factory</b> <b>equipment</b> supply factory.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>factory's</b> <b>equipment</b> {{and other}} {{automotive}} assets were auctioned {{off to a}} new company, [...] "MSTs6 AMO ZIL". It employs 47 staff, mostly former ZiL workers. The company {{took part in the}} Moscow International Automobile Salon 2016.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} a desire {{on the part of}} Soviet {{officials}} to forestall any evacuations until it was absolutely necessary, the marching orders were often to continue factory production until the eve of occupation before hurriedly dismantling and transporting <b>factory</b> <b>equipment,</b> and destroying what couldn't be moved in time. As a result of the delay in evacuations, they were often carried out under German aerial bombardment, which led to additional confusion among the frightened citizenry. Historian Rebecca Manley describes these early evacuations as being charactered by “three phenomena: the 'flight' of officials, the flight of the population, and 'panic'”.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of {{immediately}} {{entering the}} engineering workforce after earning his degree, DeLorean sold life insurance. He developed an analytical system aimed at engineers and sold [...] "about $850,000 worth of policies in ten months". But {{he found the}} work boring {{and moved on to}} work for the <b>Factory</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation. DeLorean states in his autobiography that he sold life insurance to improve his communications skills. Both endeavors were successful financially, but these areas held little interest for DeLorean. A foreman at Chrysler's engineering garage recommended that DeLorean apply for work at Chrysler and DeLorean agreed. Chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility named the Chrysler Institute of Engineering, which allowed DeLorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from experience, {{patronage}} {{from the}} likes of , an independent minded diplomat of [...] "sterling reputation", served to aid Hoveida's ascendance to the upper echelons of public office. With the government of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (king) of Iran, the only way to obtain high ranking positions in any societal position was through crucial internal patronage, reinforcement Hoveyda sufficiently lacked prior to working with Entezam. The two first got to work together when Hoveyda was stationed in Stuttgart, West Germany. While there in 1947, Hoveyda was assigned with the task of negotiating over deals made between Iran and Germany. The most notable case involved Iran's purchase of <b>factory</b> <b>equipment</b> required {{for the construction of a}} steel mill, in which the transaction of the material components were never successfully completed.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile in Ireland, the Irish War of Independence occurred. Production at Cork never flourished {{during this}} first period, {{although}} a few thousand tractors a year were built. Ford ended production at Cork in 1922 and shipped the <b>factory's</b> <b>equipment</b> back to the U.S. in 1923. (It would return some years later, as described below.) ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s Yugoslavia {{collapsed}} and war started in Croatia and Bosnia. International sanctions were {{imposed by the}} United Nations, which led to political isolation and economic decline for Serbia. This resulted in a crisis for the factory and its workers when PPT lost its ability to export products. Many high-profile engineers left Petoletka during the 1990s and started their own private companies. The state did not have funds to invest in <b>factory</b> machines and <b>equipment</b> and this resulted in most of <b>factory's</b> <b>equipment</b> becoming obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Norway's largest {{exports to}} China were crude oil, {{mechanical}} and electrical products, fertilizer, construction, mining <b>equipment,</b> <b>factory</b> and plant <b>equipment,</b> and salmon, {{as well as}} raw metals.|$|R
2500|$|He lost an eye in {{a factory}} {{accident}} and also suffered a severe blow to the chest from a piece of <b>factory</b> <b>equipment,</b> an injury that {{may have led to}} increasing attacks of angina. Despite these setbacks he exhibited an aircraft at Hempstead, New York, as late as 1915. He continued to work and invent. He designed a braking safety device, hoping to win a prize offered by a railroad. He demonstrated it as a scale model but won nothing. He constructed an [...] "automatic" [...] concrete-laying machine, which he used to help build a road north of Bridgeport. These inventions, however, brought him no more profit than did his airplanes and engines. Around 1915 Whitehead worked {{in a factory}} as a laborer and repaired motors to support his family.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the centennial}} {{anniversary of the}} {{founding}} of the company on November 1, 1958 the company employed 1820 workers and 549 salaried professionals. A new production facility for phosphates was opened in 1960. In the same year the factory produced [...] of KAMPKA fertilizer and [...] of sodium carbonate. In 1960 the Salzdetfurth AG acquired the remaining 25 percent of Chemische Fabrik Kalk. After the takeover the Salzdetfurth AG began to modernize the production facilities and build for example a new, [...] tall chimney that helped alleviate the odor pollution from sulfurous exhaust fumes. In the mid 1960s the fillings and loading plants were converted to fully automated operation. Despite these modernizations the <b>factory</b> <b>equipment,</b> in particular the sodium carbonate production facilities were outdated. The company also lacked new products that would have allowed the company to enter new markets.|$|E
2500|$|In the interior, both {{cars were}} far more different. The VAM car had {{woodgrain}} overlays over the front dashboard surfaces instead of brushed aluminum, digital tachometer, Hurst T-shaped shifter, VAM logo over the horn button, a [...] "Rally" [...] emblem over the glove box door, reclining front bucket seats with round border pattern on the fabric plus inhouse side and door panels. In the midyear, just like it happened with the grille, VAM replaced the round border pattern of with a horizontal-line design {{in one or two}} tones due to criticism and rejection from customers. Mechanically, the model is restricted to a single engine, the [...] VAM [...] inline six cylinder engine with TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage or optional Chrysler TorqueFlyte A998 three-speed automatic transmission with a 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio. <b>Factory</b> <b>equipment</b> included power front disk and rear drum brakes, power steering, front sway bar, heavy duty springs and shocks, as well as D70×14 radial tires.|$|E

2500|$|In early August, Germany and the Soviet Union {{finalized}} {{the terms}} {{for an economic}} agreement, but the Soviets delayed executing that agreement until {{the terms of the}} political agreement with Germany were finalized. [...] On August 19, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials. [...] The agreement provided that Germany would accept 200 million Reichmarks in new orders over 7 years with an effective interest rate of 4.5 percent and would export 60 million Reichmarks in [...] "current business" [...] (trade covered by earlier agreements), 180 million Reichmarks in [...] "new business" [...] and another 200-300 million Reichmarks in repayment for old and new credits. The credit line was to be used during the next two years for purchase of capital goods (<b>factory</b> <b>equipment,</b> installations, machinery and machine tools, ships, vehicles, and other means of transport) in Germany [...] and was to be paid off by means of [...] Soviet material shipment from 1946 onwards.|$|E
2500|$|The German–Soviet Credit Agreement (also {{referred}} to as the German–Soviet Trade and Credit Agreement) [...] was an economic arrangement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany whereby Soviet Union received an [...] acceptance credit of 200 million Reichsmark. over 7 years with an effective interest rate of 4.5 percent. The credit line was to be used during the next two years for purchase of capital goods (<b>factory</b> <b>equipment,</b> installations, machinery and machine tools, ships, vehicles, and other means of transport) in Germany [...] and was to be paid off by means of [...] Soviet material shipment from 1946 onwards. The economic agreement was the first step toward improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Germany. The next day after the Credit Agreement, the Soviet Union went to war against Japan, in a successful four-week military campaign in the Far East. The Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed four days after the Credit Agreement. The 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement renewed declined Nazi–Soviet economic relations and was adjusted and expanded with the larger German–Soviet Commercial Agreement in February 1940 and January 1941 German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement. German shipments to the Soviets became tardy and failed to provide all that was promised the closer the date of Barbarossa came. The Soviets fulfilled their obligations to the letter right up until the invasion, wanting to avoid provoking Germany. All these agreements were terminated when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, in violation of the treaties between the two countries. Soviet trade with Germany in the pre-invasion period ended up providing the Germans with many of the resources they needed for their invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|By 1914 {{the plants}} in Douai covered over 86,000 m2 and the Société Arbel was {{employing}} 2500 workers. The factory was occupied by German troops during the First World War from October 1914; during {{the latter part of}} the war the occupation became destructive with assets removed, and later destroyed in situ. By the recapture of the plant in 1918 essentially all the <b>factory's</b> <b>equipment</b> had been looted, and much of the buildings also removed or destroyed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the final}} months of World War II the <b>factory's</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was seized by}} the Germans and sent to Germany, {{while most of the}} {{buildings}} were demolished.
