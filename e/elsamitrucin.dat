40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{antitumor}} activity of <b>Elsamitrucin</b> in metastatic {{cancer of the}} breast, colon and rectum, non-small cell lung and ovary. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility required histologically proven cancer. Patients with colorectal or {{non-small cell lung cancer}} could not have received prior chemotherapy. Patients were entered if WHO PS was < or = 2 and organ functions were normal. Treatment consisted of <b>Elsamitrucin</b> 25 mg/m 2 /week given as a 5 - 10 min infusion for at least 3 - 6 weekly doses. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients entered the studies, 97 were eligible, 94 are evaluable for toxicity and 75 for response. Toxicity mainly consisted of mild nausea/vomiting, and less frequently reversible hepatotoxicity and malaise. No objective responses were seen. CONCLUSION: <b>Elsamitrucin</b> at this dose and schedule is not an active drug in metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or ovarian cancer.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{undertook}} a prospective, randomized phase III trial {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of using a phase II agent before initiating therapy with standard combination chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 365 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either immediate chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or up to four cycles of one of five sequential cohorts of single-agent drugs: trimetrexate, melphalan, amonafide, carboplatin, or <b>elsamitrucin,</b> followed by CAF. RESULTS: The toxicity of each single agent followed by CAF was {{comparable to that of}} CAF alone. The cumulative response rates for the single agent followed by CAF were not statistically different from those of CAF alone (44 % v 52 %; P =. 24). However, in the multivariate analysis, patients with visceral disease had a trend toward lower response rates on the phase II agent plus CAF arm (P =. 078). Although survival and response duration also were not statistically significantly different between the two study arms (P =. 074 and P =. 069, respectively), there was a suggestion of benefit for the CAF-only arm. CONCLUSION: The brief use of a phase II agent, regardless of its efficacy, followed by CAF resulted in response rates, toxicities, durations of response, and survival statistically equivalent to those seen with the use of CAF alone. These findings support the use of a new paradigm for the evaluation of phase II agents in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer...|$|E
