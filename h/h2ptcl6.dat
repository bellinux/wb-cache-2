500|$|Pure {{platinum}} is a lustrous, ductile, and malleable, silver-white metal. Platinum is more ductile than gold, silver or copper, thus {{being the}} most ductile of pure metals, but it is less malleable than gold. The metal has excellent resistance to corrosion, is stable at high temperatures and has stable electrical properties. Platinum reacts with oxygen slowly at very high temperatures. It reacts vigorously with fluorine at [...] to form platinum tetrafluoride. It is also attacked by chlorine, bromine, iodine, and sulfur. Platinum is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid, but dissolves in hot aqua regia(nitric acid hydrochloride), to form chloroplatinic acid, <b>H2PtCl6.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chloroplatinic acid or hexachloroplatinic acid is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula 2(H2O)x.

50|$|Ammonium hexachloroplatinate {{is used in}} {{platinum}} plating. Heating (NH4)2PtCl6 under {{a stream}} of hydrogen at 200 °C produces platinum sponge. Treating this with chlorine gives <b>H2PtCl6.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} {{convenient}} since the chloroplatinic acid is generated readily from Pt metal. Aqueous solutions of <b>H2PtCl6</b> {{can also be}} reduced with hydrazinium salts, but this method is more laborious than the thermal route of Kerr and Schweizer.|$|E
50|$|Adams's {{catalyst}} {{is prepared}} from chloroplatinic acid <b>H2PtCl6</b> or ammonium chloroplatinate, (NH4)2PtCl6, by fusion with sodium nitrate. The first published preparation {{was reported by}} V. Voorhees and Roger Adams. The procedure involves first preparing a platinum nitrate which is then heated to expel nitrogen oxides.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} method of synthesis involves the coreduction of chloroplatinic acid (<b>H2PtCl6)</b> and iron (II) chloride in water-in-oil microemulsions. In this process, the normal face-centered cubic structure is transformed to a face-centered tetragonal configuration, offering a higher density product useful for many storage media applications.|$|E
50|$|For hydrosilylation, <b>H2PtCl6</b> ("Speier's catalyst") is an {{important}} catalyst. Mechanisms for this catalytic system usually assume intermediates that contain hydride, silyl ligand (R3Si), and alkene ligands. Cis-dichlorobis(diethyl sulfide)platinum(II) and Karstedt’s catalyst (adduct of divinyltetramethyldisiloxane and chloroplatinic acid) also catalyse hydrosilylation. Many metallodendrimers have repeating units based on organoplatinum compounds.|$|E

50|$|Some common {{examples}} of platinum precursors include potassium hexachloroplatinate (K2PtCl6) or platinous chloride (PtCl2) Different combinations of precursors, such as ruthenium chloride (RuCl3) and chloroplatinic acid (<b>H2PtCl6),</b> {{have been used}} to synthesize mixed-metal nanoparticles Some {{common examples}} of reducing agents include hydrogen gas (H2), sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), although other alcohols and plant-derived compounds have also been used.|$|E
50|$|Typical of Pt(IV), {{the metal}} centers adopt an {{octahedral}} coordination geometry, {PtCl6}. This geometry {{is achieved by}} forming a polymer wherein half of the chloride ligands bridge between the platinum centers. Because of its polymeric structure, PtCl4 dissolves only upon breaking the chloride bridging ligands. Thus, addition of HCl give <b>H2PtCl6.</b> Lewis base adducts of Pt(IV) of the type cis-PtCl4L2 are known, but most are prepared by oxidation of the Pt(II) derivatives.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrosilylation {{is related}} to hydrogenation, and similar {{catalysts}} are sometimes employed for the two catalytic processes. Popular industrial catalysts are [...] "Speier's catalyst," [...] <b>H2PtCl6,</b> and Karstedt’s catalyst, an alkene-stabilized platinum(0) catalyst. [...] One prevalent mechanism, called the Chalk-Harrod mechanism, assumes an intermediate metal complex that contains a hydride, a silyl ligand (R3Si), and the alkene substrate. The reaction usually produces anti-Markovnikov addition alkane, i.e., silicon on the terminal carbon. [...] Variations of the Chalk-Harrod mechanism. Some cases involve insertion of alkene into M-Si bond followed by reductive elimination, {{the opposite of the}} sequence in the Chalk-Harrod mechanism. In certain cases, hydrosilylation results in vinyl or allylic silanes resulting from beta-hydride elimination. These reactions can also be catalyzed using nanomaterial-based catalysts.|$|E
40|$|Novel metal {{nanoparticles}} of Pd and Pt {{were prepared}} by sonochemical reduction of solutions containing <b>H₂PtCl₆</b> or K₂PdCl₄. The effect of atmospheric gas on the {{particle size distribution}} was investigated. Average diameters {{and standard deviations of}} the Pd particles prepared under Ar (Pd/Ar) and N 2 (Pd/N₂) were found to be 3. 6 ± 0. 7 nm (Pd/Ar) and 2. 0 ± 0. 3 nm (Pd/N₂). Smaller and sharper distribution of the particle size was observed for the Pd particles formed under a N₂ atmosphere. In the case of Pt, a smaller and sharper distribution of the particle size was observed for the particles prepared under a Xe atmosphere. These relations can be explained in terms of a hot-spot temperature created by acoustic cavitation...|$|E
