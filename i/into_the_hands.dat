At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of successive tyrants.|$|E
