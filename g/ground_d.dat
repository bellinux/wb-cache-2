When treated with reactive oxygen species, its protective effect can be maximized by blanching with hypochlorite ion. Preparation time directly affects its anti-oxidant ability. Caffeoyl quinic acid from its extract has shown to display inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase.|$|E

40|$|The {{above ground}} biomass of Sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria) in the {{community}} forest of Bateh Village were estimated by developing allometric equations. To establish the allometric equations, 400 sample trees were measured to determine the relationships between tree height (H) and stem diameter at breast height (D). Eighteen trees of various sizes were cut to measure the above ground biomass (stem, branch and leaves).

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for any thermal protection system (TPS) of a probe is to provide a sufficient barrier for heat generated during descent {{in order to keep the}} temperature inside of the probe low enough to support operational temperature of equipment. Typically, such a goal is achieved by having the ceramic tiles and blankets like on the Space Shuttle, silicon based ablators, or metallic systems to cover the probe external surface. This paper discusses the development of an innovative technique for TPS of the probe. It is proposed to use a novel TPS which comprises thermal management of the entry vehicle. It includes: a) absorption of the heat during heat pick load by a Phase Change Material (PCM), b) separation of the compartment which contains PCM from the rest of the space vehicle by a gap with a high thermal resistance, c) maintaining temperature of the internal wall of s/c cabin temperature by transfer heat from the internal wall to the "cold" side of the vehicle and to reject heat into the space during the flight and on a <b>ground,</b> <b>d)</b> utilization of an advanced heat pipe, so called Loop Heat Pipe to transfer heat from the cabin internal wall to the cold side of the s/c and to reject the heat into environment outside of the vehicle.

Aiming to bring further insight into this topic, the present work seeks to evaluate the influence of sodium chloride on the leaching of chalcopyrite focusing on surface area and porosity of the reaction products formed during leaching. A finely <b>ground</b> (<b>d</b> 50 = 5. 5 μm) chalcopyrite concentrate assaying 25. 2 % iron, 30. 9 % sulphur and 27. 5 % copper was leached in oxygenated ferric sulphate solutions at atmospheric pressure and 95 °C. It has been observed that although sodium chloride favoured natrojarosite precipitation, which reduced the total iron concentration during leaching, copper extractions as high as 91 % were accomplished as compared to 45 % copper extraction in the absence of NaCl. It is suggested that sodium chloride reduces chalcopyrite passivation and complexes Cu (I) ions adding a second redox couple to the system. Furthermore, morphologic characterization of the reaction products performed by SEM analyses as well as specific surface area and porosity measurements have confirmed that NaCl increases surface area and porosity of the product layer, which explains the high copper extractions observed {{in the presence of the}} salt...|$|E

By 1980 a serious economic and political crisis called for a reassessment of economic policies. Policy reorientation was radical : from import substitution to export promotion, from interventionism to market forces, and from promotion of SEEs to promotion of the private sector. The state's role in the economy was reduced and emphasis has instead been put on broadly defined privatization, with the additional objectives of developing the domestic capital markets and generating revenue for the treasury. Initial operations were {{in the form of}} sales of revenue-sharing bonds and minority share sales. The first attempt at stock sales flopped. The approach was then quietly switched to block sales without thorough preparation of the legal <b>ground.</b> <b>d.</b> Since the government had not prepared the legal and political base for privatization, it had no clear strategy or concrete program. The assumption that privatization could be treated as an administrative matter was proven wrong.

For the moment, privatization has thus shrunk to a budget-deficit financing technique, with the targets of enhanced efficiency pushed into the background.

This study combined positive psychology and job loss perspectives to investigate the subjective experience of well-being following job loss. Using a qualitative-focused case study methodology, this three article dissertation explored the experiences of 20 workers who were displaced from the Ottawa, Canada technology sector from 2000 - 2006. The first article explored the experience of well-being from a bottom-up, naturalistic point of view and compared these inductive notions with existing a priori theories. Findings support integrated conceptualizations of hedonia and eudaimonia, while also potentially identifying new notions of well-being. Identified themes include (a) life evaluation, (b) transitory experiencing, (c) growth and <b>grounding,</b> (<b>d)</b> environmental mastery/stability, (e) mental ill-being/ill-health, and (f) motivational mindsets/conditions. This study showed well-being to be a rich, pluralistic construct. It included the non-dualistic notions of both subjectivity and objectivity, as well as encompassing notions related to the what and how of well-being. The second and third articles present inductively derived themes which helped to explain the relationship between job loss and well-being (i. e., the how and why). Three externally focused themes were reported in the second article: (a) systemic factors (e. g., broader business environment), (b) interpersonal factors (e. g., social support), and (c) chance (e. g., luck and serendipity). The third article identified two internally focused major themes: (a) differential coping responses and processes and (b) protective and sensitizing processes. Coping specifically consisted of problem-focused coping, meaning-making, attitudes and expectancies, behavioural processes, and emotional processes. Protective and sensitizing processes included identity and self-esteem, the impact of past adversity, and personal resources and characteristics. Implications for theory, research, and practice for both positive psychology and job loss are discussed.

The first chapter of the Ph. D. thesis includes the review of the up-to-date scientific research bibliography, associated with the transient behaviour of grounding systems. The papers are grouped in this review, according to their content, as follows: a) the steady state b) the transient state, c) the resistivity and multi-layer structure of the <b>ground,</b> <b>d)</b> the ionisation of the soil and e) the methodologies of simulation of grounding systems. The experimental arrangements and the methods of tests and measurements, which have been used in the present thesis, are in detail described in its second chapter. These arrangements are used for the experimental study of a) the transient behaviour of grounding systems, b) the soil ionisation and c) the soil resistivity and the grounding resistance. The third chapter includes the presentation and {{the investigation of the}} experimental results and the arisen conclusions. The used experimental approaches (experiments in scale model, experiments in real grounding systems and experiments studying the soil ionisation) have essentially contributed in the elaboration, the inference and the verification of the suppositions of the present study. This verification is also proved through the convergence between experimental and computed (using the circuital and field approach) results of this Ph. D. thesis. The fourth chapter presents several simulation methods (circuital and field approach) of the transient behaviour of grounding systems and comparisons between the experimental and simulation results of this work, with relevant results of other researchers. The chapter also presents a proposed methodology, which uses a developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the calculation of the parameters of the multi-layer structure of the ground. In the end, a method of Monte-Carlo simulation is applied, which evaluates the grounding resistance of towers of a transmission line. The conclusions are summarized in the fifth chapter, showing clearly the contribution of the present study in the research of the transient behaviour of grounding systems. ...|$|E

The crop was installed at 7. 0 m 7. 0 m spacing, irrigated by a microsprinkle irrigation system with 50 L. h- 1 emitters. The results showed that the water and interaction water and potassium were significant to none parameters analyzed. Potassium influenced significantly height of the plant and diameter of trunk below of the coastal. The height of plant presented significant influence on water level only on the treatment were none potassium was applied. As to total nutrients in the plants: potassium, iron and sodium in a plant, only potassium presented compatible significant (8. 1 %) to water. To crop in studies water deficit didnât limited growing of dwarfish cashew tree. O principal objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar o efeito das lÃminas de Ãgua, dos nÃveis de potÃssio e sua interaÃÃo sobre as variÃveis relacionadas ao crescimento vegetativo (altura da planta, diÃmetro do caule abaixo e acima do enxerto) e ao estado nutricional (potÃssio, ferro e sÃdio) do cajueiro anÃo-precoce (Anacardium occidentale L.) variedade BRS 189. Para isto foi realizado um experimento no nÃcleo D do PerÃmetro Irrigado Curu-Pentecoste, CearÃ, no perÃodo de setembro de 2005 a fevereiro de 2007. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos completos casualizados com parcelas subdivididas, composto de quatro tratamentos primÃrios nas parcelas, quatro tratamentos secundÃrios nas subparcelas e quatro blocos. Os tratamentos primÃrios constituÃram-se da combinaÃÃo de quatro lÃminas de irrigaÃÃo (W 1 = 25 % ETc; W 2 = 50 % ETc; W 3 = 100 % ETc; W 4 = 150 % ETc) com quatro nÃveis de adubaÃÃo potÃssica (K 0 = 0 g; K 1 = 30 g; K 2 = 60 g; K 3 = 120 g de K 2 O. planta- 1. ano- 1) localizados nas subparcelas. A cultura foi instalada no espaÃamento de 7, 0 m x 7, 0 m, irrigada por um sistema de irrigaÃÃo localizada tipo microaspersÃo, com microaspersores autocompensantes de 50 L. h- 1 de vazÃo. ApÃs anÃlise dos resultados verificou-se que o fator Ãgua e sua interaÃÃo nÃo apresentaram efeitos significativos em nÃvel de 5 % sobre nenhuma das variÃveis analisadas. O fator potÃssio influenciou significativamente a altura de plantas e o diÃmetro do caule abaixo do enxerto em nÃveis de 5 %. A altura das plantas foi significativamente influenciada em nÃvel inferior a 5 %, pelo fator Ãgua, apenas para o tratamento em que nÃo ocorreu aplicaÃÃo de potÃssio. Quanto Ã concentraÃÃo dos nutrientes: potÃssio, ferro e sÃdio nas folhas, apenas o teor de potÃssio se apresentou com nÃveis de significÃncia compatÃveis (8, 1 %) em relaÃÃo ao fator Ãgua. Com base nas variÃveis analisadas, o dÃficit hÃdrico nÃo se apresentou limitante ao desenvolvimento da cultura do cajueiro anÃo-precoce...|$|E

The Distributed Collaborative Design Studio (DCDS) is a remote workspace environment aiming to emulate, at a distance, the conditions of face-to-face meetings. It is designed to allow designers to interact collaboratively at distance on a shared workspace, thanks to «natural» pen-based interaction. This documents sharing and real-time collaborative annotations are supposed to enhance awareness and <b>grounding</b> dur- <b>ing</b> collaboration in design domains. In this chapter, we explicit the theoretical rationale for sharing in collaborative design, briefly describe the DCDS, summarize the observations we made relative to resources sharing (plans, pictures, documents and so on), and conclude on the theoretical and methodological issues to be addressed to deepen our knowledge about sharing external representations in design, to enhance the system and to adapt it to other contexts.

40|$|The flame born in {{the deep}} {{interior}} of a white dwarf that becomes a Type Ia supernova is subject to several instabilities, the combination of which determines the observational characteristics of the explosion. We briefly review these instabilities and discuss the length scales for which each dominates. Their cumulative effect is to accelerate {{the speed of the}} flame beyond its laminar value, but that acceleration has uncertain time and angle dependence which has allowed numerous solutions to be proposed (e. g., deflagration, delayed detonation, pulsational deflagration, and pulsational detonation). We discuss the conditions necessary for each of these events and the attendant uncertainties. A grid of critical masses for detonation in the range 10 7 - 2 Θ 10 9 g cm Γ 3 is calculated and its sensitivity to composition explored. The conditions for prompt detonation are discussed. Such explosions are physically improbable and appear unlikely on observational <b>grounds.</b> Simple <b>d</b> [...] ...|$|R

Since we have in mind a background that renders the effective action stationary we make no use of the classical field equations. We find that the requirement that the four-space be flat is very restrictive. It requires all components of the background four-index field to vanish and the compact manifold to be Ricci-flat and hence to have at most the abelian symmetries associated with tori. © 1984...|$|R

The antennas described here were designed at 2 - 3 GHz to meet the size and bandwidth constraints of multimedia sensor networks. Their performance was characterized in terms of electrical size, bandwidth, and broadband radiation efficiency. We also studied compact printed arrays built with sinusoidal monopoles; we designed a two-element MEA and tested its behavior for interelement spacing ranging from 0. 25 λ 0 to 0. 10 λ 0. Array response was characterized in terms of VSWR bandwidth, mutual coupling, and broadband envelope correlation. Results show that densely-packed compact arrays feature controllable element detuning, whereas envelope correlation stays below 0. 5 even for λ 0 / 10 spacing. If coupling and correlation suppression is needed, we describe a simple yet effective technique that offers multi-decibel gains. It is based on disturbance of the ground currents by insertion of a defect...|$|R
