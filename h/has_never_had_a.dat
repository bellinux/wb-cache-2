5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{coaches have}} won the award in the same season that they have also won a National Coach of the Year award; of those, only Krzyzewski and Smith have {{achieved}} the feat three times. Four coaches have won during the same season that they have coached a team that won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Frank McGuire, Norm Sloan, Dean Smith, and Gary Williams. North Carolina has the most ACC Coach of the Year awards with 12, while its in-state rival, Duke, is second with 10. Frank McGuire is the only head coach to win the award at two different schools (North Carolina and South Carolina). Each of the original 1953ACC members {{have had at least}} one of their coaches win the award. Among schools that joined the ACC before 2013, Boston College {{is the only one that}} <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> winning coach.

5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed {{some time ago}} and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they {{were killed in the}} attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode, leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E

40|$|Questions Should {{patients}} with newly diagnosed brain tumours re-ceive prophylactic anticonvulsants to reduce seizure risk? What {{is the best}} practice for {{patients with}} brain tumours who are taking anticonvulsant medications but who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> seizure? Perspectives Patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> seizure still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 20 % risk of ex-periencing a seizure {{over the course of}} their disease. Because considerable practice variation exists in re-gard to the management of patients with brain tumours who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> seizure, and because conflict-ing evidence has been reported, the Neuro-oncology Disease Site Group (DSG) of Cancer Care Ontario’s Program in Evidence-based Care felt that a system-atic review of the evidence was warranted. Outcomes Outcomes of interest were incidence of seizures and adverse effects of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy...|$|R
