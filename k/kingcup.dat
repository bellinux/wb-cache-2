6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or <b>kingcup,</b> yellow flag, sea poppy, marsh marigold, or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and eyebright, than you can say of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E

A wild cherry, all silver white, was behind their Altar, the green floor was marbled with cuckoo flowers and buttercups, and the clear little stream whose voice murmured by was fringed with <b>kingcups</b> and forget-me-nots.

It stood {{at the foot of a}} rising ground, on which grew a grove of {{magnificent}} beeches, their large silvery boles rising majestically like columns into a lofty vaulting of branches, covered above with tender green foliage. Here and there the shade beneath was broken by the gilding of a ray of sunshine on a lower twig, or on a white trunk, but the floor of the vast arcades was almost entirely of the russet brown of the fallen leaves, save where a fern or holly bush made a spot of green. At the foot of the slope lay a stretch of pasture ground, some parts covered by [...] "lady-smocks, all silver white," [...] with the course of the little stream through the midst indicated by a perfect golden river of shining <b>kingcups</b> interspersed with ferns.

But all was silent now, not a house was open, the rising sun made the eastern windows of the churches a blaze of light, and from the west door of St. Paul's the city beneath seemed sleeping, only a wreath or two of smoke rising.

No mountain passions were to be allowed in him.

He had to be left with his <b>kingcups</b> and clover;--pansies--the passing clouds--the Avon's flow--and the undulating hills and woods of Warwick; nay, he was not to love even these in any exceeding measure, lest it might make him in the least overrate their power upon the strong, full-fledged minds of men. He makes the quarrelling fairies concerned about them; poor lost Ophelia find some comfort in them; fearful, fair, wise-hearted Perdita trust the speaking of her good will and good hostess-ship to them; and one of the brothers of Imogen confide his sorrow to them,--rebuked instantly by his brother for [...] "wench-like words;[111]" [...] but any thought of them in his mighty men I do not find: it is not usually in the nature of such men; and if he had loved the flowers the least better himself, he would assuredly have been offended at this, and given a botanical turn of mind to Cæsar, or Othello.|$|R
