50|$|Microchess, by Peter R. Jennings, was {{originally}} a microcomputer chess {{program for the}} MOS Technology KIM-1 microcomputer, first released on December 18, 1976. Microchess, as small {{as it was in}} terms of program size, could still play passable chess on the KIM-1 with its 6502 microprocessor, 1 kilobyte of memory, simple <b>hex</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and seven-segment display.|$|E
50|$|Yunij Technik (Young Engineer) {{magazine}} released {{details for}} one DIY home computer, the UT-88, {{which was published}} in 1988. It was a step back to the Micro-80 conception but was much simpler and used very widespread elements, which made it available for less skilled hobbyists. It was divided into a few blocks, starting from a single-board microcomputer with LED display and <b>HEX</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and later adding more RAM, TV interface, and complete keyboard.|$|E
50|$|Input is {{done with}} a <b>hex</b> <b>keyboard</b> that has 16 keys which range from 0 to F. The '8', '4', '6', and '2' keys are {{typically}} used for directional input. Three opcodes are used to detect input. One skips an instruction if a specific key is pressed, while another does the same if a specific key is not pressed. The third waits for a key press, and then stores {{it in one of}} the data registers.|$|E
5000|$|In the ASCII and Unicode {{character}} sets, {{this character}} is encoded {{by the number}} 26 (1A <b>hex).</b> Standard <b>keyboards</b> transmit this code when the [...] and [...] keys are pressed simultaneously (Ctrl+Z, by convention often described as ^Z).|$|R
40|$|Many {{traditional}} and new musical instruments {{make use of}} an isomorphic note layout across a uniform planar tessel-lation. Recently, a number of hexagonal isomorphic key-boards have become available commercially. Each such keyboard or interface uses a single specific layout for notes, with specific justifications as to why this or that layout is better. This paper is an exploration of all possible note layouts on isomorphic tessellations. We begin with an in-vestigation and proof of isomorphism in the two regular planar tessellations (Square and hexagonal), we describe the history and current practice of isomorphic note layouts from traditional stringed instruments to commercial <b>hex</b> <b>keyboards</b> and virtual keyboards available on tablet com-puters, and we investigate the complete space of such lay-outs, evaluating the existing popular layouts and proposing a set of new layouts which are optimized for specific mu-sical tasks. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In macOS the [...] "Emoji & Symbols" [...] (...) menu can {{be found}} in the Edit menu in many programs. This brings up the Characters palette {{allowing}} the user to choose any character from a variety of views. The user can then also search for the character or Unicode plane by name. In Mac OS 8.5 and later: one chooses the Unicode <b>Hex</b> Input <b>keyboard</b> layout; in OS X Yosemite, this can be added in Keyboard->Input Sources. Holding down the , one then types the four-digit hex Unicode code point and the equivalent character appears. One can then release the [...] key. Characters outside of the BMP exceed the four-digit limit of the Unicode hex input mechanism but can be entered using the search entry box in the Character Viewer (Edit â†’ Emoji & Symbols) or by using surrogate pairs. [...] To use surrogate pairs, hold down the [...] key, the first surrogate, the [...] key (shift key is ignored), the second surrogate and then release the Option key.|$|R
5000|$|A simple 4-kilobit (512-byte) {{operating}} system was built into its ROM. It allowed one to type in programs using its <b>hex</b> <b>keyboard,</b> show memory contents on its display (step through the bytes of RAM), and view {{the values of}} the processor registers. The ROM monitor was accessed by holding the [...] "C" [...] key while switching from Reset to Run. The COSMAC VIP was shipped with 20 video games, which were programmed in CHIP-8. CHIP-8 was an early interpreted programming language that was used on this machine and other early microcomputers, such as the Telmac 1800. The video games that were provided came as a list of instructions which had to be typed in by the user.|$|E
5000|$|The machine {{connected}} {{to either a}} video monitor or to a TV with video input or {{by means of an}} external RF modulator. The VIP used a CDP1861/CDP1864 video display chip to generate the video output, and sound could be played using its integrated speaker. It had a 100 bytes per second cassette tape interface as well. Programs could be loaded into RAM from tapes, and vice versa. It also had a <b>hex</b> <b>keyboard</b> for input, which had 16 keys spanning the hex digits 0 to F. LED indicators were used to display power status and tape input; a third LED along with an on-board beeper were activated by the CPU's 1-bit [...] "Q" [...] register. A run/reset switch was used to start user programs or the operating system, respectively.|$|E
