It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> clear when you listen to it.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on emotions in intergroup relations, {{it is not always}} clear how exactly <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> group-related. Here, we distinguish between emotions that involve appraisals of immediate group concerns (i. e., group-based emotions) and emotions that do not. Recently, general group emotions, measured by asking people how they feel "as a group member" but without specifying an object for these <b>emotions,</b> have <b>been</b> conceptualized as reflecting appraisals of group concerns. In contrast, we propose that general group <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> best seen as emotions about belonging to a group. In two studies, general group <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> closely related to <b>emotions</b> that <b>are</b> explicitly measured as belonging emotions. Two further studies showed that general group <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> not related to appraisals of immediate group concerns, whereas group-based <b>emotions</b> <b>were.</b> We argue for more specificity regarding the group-level aspects of <b>emotion</b> that <b>are</b> tapped by <b>emotion</b> measures...|$|R
5000|$|According to some theories, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> {{universal}} phenomena, albeit {{affected by}} culture. <b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> [...] "internal phenomena that can, {{but do not}} always, make themselves observable through expression and behavior". While some <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> universal and are experienced in similar ways {{as a reaction to}} similar events across all cultures, other emotions show considerable cultural differences in their antecedent events, the way they are experienced, the reactions they provoke and the way they are perceived by the surrounding society. According to other theories, termed social constructionist, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> more deeply culturally influenced. The components of <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> universal, but the patterns are social constructions. Some also theorize that culture <b>is</b> affected by <b>emotions</b> of the people.|$|R
25|$|In modern {{scientific}} thought, certain refined {{emotions are}} considered a complex neural trait innate {{in a variety of}} domesticated and non-domesticated mammals. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} {{evidence}} {{it can be}} concluded that exposure to the social sharing of an <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> itself an emotion-eliciting event, it would follow that the listener too would later share that experience with other people. Christophe et Rimé called this subsequent phenomenon secondary social sharing of emotions. In other words, the receiver of the social sharing will consequently experience some kind of emotion, so the receiver will then become a transmitter of the narration as a part of their emotional experience of hearing the story.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} fresco painters {{were active}} in Padua in the late 14th century, Altichiero and Giusto de' Menabuoi. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the Cathedral's Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare Apocalypse cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> conservative by comparison with that of Altichiero's Crucifixion at the Basilica of Sant'Antonio, also in Padua. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this chapter, {{we first}} {{introduce}} {{the idea that}} <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations. Next, we explore two approaches attempting to account for this idea in terms of attitudes that are alleged to become emotional when taking evaluative contents. According to the first approach, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluative judgments. According to the second, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> perceptual experiences of evaluative properties. We explain why this theory remains unsatisfactory insofar as it shares with the evaluative judgement theory the idea that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations in virtue of their contents. We then outline an alternative – the attitudinal theory of emotions. It parts with current theorizing about the emotions in elucidating the fact that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations {{not in terms of}} what they represent, but in terms of the attitude subjects take towards what they represent. We explore what sorts of attitudes <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> and claim that they are felt bodily attitudes...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} a precise {{definition}} of <b>emotions</b> <b>is</b> neither necessary nor possible prior to empirical research on <b>emotions.</b> It <b>is</b> not necessary because {{all that is needed}} for for fruitful research and successful communication is a working definition of emotions, a description that allows to roughly demarcate the class of <b>emotions.</b> It <b>is</b> not possible because precise <b>emotion</b> definitions <b>are</b> real definitions, empirical claims about the essence of emotions. These claims about the nature of <b>emotion</b> <b>are</b> always formulated against the background of a theory of emotion generation, whose truth they presuppose. The claim that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> syndromes of mental and behavioral states is such a theoretical definition of <b>emotion.</b> It <b>is</b> put into question by the finding of low correlations between the proposed syndrome components. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
25|$|To {{the right}} of the massacre, stands the image Jesus and the Four Evangelists. This carving {{introduces}} the next relief panel depicting the Crucifixion. In the center on the panel Jesus hangs upon the cross traditionally shown with his head falling to the side and modestly covered in a loin cloth. A new addition that Nicola made to the crucified Savior is the joining of Christ’s feet upon the cross with one nail. This had not been seen before the 13th century. Surrounding Jesus is a scene of onlookers and mourners. To the left of Christ stands the image of Mary physically grieving. Her stance and <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> another motif of the 13th century as it became common to depict the Virgin as swooning. This panel is also a good example of Nicolas understanding of depth with the foreground figures being the largest.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} we are passive victims of our <b>emotions,</b> that they <b>are</b> wild and {{uncontrollable}} things which just happen to (or "in") us is very common. Robert Solomon thinks that this idea stems from a faulty philosophical analysis: the analysis that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> a kind of "feeling" or physiological happening. On this analysis, "feelings" and occurrences are externally caused; as such they are non-rational and involuntary, the types {{of things that we}} cannot be held responsible for. In his seminal article "Emotions and Choice. " Solomon opposes this view. He wants to show that we can be held accountable for our emotions, even praised or blamed for having them. To achieve this end, he shows that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> rational events, and hence are importantly conceptual events. Taken to its logical conclusion, Solomon proposes that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> judgments. That explains, in a way in which the traditional view can't explain, why <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> subject to rational control and conscious manipulation, and therefore why we can rightly be held accountable for them. In this thesis I agree with Solomon that the intentionality of <b>emotions</b> cannot <b>be</b> accounted for by a "Components" model. What I don't agree with <b>is</b> that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments. If <b>emotions</b> really <b>are</b> a species of judgment (and I see no reason why the reverse might not be true, that judgments are a kind of emotion), then Solomon has given no adequate reason for his implicit view that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments. When we look more closely at Soloman's view of judgments, we see that he wobbles between a non-componential and a componential analysis. Since it is his thesis that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> importantly non-componential, and that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> judgments, this wobbliness jeopardises Soloman's entire philosophical project. After examining the second half of "Emotions and Choice", I conclude that Soloman's strongest reason for thinking <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments really {{has nothing to do with}} the nature of judgments at all. It is because he is covertly, and maybe unwittingly, holding a view of emotions as self-deceptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of emotion researchers reject the feeling theory of emotions; they deny that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings. Some of these researchers admit that emotions have feelings as components, but {{they insist that}} emotions contain other compo-nents as well, such as cognitions. I argue for a qualified version of the feeling theory. I present evidence in support William James’s conjecture that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> perceptions of patterned changes in the body. When such perceptions are conscious, they qualify as feelings. But the bodily perceptions constituting emo-tions can occur unconsciously. When that occurs, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> unfelt. Thus, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings when conscious, {{and they are not}} feelings when uncon-scious. In the end of the paper, I briefly sketch a theory of how emotions and other perceptual states become conscious. According to one strand in folk psychology, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings; they are phe-nomenally conscious mental episodes. This little morsel of commonsense is a whipping post in philosophy.

2500|$|Emotion has a {{significant}} influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked.

40|$|This study reports {{quantitative}} research into two basic dimensions of emotions: pleasantness and arousal.

Nine <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be exciting, namely energetic, euphoria, amusement, desire, joy, love, inspiration, lust and surprise. Ten <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be median in arousal, namely fascination, satisfaction, confidence, pride, anticipation, enchant- ment, courage, hope, worship and admiration. Six <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be calm, namely relaxation, relief, kindness, dreaminess, respect and sympathy. Three levels of pleasantness were also identified: ‘very pleasant’, ‘mildly pleasant’ and ‘pleasant’. Six <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be very pleasant, namely amusement, joy, satisfaction, inspiration, euphoria and love.
