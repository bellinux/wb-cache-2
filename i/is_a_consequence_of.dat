5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's {{characteristics}} are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. The inability to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that the}} star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, {{is determined by}} plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E
5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt {{in response to a}} current of one amp.|$|E
