5|$|In 1771 at age 19, Clark {{left his}} home on his first {{surveying}} trip into western Virginia. In 1772, {{he made his first}} trip into Kentucky via the Ohio River at Pittsburgh and spent the next two years surveying the Kanawha River region, as well as learning about the area's natural history and customs of the <b>Indians</b> <b>who</b> lived there. In the meantime, thousands of settlers were entering the area {{as a result of the}} Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768.|$|E

The latter had his face painted in peculiar wavy streaks which the trader had seen twice before.|$|R

5|$|In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, {{founder of}} the Immigration Voice forum, {{initiated}} a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Over a three-day period, hundreds of flower bouquets {{were sent to the}} United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office by <b>Indians</b> <b>who</b> were legally in the US but caught in a green card backlog. On 17 July, the USCIS reversed the decision that led to the protest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> {{were seeking}} {{independence}} from British rule {{and their own}} government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland from British rule {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Irish Constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>Indians</b> <b>who</b> {{joined the}} {{missions}} {{were looking for}} protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities {{in harmony with the}} paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.|$|E

5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years ago, as the {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion of}} the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied prisoners {{who were being}} {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him to}} the fort. Along the way they encountered other <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E

It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some <b>Indians</b> <b>who</b> might trouble us.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to volunteers, Jefferson also {{arranged for a}} regiment of 200 regular Continental soldiers under Colonel John Gibson to accompany Clark. Longstanding tensions between Continental Army officers and the militia made such cooperation problematic, however. Colonel Daniel Brodhead, the Continental Army commander at Fort Pitt, refused to detach men for Clark's campaign because he was staging his own expedition against the Delaware <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> had recently entered {{the war against the}} Americans. Brodhead marched into the Ohio Country and destroyed the Delaware Indian capital of Coshocton in April 1781. This resulted in the Delaware becoming more determined enemies, and deprived Clark of badly needed men and supplies for the Detroit campaign.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1980, McLaughlin {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Twins in {{exchange}} for Willie Norwood. McLaughlin played with the Twins during spring training in 1981. However, on March 31, Minnesota released him. In the 1981 and 1982 seasons, McLaughlin played in the Mexican League. He moved his primary residence to Hermosillo during his two-year stint in Mexico. In August 1982, he joined the Spokane <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> were Triple-A affiliates of the California Angels at the time. With the Indians that season, McLaughlin went 1–0 with a 1.26 ERA, and nine strikeouts in six games, one of which was a start.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} {{manufacturing in}} its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the <b>Indians,</b> <b>who</b> remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh <b>Indians</b> <b>who</b> supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} Burgoyne's {{campaign}} was significant. Not only had he lost nearly 1,000 men, of which half were regulars, {{but he also}} lost the crucial Indian support. In a council following the battle, many of the <b>Indians</b> (<b>who</b> had traveled with him from Quebec) decided to go home. This loss severely hampered Burgoyne's reconnaissance efforts {{in the days to}} come. The failure to bring in nearby supplies meant that he had to rely on supply lines that were already dangerously long, and that he eventually broke in September. The shortage of supplies was a significant factor in his decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.|$|E
