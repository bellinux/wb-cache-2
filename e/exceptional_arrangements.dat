40|$|The holonomic rank of the A-hypergeometric system M_A(β) is {{the degree}} of the toric ideal I_A for generic parameters; in general, {{this is only a}} lower bound.

40|$|Although {{the widely}} shared “ 9 + 2 ” {{structure}} of axonemes {{is thought to}} be highly symmetrical, axonemes show asymmetrical bending during planar and conical motion. In this study, using electron cryotomography and single particle averaging, we demonstrate an asymmetrical molecular arrangement of proteins binding to the nine microtubule doublets in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella. The eight inner arm dynein heavy chains regulate and determine flagellar waveform. Among these, one heavy chain (dynein c) is missing on one microtubule doublet (this doublet also lacks the outer dynein arm), and another dynein heavy chain (dynein b or g) is missing on the adjacent doublet. Some dynein heavy chains either show an abnormal conformation or were replaced by other proteins, possibly minor dyneins. In addition to nexin, there are two additional linkages between specific pairs of doublets.

Laos' military organization and tactical training reflected the French military tradition. Most of the equipment possessed by the Lao military was of United States (US) origin, because the US had been supplying the French during the early phase of the First Indochina War. Matériel support ranged from guns to aircraft. In the post-war period, a small US legation remained in Vientiane and informed Washington {{about the status of}} the Royal Lao Army. The Americans became seriously concerned over the capacity of the Laotians to maintain their equipment, with the majority of items being subject to damage from the tropical sun and rain. As France was no longer responsible for Laos' finances, further concern emerged over payment of the Royal Lao Army salaries.|$|R
40|$|For a long time, HR {{practices}} have been {{assumed to be}} standardized within a company or across {{a large group of}} employees such that all employees are allocated the same resources (e. g. money, goods, training, and information) through the same practices (Kinnie et al., 2005; Wright &Boswell, 2002). Recently, however, arguments are being raised in favor of HR differentiation, rather than HR standardization. HR differentiation refers to "Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi" lang="EN-US">allocating resources  and thus implementing HR practices  differently between groups of employees or between individual employees, e. g. based on performance or needs. Yet, research on the impact of HR differentiation is scarce and focuses nearly exclusively on its strategic value for the organization (e. g. in terms of increasing ROI and organizational performance). As a consequence, the social psychological impact of HR differentiation on individual employees is generally overlooked. This dissertation focuses on unraveling how HR differentiation affects employee perceptions of HR and subsequently their attitudes and behavior. We firstly argued that HR differentiation can signal employees that their individuality (e. g. their individual talents, interests and expectations) is taken into account. As such, HR differentiation can give rise to perceptions of individualization of HR practices among employees which can give rise to positive attitudes and behaviors. This line of thought was subsequently tested in the first empirical study using self-determination theory. Our results showed that when employees perceive their individual talents, interests and expectations to be taken into account, their autonomy and relatedness satisfaction are fostered which subsequently generates favorable outcomes (e. g. higher affective organizational commitment and work engagement and lower turnover intention). Moreover, we found that thisperceived degree of individualization generally has a stronger impact on autonomy and relatedness satisfaction and subsequently outcomes than the mere presence of an HR practice. Secondly, we addressed an issue which can give rise to negative outcomes, i. e. social comparison. From social comparison research, we know that employees tend to compare their outcomes with others to assess the favorability of their outcomes (Greenberg et al., 2007). As HR differentiation creates differences between employees in the outcomes they receive from HR practices (e. g. money, training, information), this social comparison can expose these differences leading to perceptions of favorability concerning HR practice outcomes. More specifically, this can lead some employees to perceive that they are relatively favorably treated by the organization compared totheir colleagues, while others may feel relatively unfavorably treated. This line of reasoning was tested {{in the second and third}} empirical study. In the second study, we focused on investigating whether the perceived favorability of HR practice outcomes influences affective organizational commitment. We found that the perceived favorability ofHR practice outcomes is positively associated with affective organizational commitment but the relationship is attenuated at positive levels. font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi" lang="EN-US">Thus, differentiation may be a double-edged sword as the losses among employees feeling set back may temper, neutralize or even outweigh the benefits among those feeling advantaged. The relationships found were especially salient for workpractices (e. g. autonomy) compared to economic practices (e. g. bonuses). Developmental practices were found to be least suited for differentiation across employees. font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi" lang="EN-US">In the third study, we focused on the impact of perceptions of unfavorability on distributive justice and subsequent behavioral reactions. We did so in a context of i-deals, i. e. <b>exceptional</b> <b>arrangements</b> negotiated by an employee (i. e. the i-dealer) with his or her employer thatbenefit both parties (Rousseau, 2005). I-deals lead to a situation in which co-workers perceive the i-dealer to have an arrangement or working condition which they do not have, i. e. perceived unfavorability. We found that perceptions of distributive injustice of an i-deal generate behavioral reactions among co-workers which can render an i-deal ineffective (e. g. voice and withholding effort). In addition, financial i-deals werefound to be perceived less distributively fair than flexibility i-dealsand workload reduction i-deals. Finally, i-deals were perceived less distributively fair when co-workers are dependent on the i-dealer in theexecution of their work. In conclusion, we aimed to unravel the impact of HR differentiation, taking into account both the positive impact HR differentiation can have on employees as well as potential downsides because of social comparison and justice issues. In the empirical part of the dissertation, we confirmed that HR differentiation can affect individual employees positively when it leaves them with the perception that their individuality is taken into account. However, we also confirmed that HR differentiation is not unequivocally beneficial as it can create a group of employees who feel relatively unfavorably treated in comparison to their colleagues. This can lead to reduced affective organizational commitment and even counterproductive behavior such as withholding effort. As such, we provided the strategic HRM literature on HR differentiation with both a theoretical and empirical critical perspective, refining the current literature that mainly stresses the strategic benefits of HR differentiation. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  status: publishe...|$|E

These results hold for generalized A-hypergeometric systems as well, where SA is replaced by a nontrivial weakly toric module M ⊆ C[ZA].

Military organization and tactical training reflected French traditions. Most of the equipment was of U.S. origin, however, because early in the First Indochina War, the Americans had been supplying the French with matériel ranging from guns to aircraft. Between 1962 and 1971, the U.S. provided Laos with direct military assistance, but not including the cost of equipping and training irregular and paramilitary forces by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). By the time the PEO changed into the Requirements Office in September 1962, the PEO believed [...] "...the Laotian army continued to distinguish itself primarily by its lassitude and incompetence." [...] PEO also noted that CIA-trained Hmong guerrillas were the only troops fighting to preserve northeastern Laos. When the PEO brought in Operation White Star trainers, the instructors found that 19 out of 20 Laotian soldiers had fewer than three years of education.|$|R
40|$|EspR is a {{transcriptional}} regulator that activates the ESX- 1 secretion system during Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{infection and}} {{is critical for}} pathogenesis. It is unique among DNA-binding proteins as it is secreted {{as part of a}} feedback regulatory loop that serves to mitigate transcriptional activity. Here we report the crystal structure of a functional EspR dimer at 2. 5 -Å resolution. The amino-terminal half of EspR is a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain and the carboxy terminus consists of a dimerization domain with similarity to the SinR:SinI sporulation regulator of Bacillus subtilis. Surprisingly, the HTH domains of EspR are arranged in an unusual conformation in which they are splayed at an oblique angle to each other, suggesting that EspR binds DNA in a profoundly different way than most other known HTH regulators. By mapping the EspR binding sites in the espACD promoter, using both in vivo and in vitro binding assays, we show that the EspR operators are located unusually far from the promoter. The EspR dimer binds to these sites cooperatively, but the two “half-sites” contacted by each DNA recognition motif are separated by 177 base pairs. The distinctive structure of EspR and the <b>exceptional</b> <b>arrangement</b> of its operator contacts suggest that it could promote DNA looping in its target promoter. We hypothesize that direct DNA looping mediated by single-site binding of each EspR monomer may facilitate transcriptional control of this important virulence system...|$|R

The states that were allied against France (Prussia, Austria and Russia), reconquered the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank in 1814. After a two-year transitional period, Obereisenbach passed to the Kingdom of Bavaria in a departure from what was generally considered the new border arrangements, with the Glan downstream {{from the mouth of the}} Steinalb generally being held to be the border between Bavaria and Prussia (or until 1834 the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Principality of Lichtenberg). This <b>exceptional</b> <b>arrangement,</b> which also affected Sankt Julian and Eschenau, was part of an exchange against a village in the Oster valley. Sankt Julian at ﬁrst became the seat of a Bürgermeisterei (“mayoralty”) together with Eschenau and Obereisenbach. The merged municipality was called Sankt Julian-Obereisenbach. The mayoralty was united with the one in Ulmet in 1861, but became separate again in 1887. Just after the Second World War, there was an armed confrontation with some French occupational troops, who had been mistaken by the populace for “plundering Russians” who had been forced labourers, now freed, in the only just ended time of the Third Reich. The shooting killed one inhabitant from Obereisenbach. In 1958, a watermain was built in the village. In the course of administrative restructuring in 1968, the Bürgermeisterei of Sankt Julian was dissolved, and in 1972, within the Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken, Sankt Julian became the hub of the like-named Ortsgemeinde with the constituent communities (Ortsteile) of Eschenau, Gumbsweiler, Obereisenbach and Sankt Julian.|$|R

In the course of the 1968 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, the mayoralty was dissolved and the villages of Sankt Julian-Obereisenbach, Eschenau and Gumbsweiler were amalgamated to form the greater municipality of Sankt Julian, which since 1972 has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken.|$|R
