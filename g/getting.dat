40|$|<b>Get</b> 3, <b>Get</b> 4, and <b>Get</b> 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{participate}} in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We elucidated the interaction between <b>Get</b> 4 and <b>Get</b> 5 and investigated their interaction with <b>Get</b> 3 and a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, Sgt 2. Based on co-immunoprecipitation and crystallographic studies, <b>Get</b> 4 and <b>Get</b> 5 formed a tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In contrast, although <b>Get</b> 3 interacted physically with the <b>Get</b> 4 -Get 5 complex, low amounts of <b>Get</b> 3 co-precipitated with <b>Get</b> 5, implying a transient interaction between <b>Get</b> 3 and <b>Get</b> 4 -Get 5.
