The class CC is the complexity class of problems many-one logspace reducible to the <b>Comparator</b> <b>Circuit</b> Value Problem {{and we know that}} NL is contained in CC which is inturn contained in P. Cook, Filmus and Le (2012) showed that CC is also the class of languages decided by polynomial size <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits.</b> We study generalizations of the <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> model that work over fixed finite bounded posets. We observe that there are universal <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> even over arbitrary fixed finite bounded posets. Building on this, we show that general (resp. skew) <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> of polynomial size over fixed finite distributive lattices characterizes CC (resp. L). Complementing this, we show that general <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> of polynomial size over arbitrary fixed finite lattices exactly characterizes P even when the <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> is skew. In addition, we show a characterization of the class NP by a family of polynomial sized <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> over fixed finite bounded posets. These results generalize the results by Cook, Filmus and Le (2012) regarding the power of <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits.</b> As an aside, we consider generalizations of Boolean formulae over arbitrary lattices. We show that Spira's theorem (1971) can be extended to this setting as well and show that polynomial sized Boolean formulae over finite fixed lattices capture exactly NC^ 1.

The algorithm of computer formulation and solving of equations of transfer functions of <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> is provided. Theoretical sub-stantiation of optimizing the micro-layout of large-scale integration circuits of parallel subnanosec-ond analog-to-digital converters (ADC) is proposed. The signal modeling and investigation of transitional processes in <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> of the sub-nanosecond range 6 -, 8 -bit ADC of different layouts are presented.

40|$|In 1990 Subramanian {{defined the}} {{complexity}} class CC as {{the set of}} problems log-space reducible to the <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> value problem (CCV). He and Mayr showed that NL ⊆ CC ⊆ P, and proved {{that in addition to}} CCV several other problems are complete for CC, including the stable marriage problem, and finding the lexicographically first maximal matching in a bipartite graph. We are interested in CC because we conjecture that it is incomparable with the parallel class NC which also satisfies NL ⊆ NC ⊆ P, and note that this conjecture implies that none of the CC-complete problems has an efficient polylog time parallel algorithm. We provide evidence for our conjecture by giving oracle settings in which relativized CC and relativized NC are incomparable. We give several alternative definitions of CC, including (among others) the class of problems computed by uniform polynomial-size families of <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits</b> supplied with copies of the input and its negation, the class of problems AC^ 0 -reducible to CCV, and the class of problems computed by uniform AC^ 0 circuits with CCV gates. We also give a machine model for CC, which corresponds to its characterization as log-space uniform polynomial-size families of <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits.</b> These various characterizations show that CC is a robust class. The main technical tool we employ is universal <b>comparator</b> <b>circuits.</b> Other results include a simpler proof of NL ⊆ CC, and an explanation of the relation between the Gale-Shapley algorithm and Subramanian's algorithm for stable marriage.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} clock gating {{technique}} {{along with a}} <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> is presented for low power VLSI (very large scale integration) circuit design. The rapid {{increase in the number}} of transistors on chips enabled a dramatic increase in the performance of computing systems. However, the performance improvement has been accompanied by an increase in power dissipation; thus requiring more expensive packaging and cooling technology. Reducing power dissipation is one of the most principle subjects in VLSI design today. Clock gating is a technique to reduce clock power with the help of transmission gate. In this paper 3 bit JK flip flop is designed using transmission gate. 3 bit JK flip-flop is constructed by connecting three JK flip-flops in series i. e. output of first JK flip-flop is fed as input of second JK flip-flop and the output of second JK flip-flop is fed as input of third JK flip-flop.
