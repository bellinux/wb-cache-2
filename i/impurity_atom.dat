We find that the <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> get localized and can form pairs when {{the interaction between the}} <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> and the LO superfluid is strong enough. These features are due to the phenomena of self-localization whose underlying mechanism is revealed by an effective model.

50|$|Short {{wavelength}} phonons {{are strongly}} scattered by impurity atoms if an alloyed phase is present, but mid and long wavelength phonons are less affected. Mid and long wavelength phonons carry significant fraction of heat, so to further reduce lattice thermal conductivity {{one has to}} introduce structures to scatter these phonons. This is achieved by introducing interface scattering mechanism, which requires structures whose characteristic length is longer than that of <b>impurity</b> <b>atom.</b> Some possible ways to realize these interfaces are nanocomposites and embedded nanoparticles/structures.|$|E
50|$|Impurities play an {{important}} role in the nucleation of other phase transitions. For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys. Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned Kondo effect where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the <b>impurity</b> <b>atom.</b> Magnetic impurities in superconductors can serve as generation sites for vortex defects. Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in ferromagnets and dramatically affect their coercivity. In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for phase transitions because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size domain of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.|$|E

50|$|The major {{criterion}} for absorber foils used in ERDA {{is whether a}} recoiling <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> can be transmitted through the absorber, preferably a commercially available metal foil, while stopping heavy particles. Since the lighter atoms leave the absorber with smaller energies, the kinematic calculations do not provide much help. Favorable results have been obtained by using heavier ion beams of approximately 1 MeV/ nucleon. The best overall candidate is the 35Cl ion beam; although, 79Br would give better sensitivity by one order of magnitude compared to the 35Cl ion beam. The mass resolution, of the detector at θ= 0°, of thin samples is ΔM/Δx ~ 0.3 amu/1000 Angstroms of the profile width. With thick samples, the mass resolution is feasible at θ≤30°. In thicker samples there is some degradation of mass resolution and slight loss of sensitivity. The detector solid angle has to be closed, but the thick sample can take more current without heating, which decreases sample degradation.|$|E

The distortion of local lattice around the <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> was evaluated from the Si-X bond length determined by extended x-ray absorption fine structure. The results demonstrate that the local lattice deformation {{is strongly dependent on}} the electronic configuration of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms,</b> i. e., we find an anomalous expansion (0. 09 +/- 0. 01 Angstrom) along the [111] direction for donor (As) atoms but much smaller magnitude (0. 03 +/- 0. 01 Angstrom) for isovalent (Ge) atoms and acceptor (Ga) atoms. The results suggest that the local lattice distortions are strongly affected by the Coulomb interactions between the localized charge, which piles up to screen the ion core and the bond charge, and the ion-core repulsion. Absence of anomaly in case of negatively charged Ga atoms suggests that the former mechanism is a dominant factor for anomalous lattice expansion...|$|R

50|$|Segregation to free {{surfaces}} {{also has}} important consequences involving {{the purity of}} metallurgical samples. Because of the favorable segregation of some impurities {{to the surface of}} the material, a very small concentration of impurity in the bulk of the sample can lead to a very significant coverage of the impurity on a cleaved surface of the sample. In applications where an ultra-pure surface is needed (for example, in some nanotechnology applications), the segregation of impurities to surfaces requires a much higher purity of bulk material than would be needed if segregation effects didn’t exist. The following figure illustrates this concept with two cases in which the total fraction of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> is 0.25 (25 <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> in 100 total). In the representation on the left, these impurities are equally distributed throughout the sample, and so the fractional surface coverage of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> is also approximately 0.25. In the representation to the right, however, the same number of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> are shown segregated on the surface, so that an observation of the surface composition would yield a much higher impurity fraction (in this case, about 0.69). In fact, in this example, were impurities to completely segregate to the surface, an impurity fraction of just 0.36 could completely cover the surface of the material. In an application where surface interactions are important, this result could be disastrous.|$|R

40|$|The Kondo {{effect in}} condensed-matter systems manifests itself most sharply in their {{transport}} measurements. Here we propose an analogous transport {{signature of the}} orbital Kondo effect realized with ultracold atoms. Our system consists of imbalanced Fermi seas of two components of fermions and an <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> of different species which is confined by an isotropic potential. We first apply a π/ 2 pulse to transform two components of fermions into two superposition states. Their interactions with the <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> then cause a "transport" of fermions from majority to minority superposition states, whose numbers can be measured after applying another 3 π/ 2 pulse. In particular, when the interaction of one component of fermions with the <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> is tuned close to a confinement-induced p-wave or higher partial-wave resonance, the resulting conductance is shown to exhibit the Kondo signature, i. e., universal logarithmic growth by lowering the temperature.
