5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon.

5|$|MSFU crews signed ship's {{articles}} as civilian {{crew members}} {{under the authority}} of the civilian ship's master. The ship's chief engineer became responsible for the catapult, and the first mate acted as Catapult Duty Officer (CDO), responsible for <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> catapult when directed. The single Hurricane fighter was launched only when enemy aircraft were sighted and agreement was reached via hand and flag signals between the pilot, CDO, and ship's master.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2012, nine-year {{head coach}} Lovie Smith was fired. After Smith's <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> Bears {{requested}} interviews with thirteen coaches, twelve from the NFL and Montreal Alouettes (of the Canadian Football League) head coach Marc Trestman. The hunt later narrowed down to Trestman, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Indianapolis Colts offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. Ultimately, Trestman was hired on January 15.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E

5000|$|On St Valentine's Day (February 14) of 1988, {{there was}} a major <b>fire</b> in <b>the</b> hotel, which {{resulted}} in the deaths of four guests and two members of staff. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> originated in <b>the</b> Panorama Grill on the 31st floor of the hotel, and was caused by self-ignition while refilling an alcohol-fuelled food heater. The consequences of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> were made worse because <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> disabled <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> lift, forcing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> brigade to hand carry all their equipment up to the seat of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> restaurant was replaced with meeting and event rooms. In 2011, the restaurants Szenario und Dialog and the Edison Bar closed down after more than 20 years of operation. After a three-month renovation period, the new Le Muh restaurant opened.

5|$|When <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 had {{a slight}} {{advantage}} over the 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45cal gun would be slower, meaning {{that it would have}} a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2degrees, as opposed to 36degrees with the 50cal.|$|E
5|$|Although immobilizing {{a victim}} {{in front of}} a gun before <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the victim was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|Brand and Bond are imprisoned {{where the}} blast from the Moonraker's engines will incinerate them, to leave {{no trace of}} them once the Moonraker is launched. Before the <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> couple escape. Brand gives Bond the proper {{coordinates}} to redirect the gyros and send the Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Russian submarine—only to be killed as the vessel flees through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.|$|E
5|$|By 22 May Léopard was {{reassigned to}} the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry {{demolition}} teams to the northernmost French ports; the ship arrived at Boulogne-sur-Mer that evening. Together with Chacal and eight smaller destroyers, Léopard bombarded advancing German troops {{as they approached}} the defenses of Boulogne-sur-Mer, <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> last shots of the battle at midday on 24 May. On 28 May, a special flotilla was constituted under the command of Admiral Marcel Landriau, with his flag on the aviso , with these ships and a number of smaller units to support the ongoing evacuation of Dunkirk. On 3 June, the contre-torpilleur rescued 19 British soldiers from a boat and delivered them to England.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a multiple rocket launcher for the RS-132 aircraft rocket (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, {{the result was the}} BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E

5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
5|$|Variants of {{the flame}} fougasse {{included}} the demigasse, a barrel on its side and left in the open with explosive buried underneath; and the hedge hopper: a barrel on end with explosive buried underneath a few inches deep and slightly off centre. On <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> hedge hopper barrel was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|On October 24, 2006, scrap dealers were {{cutting up}} a boiler in the {{basement}} for salvage with acetylene torches that sparked a large <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> was allowed {{to get out of}} control and gutted the building.
