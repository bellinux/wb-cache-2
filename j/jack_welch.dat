40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to in a succinct manner provide a clear {{delineation}} of key factors and primary points for increasing the likelihood of success and upward mobility in corporate America. Numerous facets of the personal and professional lives of corporate executives have been documented, studied, and debated. From the autobiographies of successful individuals such as <b>Jack</b> <b>Welch’s</b> “Winning” to analysis of the widely criticized executives, such as Home Depot’s former CEO Bob Nardelli, the lives of these high ranking corporate managers have been extensively scrutinized. However, despite the numerous studies, and with the study of any behavioral science holding the potential to return an innumerable amount of outcomes, it is obvious that portions of this field lend themselves to further analysis. Since the beginning of my working career, my interest has always centered on upper level management. From wondering how much the store manager at my first job got paid, to pondering the strategic moves of today’s Fortune 500 CEOs, my focus has been on the people driving organizations. Coupling this with my goal to one day attain an executive position, my recent curiosity has turned to how to best position myself to be considered for an executive level management position in the future. To do so, the most effective means appeared to be to interview senior level managers and executives within local companies and see what their experience and success has taught them and more importantly, what information they can pass on to a individual looking to one day earn a similar position...|$|R

2500|$|His time in Britain had damaged Welsh's {{credibility}} in America, so {{he set out}} to make amends. An easy victory over Pal Moore in March was followed by a trip to California to face Matty Baldwin in San Francisco. Welsh won the Baldwin fight on points, and was considered an excellent display of boxing. On 4 August 1911, after weeks of negotiation, it was announced that Wolgast would face Welsh on 30 November, Welsh's first attempt at the world title. The buildup was intense and both camps attempted to use the media to their advantage. Just days before the match, with tickets in high demand, the man named in the fight articles as the referee, Eddie Smith, died. This led to arguments between Welsh and Tom 'Ten per cent' Jones, Wolgast's manager, as both tried to get the most favourable replacement referee. When Jones and Welsh met each other by chance on Windward Avenue in Venice, California, the men came to a heated argument with Jones threatening that he would 'knock his [...] block off'. A few days later, realising that he was the challenger, Welsh accepted Jones' choice of referee, <b>Jack</b> <b>Welch.</b> On the eve of the big encounter, news reached Welsh that Wolgast had been taken to hospital with acute appendicitis and would be unable to fight for three months. Walgast's last-minute replacement Willie Ritchie took Welsh the full twenty rounds, and although he failed to beat the Welshman, the fight had many fans contemplating how Welsh would have fared against the champion.|$|E

The controlling factor is what the authors call [...] "outrage"—"the criticism of outsiders whose views matter most to executives — institutional investors, business media, and the social and professional groups to which directors and managers belong" [...] and the executives' fear that going too far will [...] "create a backlash from usually quiescent shareholders, workers, politicians, or the general public."
