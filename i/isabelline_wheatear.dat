50|$|In the {{breeding}} season the <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> {{is found in}} open country, barren tracts of land, arid regions, steppes, high plateaux and on the lower slopes of hills. In its winter quarters it occupies similar habitats in semi-arid regions, open country with sparse scrub and the borders of cultivated areas, showing a particular liking for sandy ground.|$|E
50|$|The <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> is a {{migratory species}} with an eastern palearctic {{breeding}} range. This extends from Southern Russia, the Caspian region, the Kyzyl Kum Desert and Mongolia to Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Israel. It winters in Africa and northwestern India. It has occurred {{as a summer}} vagrant to Greece, Cyprus, Algeria and Tunisia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> has an {{extensive}} range, estimated as being 11.7 million square kilometres (4.36 million square miles), {{and a large}} population with an estimated total of 26 million to 378 million individuals. The population seems to be stable and the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species has evaluated this species as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|Besides the Balkanic and sub-Mediterranean forests, the Măcin Mountains {{also have}} a {{considerable}} swathe of steppe, making it a delightful site for birds. The area is a staging point for various migratory bird species, especially raptors, who arrive here in autumn. The region is home to species such as European turtle dove, red-rumped swallow, common and <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatears,</b> ortolan bunting and several others. Măcin Mountains are also the hunting grounds of the long-legged buzzard (Buteo rufinus), one of Europe's largest buzzards. It shares the mountains with other birds of prey such as short-toed eagle, booted eagle, Levant sparrowhawk and saker falcon.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} located at {{semi-desert}} zone in the valley of Vedi River. There are about 15 pairs of White Storks breeding right in the village. Vicinity of the village have 131 species of butterflies and are recognized as Prime Butterfly Area. Also number of bird species are recorded inside the village (e.g. Syrian Woodpecker, Levant Sparrowhawk, etc.) and its outskirts (e.g. Lanner Falcon, Grey-headed Bunting, <b>Isabelline</b> <b>Wheatear,</b> and others).|$|E
50|$|The <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe isabellina) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member of}} the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher in the family Muscicapidae. It is a migratory insectivorous bird. Its habitat is steppe and open countryside and it breeds in southern Russia and central Asia to northern Pakistan, wintering in Africa and northwestern India. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> is {{an active}} and restless bird, moving across the ground with long hops, flitting {{into the air and}} {{perching}} on eminences or small bushes. Its posture is rather upright and it is constantly bobbing about and flaring, raising and lowering its tail. It sometimes flutters into the air to catch insect prey but mostly forages along the ground, probing the soil with its beak. Its diet includes ants, grasshoppers, moths, flies, mites, spiders and insect larvae, and it sometimes eats seeds as well.|$|E
50|$|The term {{is found}} in {{reference}} to plumage colouring in the bird species names isabelline bush-hen, <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear,</b> and isabelline shrike, {{as well as in}} descriptions of birds. The genetic pigmentation disorder isabellinism seen in birds is derived from the colour word and is a form of leucism caused by a uniform reduction in the production and expression of melanin resulting in areas of plumage {{on the back of the}} bird, normally black, being strongly faded, or isabelline, in appearance. Isabellinism has been reported in several species of penguin.|$|E
50|$|The Afghan snowfinch builds nests in the burrows and hollows made by rodents, {{including}} ground squirrels, marmots, {{and in one}} recorded case Williams' jerboa (Allactaga williamsi). In particular, it {{is associated}} with the yellow ground squirrel (Spermophilus fulvus). Several of the other southern snowfinch species have similar nesting preferences, as does at least one species that occurs in the Afghan snowfinch's range, the <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear.</b> The materials used to line the burrows it nests in are the hairs of squirrels, sheep, and dromedaries; and feathers. Nests are built {{at the far end of}} the burrows, as protection from predators. The young hatch blind and helpless, with exposed pink skin and only a few, light-coloured tufts of down. Young give a soft call in response to adults calling at the entrance of a nest.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> {{are similar in}} appearance. The upper-parts are a pale sandy brown with an isabelline tinge (isabelline is a pale grey-yellow, fawn, cream-brown or {{parchment}} colour). The lower back is isabelline and the rump and upper tail-coverts are white. The tail feathers are brownish-black with a narrow edge and tip of buff and a large white base. In the outer tail feathers this occupies {{more than half the}} length of the feather but in the central feathers it is about one third. There is an over-eye streak of creamy white and the ear-coverts are pale brown. The chin is pale cream and the throat pale buff. The breast is sandy or isabelline buff and the belly creamy white. The under tail-coverts are pale buff and the under wing-coverts and axilliaries white with dark bases. The wing feathers are brownish-black, tipped and edged with creamy buff. The beak, legs and feet are black and the irises are brown.|$|E
50|$|Habitats of {{the park}} range from maquis on the lower slopes, through {{deciduous}} woodland and beech and fir forest to alpine meadows at the highest levels. It is a refuge for mountain birds, such as lammergeier and other vultures, golden eagle and more than 20 other raptor species. Other high-altitude species include alpine accentor, rock thrushes and choughs. The area is also good for eastern specialities such as <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear,</b> and, at almost the most westerly points of their range, red-fronted serin and Krüper's nuthatch. The dense fir forest holds short-toed treecreeper, common crossbill and Tengmalm's owl, a rare and very local bird in Turkey, {{as well as the}} white-backed woodpecker. The rare and local butterfly, Parnassius apollo graslini, is found on Uludag and the area has much of interest to botanists, with colourful pink primroses (Primula vulgaris var. sibthorpii), leopard's bane (Doronicum orientale), crocuses: the purple Crocus siberi and yellow Crocus flavus, and grape hyacinths (Muscari racemosum). There are also few wolf packs roaming on the mountain.|$|E
50|$|Isabelline wheatears are solitary {{birds in}} their winter {{quarters}} and may associate with other Oenanthe species during migration. On arrival at their breeding grounds they establish territories. The male <b>isabelline</b> <b>wheatear</b> displays {{to the female}} by drooping and then spreading his wings while singing, leaping a short distance in the air, or flying up fifteen metres (fifty feet) or so, hovering and performing stunts, singing all the while, before landing again beside the female. The nest is usually underground, normally in the empty burrow of a pika, ground squirrel or mole rat, or they may excavate a fresh burrow. The nest is bulky and is composed of dried grasses. Four to six pale blue eggs are laid, usually unmarked but sometimes with a scattering of reddish speckles. The average size of the eggs is 22.16 x 16.6 mm. Both parents feed the chicks with small caterpillars and other insects. After they leave the nest, the chicks continue to be fed {{for about two weeks}} but after this the parents drive them out of the territory. The breeding season starts at the end of March in Turkey but does not commence until May in Central Asia. There are probably two broods in the southern parts of the range.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{dealt with the}} {{creation}} of habitat model of <b>Isabelline</b> <b>Wheatear</b> and Northern Wheatear in the south of Altaj. A wheatear is one of the species which is on the decrease and isn't protected in any special way. That's why I put forward a proposal for a model of suitable habitat and a way how to protect it...|$|E

40|$|Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The said {{bird was}} sighted {{perching}} on Phoenix acaulis and had distinctive sandy-brown plumage with pale white supercilium, white rump and black tail with white tips and edges. The bird {{landed on a}} nearby pathway, where it was observed {{for a total of}} c. 15 minutes before it returned to the perch. The bird flew from its perch to an open ground and then returned to the perch. We had an opportunity to observe the bird for about 15 minutes. The bird perched in an upright stance and had long legs. The bird was identified as Desert Wheatear Oenanthe deserti following Kazmierczak, (2000) and Grimmett et al. (1998). The identification was also independently confirmed from the photograph by more experienced members of the Birdwatchers ’ Society of Andhra Pradesh. The senior author (CS) has observed this species and <b>Isabelline</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe isabellina in Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi environs between 2005 and 2007. The bird is presumed to be a non-breeding adult female as its throat is white with pale whitish fringes and has broad whitish to buffish fringes and blackish centre on wing coverts. The present report constitutes recent sighting of this species in Andhra Pradesh. This bird had been purportedly “observed along the route from Nirmal to Utnoor (via Talamdiri village) between 12 and 15 [1925]”, Adilabad district by the late Dr. Salim Ali (Al...|$|E
