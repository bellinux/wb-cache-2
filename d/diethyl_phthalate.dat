50|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> or o-Benzenedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester {{consists}} of a benzene ring with two carboxylic acid ethyl esters attached {{to it in the}} ortho (1,2) pattern. It is a highly conjugated system, as the pi-cloud on the benzene ring, the p-orbitals on the carbonyl atoms and the lone pairs on the oxygens are all conjugated. The substituents are meta-directing, and they are ortho to each other, so all positions in the ring are more or less equally deactivated. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> is likely to undergo biodegradation in the environment.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of phthalate esters (PAEs) in Chinese hospitals were investigated by simultaneously determining {{concentrations of}} gas- and particle-phase PAEs. PAEs were detected in two third-class first-grade hospitals, two second-class first-grade hospitals, {{and a community}} health service center. Hospital drugstores had the highest concentration (24. 19 mu g/m(3)), which was 1. 54 times that of newly decorated houses. The second highest concentration {{was found in the}} transfusion rooms, averaging 21. 89 mu g/m(3); this was followed by the concentrations of PAEs in the nurse&# 39;s workstations, the wards, and the doctor&# 39;s offices, with mean concentrations of 20. 66, 20. 0, and 16. 92 mu g/m(3), respectively. The lowest concentrations were found in the hallways (16. 30 mu g/m(3)). Of the six different kinds of PAEs found, major pollutants included <b>diethyl</b> <b>phthalates,</b> dibutyl phthalates, butylbenzyl phthalates and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalates, comprising more than 80 % of all PAEs present. Meanwhile, a comparison between different wards showed that PAE concentrations in the maternity wards were 1. 63 times higher than in the main wards. Based on known health hazards, our results suggest that the PAEs seriously influence the health of the pregnant women and babies; therefore, it is of great importance to take the phthalate concentrations in hospitals into consideration. In addition, hospital indoor air was more seriously contaminated than the air of newly decorated houses. (C) 2015 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

40|$|International audiencePhthalates are {{synthetic}} contaminants {{released into}} the environment notably by plastic waste. Semi- volatile, they adsorb to atmospheric particles and get distributed in all ecosystems. Effects of this major anthropogenic pollution in economical species in aquatic habitats have attracted large interest. On the contrary, very few {{studies have focused on}} wild terrestrial species. Yet, these lipophilic molecules are easily trapped by insect cuticle; ants and other insects have been shown to permanently bear among their cuticular components a non-negligible proportion of phthalates, meaning that they suffer from chronic exposure to these pollutants. Oral route could also be an additional way of contamination, as phthalates tend to stick to any organic particle. We show here via a food choice experiment that Lasius niger workers can detect, and avoid feeding on, food contaminated with DEHP (<b>DiEthyl</b> Hexyl <b>Phthalate),</b> the most widespread phthalate found in nature. This suggests that the main source of contamination for ants is atmosphere and that doses measured on the cuticle correspond to the chronic exposure levels for these animals. Such an ecologically relevant dose of DEHP was used to contaminate ants in lab and to investigate their physiological impact. Over a chronic exposure (1 dose per week for 5 weeks), the egg- laying rate of queens was signi␣cantly reduced lending credence to endocrine disruptive properties of such a pollutant, as also described for aquatic invertebrates. On the contrary, short term exposure (24 h) to a single dose of DEHP does not induce oxidative stress in ant workers as expected, but leads to activation of the immune system. Because of their very large distribution, their presence in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and their representation at all trophic levels, ants could be useful indicators of contamination by phthalates, especially via monitoring the level of activation of their immune state...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{analyzed}} the {{trends in the}} body-weight-adjusted urinary monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations and the <b>diethyl</b> ethyl <b>phthalate</b> (DEP) daily intake estimates in the general Canadian population (aged 6 - 49 years) using the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007 – 2009 dataset. The creatinine correction approach, {{as well as the}} urine volume approach in a simple one compartment model were used to calculate the daily urinary MEP excretion rates and DEP intake rates in individual survey participants. Using multiple regression models, we have estimated least square geometric means (LSGMs) of body-weight-adjusted MEP concentration, daily excretion and intake rates among different age groups and sex. We observed that body weight affects the trends in the MEP concentrations significantly among children (aged 6 – 11 years), adolescents (aged 12 – 19 years) and adults (aged 20 – 49 years). The body-weight-adjusted MEP concentrations in children were significantly higher than those in adults. On the other hand the DEP daily intakes in children were significantly lower than those in adults. We did not observe any differences in the DEP daily intake rates between males and females. Although the urinary MEP concentrations are correlated well with DEP daily intake estimates in the overall population, one should be cautious when directly using the urinary concentrations to compare the intake trends in the sub-populations (e. g. children vs. adults) as these trends are governed by additional physiological factors. The DEP daily intake calculated using the creatinine approach and that using the urine volume approach were similar to each other. The estimated geometric mean and 95 th percentile of DEP daily intake in the general Canadian population are 2 and 20 μg/kg-bw/day, respectively.

40|$|Experimental {{determinations}} of {{the dynamics}} of photoinduced electron transfer from rubrene to duroquinone in three solvents, dibutyl <b>phthalate,</b> <b>diethyl</b> sebacate, and cyclohexanone are presented. Measurements of the donor (rubrene) fluorescence decays were made with time-correlated single-photon counting. The data are analyzed using recent theoretical developments that include important features of the solvent, i. e., the effects of finite molecular volume on local solvent structure and on the mutual donor-acceptor diffusion rates. Inclusion of the liquid radial distribution function (rdf) in the theory accounts for the significant variation of the acceptor concentration near a donor. Because the concentration of acceptors near a donor is substantially greater than the average concentration used in a featureless continuum liquid model, incorporating the rdf is necessary to properly analyze experimental data. Hydrodynamic effects, which slow the rate of donoracceptor approach at short distance, are important and are also included in the theoretical analysis of the data. The data analysis depends on a reasonable model of the rdf. A hard-sphere liquid rdf is shown to be sufficiently accurate by comparing model electron-transfer calculations using a hard-sphere rdf and an rdf from neutronscattering experiments reported in the literature. A method is presented to obtain the hard-sphere parameters needed to calculate the rdf. The method uses a self-consistent determination of the hard-sphere radius and diffusion constant and the solvent self-diffusion constant calculated from the Spernol and Wirtz equation...|$|R

This work presents {{the first comprehensive}} study of the detection of the volatile and semi-volatile additives of smokeless powders using solid phase microextraction (SPME) as a sampling and pre-concentration technique. Seventy smokeless powders were studied using laboratory based chromatography techniques and a field deployable ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). The detection of diphenylamine, ethyl and methyl centralite, 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene, <b>diethyl</b> and dibutyl <b>phthalate</b> by IMS to associate {{the presence of these}} compounds to smokeless powders is also reported for the first time. A previously reported SPME-IMS analytical approach facilitates rapid sub-nanogram detection of the vapor phase components of smokeless powders. A mass calibration procedure for the analytical techniques used in this study was developed. Precise and accurate mass delivery of analytes in picoliter volumes was achieved using a drop-on-demand inkjet printing method. Absolute mass detection limits determined using this method for the various analytes of interest ranged between 0. 03 – 0. 8 ng for the GC-MS and between 0. 03 – 2 ng for the IMS. Mass response graphs generated for different detection techniques help in the determination of mass extracted from the headspace of each smokeless powder. The analyte mass present in the vapor phase was sufficient for a SPME fiber to extract most analytes at amounts above the detection limits of both chromatographic techniques and the ion mobility spectrometer. ^ Analysis of the large number of smokeless powders revealed that diphenylamine was present in the headspace of 96 % of the powders. Ethyl centralite was detected in 47 % of the powders and 8 % of the powders had methyl centralite available for detection from the headspace sampling of the powders by SPME. Nitroglycerin was the dominant peak present in the headspace of the double-based powders. 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene which is another important headspace component was detected in 44 % of the powders. The powders therefore have more than one headspace component and the detection of a combination of these compounds is achievable by SPME-IMS leading to an association to the presence of smokeless powders. ...|$|R

HVAR had a constant 5" [...] diameter for both warhead and rocket motor, increasing propellant from 8.5 to 23.9 lb of Ballistite. U.S. Ballistite propellant had a sea level specific impulse of over 200 seconds, compared with about 180 seconds for the British Cordite, German WASAG and Soviet PTP propellants.

5000|$|Phthalates and BPA {{date back}} to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as insect repellents and cercaricides. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through landfills and sewage treatment plant runoff allowing for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. [...] These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible. It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by. Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted spermatogenesis in fish in the low range. A Phthalate referred to as <b>diethyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to LC50 doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week. Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al. This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with Cyprinus carpio, liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment. Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by. A decrease in immunity of M. rosenbergii after exposure to DEP was also noted. Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.|$|E
