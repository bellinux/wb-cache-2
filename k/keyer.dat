25|$|In the 16th century, wooden {{buildings}} were razed {{and replaced with}} brick ones. During this period, many {{buildings were}} constructed in the architectural style of the Renaissance. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own Renaissance architecture. These buildings were built according {{to the principles of}} the architect Hendrick de Keyser. One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de <b>Keyer</b> is the Westerkerk. In the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam's Golden Age. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were Jacob van Campen, Philips Vingboons and Daniel Stalpaert.|$|E
25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift <b>keyer</b> that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E

50|$|Such keyers, {{often used}} in {{conjunction}} with wearable computers, are typically one-handed grips. Unlike keyboards, the wearable <b>keyer</b> has no board upon which the switches are mounted. Additionally, by providing some other function - such as simultaneous grip of flash light and keying - the <b>keyer</b> is effectively hands-free, in the sense that one would still be holding the light source anyway.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] session <b>key</b> is a {{single-use}} symmetric <b>key</b> {{used for}} encrypting all messages in one communication session. A closely related term is content encryption <b>key</b> (CEK), traffic encryption <b>key</b> (TEK), or multicast <b>key</b> {{which refers to}} any <b>key</b> used to encrypt messages, as opposed to other uses, like encrypting other <b>keys</b> (<b>key</b> encryption <b>key</b> (KEK) or <b>key</b> wrapping <b>key).</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the P/P section, {{there is}} another keying stage called the {{downstream}} <b>keyer</b> (DSK). It is mostly used for keying text or graphics, and has its own [...] "Cut" [...] and [...] "Mix" [...] buttons. The signal before the DSK <b>keyer</b> is called clean feed. After the DSK is one last stage that overrides any signal with black, usually called Fade To Black or FTB.|$|E
50|$|Mode B is {{the second}} mode, which devolved from a logic error in an early iambic <b>keyer.</b> In mode B, dots and dashes are {{produced}} as long as both paddles are depressed. When the paddles are released, the keying continues by sending one more element, i.e., a dot if the paddles were released during a dash, or a dash if the paddles were released during a dot. Users accustomed to one mode usually {{find it difficult to}} use the other, so all competently designed keyers allow for selection of the desired <b>keyer</b> mode. If forced to use a <b>keyer</b> with an unaccustomed mode, the user must revert to single paddle mode in which both paddles are never depressed simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>keyer</b> is {{a device}} for {{signaling}} by hand, {{by way of}} pressing one or more switches. Modern keyers typically have {{a large number of}} switches but not as many as a full-size keyboard; typically between four and fifty. A <b>keyer</b> differs from a keyboard {{in the sense that it}} lacks a traditional [...] "board"; the keys are arranged in a cluster which is often held in the hand. An example of a very simple <b>keyer</b> is a single telegraph key which used for keying Morse code. In such a use, the term [...] "to key" [...] typically means to turn on and off a carrier wave. For example, it is said that one [...] "keys the transmitter" [...] by interrupting some stage of the amplification of a transmitter with a telegraph key.|$|E
50|$|A <b>key</b> {{retainer}} device (KRD) is a {{small metal}} unit that is wall or door mounted, usually designed for the interchangeable core that retains one <b>key</b> (<b>Key</b> A) while the second <b>key</b> (<b>Key</b> B) is used for authorized purposes. When the <b>key</b> in use (<b>Key</b> B) is returned into the <b>key</b> retainer, the <b>key</b> held captive (<b>Key</b> A) is turned and then can be released. Now, the special <b>key,</b> perhaps top master (<b>Key</b> B) is held captive again. The <b>key</b> retainer is a method for providing visual <b>key</b> control.|$|R
2500|$|The Windows logo <b>key</b> (also {{known as}} Windows <b>key,</b> start <b>key,</b> logo <b>key,</b> flag <b>key,</b> super <b>key,</b> command <b>key,</b> flag or home) is a {{keyboard}} <b>key</b> which was originally introduced on the Microsoft Natural keyboard in 1994.

50|$|The islands {{separating}} Sarasota Bay {{from the}} gulf near the city, known as <b>keys,</b> include Lido <b>Key</b> and Siesta <b>Key,</b> which are famous worldwide {{for the quality of}} their sandy beaches. The <b>keys</b> that are included in the boundary of Sarasota are Lido <b>Key,</b> St. Armands <b>Key,</b> Otter <b>Key,</b> Coon <b>Key,</b> Bird <b>Key,</b> and portions of Siesta <b>Key.</b> Previously, Siesta <b>Key</b> was named Sarasota <b>Key.</b> At one time, it and all of Longboat <b>Key</b> were considered part of Sarasota and confusing contemporaneous references may be found discussing them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island is}} {{somewhat}} [...] "U"-shaped, with Upper Sugarloaf Sound and Park <b>Key</b> separating the island into Upper Sugarloaf <b>Key</b> and Lower Sugarloaf <b>Key.</b> So called, upper and lower, simply referencing the relative {{nature of their}} geographic positions, not as distinct islands. Lower Sugarloaf <b>Key</b> is located approximately 13 mi from <b>Key</b> West, between Park <b>Key</b> and Saddlebunch <b>Keys.</b> Upper Sugarloaf <b>Key</b> is located about 15 mi east of <b>Key</b> West, between Park <b>Key</b> and Cudjoe <b>Key.</b> While smaller in land area than Upper Sugarloaf <b>Key,</b> Lower Sugarloaf <b>Key</b> has a greater density of population.|$|R
50|$|Like the bug, the {{electronic}} <b>keyer</b> operates sideways. When pressed {{to one side}} {{the electronic}}s generate a series of dahs and when pressed the other way, a series of dits. Most electronic keyers include a dit memory function which frees the operator from the need to perfectly time his transitions in the sequence dah-dit-dah. With dit memory, if the operator's keying action is about one dit ahead of the actual transmission, the keyer's output for each letter will be machine-perfect. An iambic <b>keyer</b> sports dual paddles, one for dit and one for dah; pressing {{both at the same}} time produces an alternating dit-dah-dit-dah sequence. Electronic keyers allow very high speed transmission of code.|$|E
5000|$|A chorded {{keyboard}} {{minus the}} board, typically {{designed to be}} used while held in the hand, is called a <b>keyer.</b> Douglas Engelbart introduced the chorded keyset as a computer interface in 1968 at what is often called [...] "The Mother of All Demos".|$|E

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{technique used}} in public <b>key</b> cryptography {{is the use}} of asymmetric <b>key</b> algorithms, where a <b>key</b> used by one party to perform encryption {{is not the same as}} the <b>key</b> used by another in decryption. Each user has a pair of cryptographic <b>keys</b> - a public encryption <b>key</b> and a private decryption <b>key.</b> For example, a <b>key</b> pair used for digital signatures consists of a private signing <b>key</b> and a public verification <b>key.</b> The public <b>key</b> may be widely distributed, while the private <b>key</b> is known only to its proprietor. The <b>keys</b> are related mathematically, but the parameters are chosen so that calculating the private <b>key</b> from the public <b>key</b> is unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|Cryptographic <b>keys</b> {{may also}} have <b>keys</b> that {{designate}} {{they can be used}} for long-term (static, archived) use or used for a single session (ephemeral). The latter generally applies to the use of an Ephemeral <b>Key</b> Agreement <b>Key.</b> Most other <b>key</b> types are designed to last for long crypto-periods from about one to two years. When a shorter crypto-period is designed different <b>key</b> types may be used, such as Data Encryption <b>keys,</b> Symmetric Authentication <b>keys,</b> Private Key-Transport <b>keys,</b> Key-Wrapping <b>keys,</b> Authorization <b>keys</b> or RNG <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{keyboards}} {{that lack}} a physical Meta <b>key</b> (or <b>keys),</b> its functionality may be invokable by other <b>keys</b> {{such as the}} Alt <b>key,</b> the Windows <b>key,</b> or user-configured <b>keys.</b> If no Meta <b>key</b> function is available, some software will accept alternate keybindings using, for example, the Esc <b>key</b> as a prefix <b>key</b> (as, for example, in Emacs).|$|R
