40|$|We present $V$-band light {{curves of}} 61 {{variables}} {{from the core}} of the globular cluster M 5 obtained using a newly developed image subtraction method (ISM). Four of these variables were previously unknown. Only 26 variables were found in the same field using photometry obtained with DoPHOT software. Fourier parameters of the ISM light curves have relative errors up to 20 times smaller than parameters measured from DoPHOT photometry. We conclude that the new method is very promising for searching for variable stars in the cores of the globular clusters and gives very accurate relative photometry with quality comparable to photometry obtained by HST. We also show that the variable V 104 is not an <b>eclipsing</b> <b>star</b> as has been suggested, but is an RRc star showing non-radial pulsations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} the unusual <b>eclipsing</b> <b>star</b> OGLE LMC-ECL- 11893 (OGLE J 05172127 - 6900558) in the Large Magellanic Cloud recently reported by Dong et al. 2014. The eclipse period for this star is 468 days, and the eclipses exhibit a minimum of ~ 1. 4 mag, preceded by a plateau of ~ 0. 8 mag. Spectra and optical/IR photometry are consistent with the eclipsed star being a lightly reddened B 9 III star of inferred age ~ 150 Myr and mass of ~ 4 solar masses. The disk appears to have an outer radius of ~ 0. 2 AU with predicted temperatures of ~ 1100 - 1400 K. We model the eclipses as being due to either a transiting geometrically thin dust disk or gaseous accretion disk around a secondary object; the debris disk produces a better fit. We speculate on the origin of such a dense circumstellar dust disk structure orbiting a relatively old low-mass companion, and on the similarities of this system to the previously discovered EE Cep.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} tidal effects in compact triple-star systems. The hierarchical structure of a triple system produces tidal forcing at high frequencies unobtainable in binary systems, allowing for the tidal excitation of high frequency p-modes in the stellar components. The tidal forcing exists even for circular, aligned, and synchronized systems. We calculate the magnitude and frequencies of three-body tidal forcing on the central primary star for circular and coplanar orbits, and we estimate the amplitude of the tidally excited oscillation modes. We also calculate the secular orbital changes induced by the tidally excited modes, and show that they can cause significant orbital decay. During certain phases of stellar evolution, the tidal dissipation may be greatly enhanced by resonance locking. We then compare our theory to observations of HD 181068, which is a hierarchical triply <b>eclipsing</b> <b>star</b> system in the Kepler field of view. The observed oscillation frequencies in HD 181068 can be naturally explained by three-body tidal effects. We then compare the observed oscillation amplitudes and phases in HD 181068 to our predictions, finding mostly good agreement. Finally, we discuss the past and future evolution of compact triple systems like HD 181068. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, published in MNRA...|$|E

40|$|We present new {{photometric}} and spectral {{observations of}} the newly discovered nova-like <b>eclipsing</b> <b>star</b> 2 MASS J 01074282 + 4845188. To obtain a light curve solution we used model of a nova-like star whose emission sources are a white dwarf surrounded by an accretion disk, a secondary star filling its Roche lobe, a hot spot and a hot line. 2 MASS J 01074282 + 4845188 shows the deepest permanent eclipse among the known nova-like stars. It is reproduced by covering the very bright accretion disk by the secondary component. The luminosity of the disk is much bigger {{than that of the}} rest light sources. The determined high temperature of the disk is typical for that observed during the outbursts of CVs. The primary of 2 MASS J 01074282 + 4845188 is one of the hottest white dwarfs in CVs. The temperature of 5090 K of its secondary is also quite high and more appropriate for a long-period SW Sex star. It might be explained by the intense heating from the hot white dwarf and the hot accretion disk of the target. The high mass accretion rate Ṁ = 8 × 10 ^- 9 M_ yr^- 1, the broad and single-peaked Hα emission profile, and the presence of an S-wave are sure signs for the SW Sex classification of 2 MASS J 01074282 + 4845188. The obtained flat temperature distribution along the disk radius as well as the deviation of the energy distribution from the black-body law are evidence of the non-steady emission of the disk. The close values of the disk temperature and the parameter α_g of 2 MASS J 01074282 + 4845188 and those of the cataclysmic stars at eruptions might be considered as an additional argument for the permanent active state of nova-like stars.
