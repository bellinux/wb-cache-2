His first was for a steam boiler furnace with a {{revolving}} bed and a vibrating hopper which distributed the fuel evenly. His calciner was used on the works of most of the tin mines in Cornwall, {{as well as at the}} silver ore works in Mexico, and his <b>fan</b> <b>regulator</b> was also found to be a most useful invention.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple {{design and implementation}} of a remote controlled <b>fan</b> <b>regulator.</b> It enables the user to operate a <b>fan</b> <b>regulator</b> from approximately 10 meters away. The remote transmits a tone using an infrared light-emitting diode. This tone is decoded by a receiver, since the receiver only switches when the tone is received. The system was broken down into simpler functional blocks namely; infra-red transmitter, infra-red sensor, signal amplifier, control logic, sampler, control stepper, output control logic, load and display unit. Details of each subunit are described in the paper...|$|E

30|$|Distribution of {{air flow}} among the airways in mine {{ventilation}} systems may occur either naturally or by adding control devices (<b>fans</b> or <b>regulators).</b> Natural splitting {{occurs when the}} air flows in airways of a ventilation system divided among airways according to their aerodynamic resistance. For controlled splitting, a prescribed quantity of air flow is circulated through each {{or some of the}} airways. In practice, most mine ventilation systems utilize controlled splitting (Wang 1990). To eliminate the risk of mine ventilation hazards, novel optimization scheme alternatives for the complex network variables should be adopted to be rapidly applied in case of emergency to eliminate hazards. Therefore, determination of the locations and sizes of these ventilation control devices representa main challenge in design and analysis of mine ventilation systems (Wang et al. 1985; Wu and Topuz 1987).|$|R
40|$|Power {{consumption}} 1 s now {{the primary}} concern m the semiconductor industry, {{specifically in the}} FPGA industry. Escalating power consumption is a global concern driven by the prevalence of systems packed with multiple integrated circuits (ICs). In addition to environmental concerns, power consumption increases {{the cost of building}} and operating systems. Removing excess heat dictates the use of complex heat sinks, <b>fans,</b> and more <b>regulators,</b> all of which increase capital expenditures. Operating expense increases with total power consumption, comprising both power to drive the devices and the additional power required for cooling. In addition, excessively hot systems result in lower reliability, increasing system down time, and higher operating expense. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of Australia’s prohibition of ‘child-abuse material’ (including cartoons, animation, drawings and text) for Australian fan communities of animation, comics and gaming (ACG) and slash fiction. It is argued that current legislation is out of synch with the new communicative environment {{brought about by the}} internet since {{a large portion of the}} fans producing and trading in these images are themselves minors and young people. Habermas’s analysis of the conflict between instrumental and communicative rationality is deployed to demonstrate that legislators have misrecognized the nature of the communicative practices that take place within the ‘lifeworlds’ of fan communities, resulting in an unjust ‘juridification’ of their creative works. Drawing on Japanese research into the female fandom surrounding ‘boys’ love’ (BL) manga, it is argued that current Australian legislation not only forecloses the fantasy lives of young Australian fans but also harms them by aligning them with paedophile networks. Finally, drawing upon Jean Cohen’s paradigm of ‘reflexive law’ the article considers a possible way forward that opens up channels of communication between <b>regulators,</b> <b>fans,</b> domain host administrators and media studies professionals that would encourage a more nuanced approach to legislation as well as a greater awareness of the need for self-regulation among fan communities...|$|R
40|$|The Subsurface Ventilation System {{supports}} {{the construction and}} operation of the subsurface repository by providing air for personnel and equipment and temperature control for the underground areas. Although the system is located underground, some equipment and features may be housed or located above ground. The system ventilates the underground by providing ambient air from the surface throughout the subsurface development and emplacement areas. The system provides fresh air for a safe work environment and supports potential retrieval operations by ventilating and cooling emplacement drifts. The system maintains compliance within the limits established for approved air quality standards. The system maintains separate ventilation between the development and waste emplacement areas. The system shall remove {{a portion of the}} heat generated by the waste packages during preclosure to support thermal goals. The system provides temperature control by reducing drift temperature to support potential retrieval operations. The ventilation system has the capability to ventilate selected drifts during emplacement and retrieval operations. The Subsurface Facility System is the main interface with the Subsurface Ventilation System. The location of the ducting, seals, filters, <b>fans,</b> emplacement doors, <b>regulators,</b> and electronic controls are within the envelope created by the Ground Control System in the Subsurface Facility System. The Subsurface Ventilation System also interfaces with the Subsurface Electrical System for power, the Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System to ensure proper and safe operation, the Safeguards and Security System for access to the emplacement drifts, the Subsurface Fire Protection System for fire safety, the Emplacement Drift System for repository performance, and the Backfill Emplacement and Subsurface Excavation Systems to support ventilation needs...|$|R
40|$|MFIRE, {{written in}} Fortran 77, is a {{computer}} program for ventilation state simulation in the steady state or transient state condition. It can be applied for the calculation of normal ventilation system planning or {{the analysis of the}} dynamic state variation in a ventilation system under thermal or mechanical disturbance. The state simulator MFIRE is a useful tool for mine fire fighting. In the case of a mine fire, mine ventilation engineers want to get some help to obtain more information, such as {{what is happening in the}} underground mine and how to control the mine fire, for correct decision making. By use of program MF'IRE, forecasts can be made on the variation of airflow, temperature, and contaminant distribution in a ventilation system during a mine fire. The paths which the contaminant takes at each time interval can be traced. The program MFIRE can be of assistance in the preplanning of escape routes. It can also be helpful during a mine fire emergency and mine recovery operation. Besides of offering the information of state simulation during a mine fire, MFIRE can be applied for state control by pretesting the suitability of the selected state control measures. It is to simulate the effects of the state control measures on the airflow distribution of a dynamic ventilation system. The testing result can be used for fire fighting in a similar real case of a mine fire. By employing empirical methods or a qualitative analysis like Budryk approach, ventilation engineers can choose different combinations of locations and sizes of control devices as samples of state control for an underground mine fire. Program MFIRE can simulate the different combination samples, that consist of a certain mine fue, the corresponding different control measures, and obtain the control effects. After the different control results are compared, the state control measure, which creates the best effect among the different state control measures, will be chosen for that fire case. When a mine fire, which is similar to one of the pretested cases, breaks out, the corresponding choice of the state control measure is applied to the ventilation system. It means that the simulator MFIRE has the function of indirect state control [10]. To achieve the above two functions, state simulation and state control, the mine ventilation system condition, sometimes, should be changed in a wide range to meet the requirement of the fire fighting. These wide system condition changes, such as adding operating fans, stopping or reversing fans, changing <b>fan</b> characteristics, adding <b>regulators</b> and making airflow shortcuts are represented in the time table of the input data set When the data files are changed in a wide range, however, an iteration divergence and some other computing errors in the distribution of airflow, temperature, and contaminant may occur. More serious logical programming and flexible selection on the algorithms are wanted to meet the request of the different data sets, to achieve correct state distribution simulation and improve the iteration convergence. To enhance the reliability and common suitability of program MFIRE, it is necessary to make investigation, analysis, and modification for the formal versions of MFIRE. The version 1. 29, permitting dry. calculation, and versions 2. 01 /v 2. 0, permitting dry and humidity calculation, are widely applie...|$|R
