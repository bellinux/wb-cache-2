40|$|Identifying {{the most}} {{influential}} spreaders is one of outstanding problems in physics of complex systems. So far, many approaches have attempted to rank the influence of nodes {{but there is still}} the lack of accuracy to single out influential spreaders. Here, we directly tackle the problem of finding important spreaders by solving analytically the expected size of <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> when spreading originates from a single seed. We derive and validate a theory for calculating the size of <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> with a single seed using a message-passing approach. In addition, we find that the probability to occur <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> is highly dependent on the location of the seed but the size of <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> once it occurs is insensitive to the seed. We also show that our approach can be successfully adapted into weighted networks. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

When analyzing global epidemics this {{force us to}} consider metapopulation models taking into account intra- and inter-community interactions. Recently Watts et al introduced a metapopulation model which accounts for several features observed in real outbreaks [Watts et al, PNAS 102, 11157 (2005) ]. In this work I provide an analytical solution to this model, {{enhancing our understanding of}} the model and the <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> it represents.

This behavior is fur-thermore diminished or enhanced by disassortative or as-sortative connectivity correlations, respectively.

40|$|We {{study the}} classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) {{model for the}} spread of an {{infectious}} disease. In this stochastic process, there are two competing mechanism: infection and recovery. Susceptible individuals may contract the disease from infected individuals, while infected ones recover from the disease at a constant rate and are never infected again. Our focus is the behavior at the epidemic threshold where the rates of the infection and recovery processes balance. In the infinite population limit, we establish analytically scaling rules for the time-dependent distribution functions that characterize the sizes of the infected and the recovered sub-populations. Using heuristic arguments, we also obtain scaling laws for the size and duration of the <b>epidemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> {{as a function of}} the total population.
