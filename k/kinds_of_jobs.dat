30|$|One of the regularities is {{that the}} {{estimate}} for required education {{is larger than the}} estimate for overeducation but both are positive. This means that overeducated workers earn more than correctly matched workers in the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> but less than correctly matched workers with the same education. However, our estimations reveal that the difference in the estimates is much larger for immigrants than for natives. Overeducated immigrants earn only slightly more than correctly matched workers in the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> but much less than correctly matched workers with the same education. Large wage differences between the jobs that correctly matched and mismatched immigrants with the same education have, and compressed wage distributions and no individual wage bargaining within occupations could be the explanation.|$|R
