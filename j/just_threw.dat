For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E

Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

It includes [...] "Tired of Sex", [...] "Getchoo" [...] and [...] "No Other One": songs written before Songs from the Black Hole was conceived, rewritten {{to fit the}} Black Hole concept, and finally rewritten again for Pinkerton. In June 1996, after Pinkertons completion, Weezer recorded the Songs from the Black Hole tracks [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Threw</b> Out the Love of My Dreams" [...] (with Rachel Haden on vocals) and [...] "Devotion" [...] as B-sides for the singles [...] "El Scorcho" [...] and [...] "The Good Life" [...] respectively.|$|E

Lyrics and sheet music were included with The Pinkerton Diaries, a book collecting Cuomo's writings from the era. In 2007, Rolling Stone included Songs from the Black Hole on its list of music's lost [...] "mythical masterpieces".|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} then added tambourine, conga drum and bongos over the coda. This last {{section of the}} song came about while the group were working in the studio. Lennon, who was {{otherwise}} highly critical of [...] "Hello, Goodbye", approved of the addition, saying: [...] "The best bit was the end, which we all ad-libbed in the studio, where I played the piano. Like one of my favourite bits on 'Ticket to Ride', where we <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> something in at the end." [...] In McCartney's recollection, the coda [...] "didn't sound quite right" [...] until Emerick increased the reverberation on the tom-tom drums, at which point, [...] "it just came alive." [...] Everett cites the [...] "Maori finale" [...] {{as an example of}} the Beatles' pioneering use of codas in their recordings; in this instance, they provided [...] "the cold ending followed by an unrelated coda", having similarly pioneered the [...] "fade-out–fade-in coda" [...] at the end of [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever".|$|E

500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know.

500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E

2500|$|On August 29 (McCain's 72nd birthday), at the Nutter Center of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, McCain's {{running mate}} was {{revealed}} in a surprise pick as Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. McCain had only {{talked to her}} a few times, and the campaign's vetting operation had mostly relied on Internet searches to check her background. Palin's career in Alaska had shown maverick tendencies similar to McCain's, and McCain hoped that Palin's youth, reformist record, appeal to social conservatives, and appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters would outweigh her lack of national and international visibility and experience. One of McCain's aides privately remarked via an American football metaphor during the announcement: [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> long." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} over Wilfork's role in causing the fumble.

I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so I just started fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork <b>just</b> <b>threw</b> Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody slides {{into the back of}} you, you're going to fall. That happens a lot in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description in a phone interview with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A second look at the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E

[...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred.
