The commission reviewed 55 cases involving mentally ill people who died or were seriously injured in police custody or following police contact between September 2007—September 2012. Five of the victims died following police restraint and 45 subsequently committed suicide. The review also included 4 cases of suicide by Metropolitan Police officers.|$|E
500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{he praised}} the [...] "beautifully choreographed and shot" [...] action sequences, Murray criticized Flame & Citron for [...] "lean toward the {{handsome}} and thoughtful {{when it could}} stand {{to be a lot}} dirtier and more visceral", citing Black Book as a [...] "superb counter-example". Stempel declared that it [...] "is not as exciting as" [...] Black Book, [...] "but Verhoeven was <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> having to make complex moral decisions instantaneously. Flame & Citron takes its time to turn the screws on its characters, and us." [...] Ella Taylor argued in favor of Flame & Citron, saying it [...] "is the film that the horribly overrated Black Book could have been, had Paul Verhoeven not indulged in the puerile reversals of sensitive Nazis and treacherous partisans." [...] Fuchs also compared the moral dilemmas the characters have to deal with to Black Book and Steven Spielberg's Munich but said Flame & Citron does not have [...] "the splendid surrealish excess" [...] and [...] "the weird conflation of maternal bodies and motherlands" [...] of the two films, respectively. Gleiberman could [...] "feel the shadow of Steven Spielberg's Munich hovering over Flame & Citron".|$|E

500|$|West regains his lyrical dexterity on [...] "Barry Bonds", a competitive, though {{friendly}} {{battle with}} Lil Wayne {{in which the}} two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes. The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West's ability to create music hits. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] is a first-person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for. [...] "Everything I Am" [...] is a song of self-examination, in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his outspokeness ruminating over various ways people expect him to conduct himself. In the track, West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona, his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper, his inclination towards social commentary, and his lack of self-restraint. West comes to the conclusion that while he {{will never be able to}} live up to people's expectations and will always be disadvantageously flawed; it's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is. When writing the song, West thought of a young girl in high school <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> coming down on her.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who put you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try to make her feel down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's a light in me that shines brightly. They can try but they can't take that away from me." ...|$|E

As such, he was typically demanding and direct in his <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who worked on his projects, with his intensity spilling over into all elements of his film-making.

Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.
