In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the Rive <b>Gauche,</b> which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde Mouvement Jariviste, an outcome which reportedly pleased him. In August 1960, one year after the Fifth Republic had been established by President Charles de Gaulle, French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (see Algerian War). Together with Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Jérôme Lindon, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other intellectuals, he addressed Premier Michel Debré a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence. As a result, Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned French Broadcasting Service.|$|E
25|$|In stereochemistry, <b>gauche</b> {{interactions}} hinder bond rotation. For example, sighting {{along the}} C2–C3 bond in staggered butane, {{there are two}} possible relative potential energies. The two methyl groups can be in an anti-bonding relationship, or offset at sixty degree dihedral angles. In the latter configuration, the two methyls {{are said to be}} in a <b>gauche</b> relationship, and the relative potential energy of each methyl-methyl <b>gauche</b> interaction is 0.9 kilocalories per mole (4 kJ/mol). In general a <b>gauche</b> rotamer is less stable than an anti-rotamer.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gauche</b> {{effect is}} very {{sensitive}} to solvent effects, due to the large difference in polarity of the two conformers. For example, 2,3-dinitro-2,3-dimetylbutane, which in the solid state exists only in the <b>gauche</b> conformation, prefers the <b>gauche</b> conformer in benzene solution by a ratio of 79:21, but in carbon tetrachloride it prefers the anti conformer by a ratio of 58:42. Another case is trans-1,2 difluorocyclohexane, which has a larger preference for the eq/eq conformer in more polar solvents.|$|E

40|$|Data {{emerging}} from the International Collaborative <b>Gaucher</b> Group (ICGG) <b>Gaucher</b> Registry together with other contemporary clinical surveys have revealed a close association between <b>Gaucher</b> disease and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma and myeloma and <b>Gaucher</b> disease and Parkinson's disease. Several possible explanations for increased B-cell proliferation and neoplasia in <b>Gaucher</b> disease have been proposed, including the possible influence of sphingosine (derived from the extra lysosomal metabolism of glucosylceramide), gene modifiers, splenectomy and immune system deregulation induced by cytokines, chemokines, and hydrolases released from <b>Gaucher</b> cells. Parkinson's disease is frequently seen in the otherwise-healthy relatives of <b>Gaucher</b> disease patients leading to the finding that GBA mutations represent a genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of the association between GBA mutations and Parkinson's disease {{has yet to be}} elucidated but the pathogenesis appears distinct from that of <b>Gaucher</b> disease.

40|$|<b>Gaucher</b> {{disease is}} caused by {{inherited}} deficiency of lysosomal glucocere-brosidase.

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{explanations}} for the <b>gauche</b> effect: hyperconjugation and bent bonds. In the hyperconjugation model, the donation of electron density from the C–H σ bonding orbital to the C–F σ* antibonding orbital is considered the source of stabilization in the <b>gauche</b> isomer. Due to the greater electronegativity of fluorine, the C–H σ orbital is a better electron donor than the C–F σ orbital, while the C–F σ* orbital is a better electron acceptor than the C–H σ* orbital.

40|$|<b>Gaucher</b> disease, {{caused by}} a {{deficiency}} of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leads to prominent glucosylceramide accumulation in lysosomes of tissue macrophages (<b>Gaucher</b> cells). Here we show glucosylsphingosine, the deacylated form of glucosylceramide, to be markedly increased in plasma of symptomatic nonneuronopathic (type 1) <b>Gaucher</b> patients (n = 64, median = 230. 7 nM, range 15. 6 - 1035. 2 nM; normal (n = 28) : median 1. 3 nM, range 0. 8 - 2. 7 nM). The method developed for mass spectrometric quantification of plasma glucosylsphingosine is sensitive and robust. Plasma glucosylsphingosine levels correlate with established plasma markers of <b>Gaucher</b> cells, chitotriosidase (ρ = 0. 66) and CCL 18 (ρ = 0. 40). Treatment of <b>Gaucher</b> disease patients by supplementing macrophages with mannose-receptor targeted recombinant glucocerebrosidase results in glucosylsphingosine reduction, similar to protein markers of <b>Gaucher</b> cells. Since macrophages prominently accumulate the lysoglycosphingolipid on glucocerebrosidase inactivation, <b>Gaucher</b> cells seem {{a major source of}} the elevated plasma glucosylsphingosine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Type 2 <b>Gaucher</b> {{disease is}} a rare and {{progressive}} subtype of this lysosomal storage disorder, marked by rapid, early-onset neurodegeneration. Distinguishing type 2 from types 1 and 3 <b>Gaucher</b> disease has remained challenging, {{due to the lack}} of a clear correlation between phenotype and enzymatic activity or genotype. beta-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in <b>Gaucher</b> disease, also has an essential role in maintaining epidermal permeability function, by regulating the ratio of ceramides to glucosylceramides in the stratum corneum of the skin. OBJECTIVES: To further assess the diagnostic utility of epidermal evaluations in distinguishing patients with type 2 <b>Gaucher</b> disease in an expanded cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Epidermal samples were evaluated from twenty children with type 2, three patients with type 3 <b>Gaucher</b> disease and two adults with type 1 <b>Gaucher</b> disease with different clinical manifestations and genotypes. Electron microscopy on ruthenium tetroxide post-fixed tissue was performed. RESULTS: Compared to controls and subjects with type 1 and type 3 <b>Gaucher</b> disease, only patients with type 2 <b>Gaucher</b> disease displayed characteristic electron dense, non-lamellar clefts and immature-lamellar membranes. CONCLUSION: The appearance of characteristic alterations in epidermal ultrastructure provides an early and specific diagnostic tool to help in distinguishing type 2 from the other types of <b>Gaucher</b> disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gaucher</b> disease, a {{recessive}} inherited {{metabolic disorder}} caused by defects in the gene encoding glucosylceramidase (GlcCerase), {{can be divided}} into three subtypes according to the appearance of symptoms associated with central nervous system involvement. We now identify a protein, glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB), that acts as an authentic marker of brain pathology in neurological forms of <b>Gaucher</b> disease. Using three independent techniques, including quantitative global proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in samples from <b>Gaucher</b> disease patients that display neurological symptoms, we demonstrate a correlation between the severity of symptoms and GPNMB levels. Moreover, GPNMB levels in the CSF correlate with disease severity in a mouse model of <b>Gaucher</b> disease. GPNMB was also elevated in brain samples from patients with type 2 and 3 <b>Gaucher</b> disease.

40|$|<b>Gaucher</b> {{disease is}} caused by a {{deficiency}} of glucocerebrosidase. Patients with <b>Gaucher</b> disease are divided into three major phenotypes: chronic nonneuronopathic, acute neuronopathic, and chronic neuronopathic, based on symptoms of the nervous system, the severity of symptoms, and the age of disease onset. The characteristics of patients with acute neuronopathic- and chronic neuronopathic type <b>Gaucher</b> disease include oculomotor abnormalities, bulbar signs, limb rigidity, seizures and occasional choreoathetoid movements, and neuronal loss. However, the mechanisms leading to the neurodegeneration of this disorder remain unknown. To investigate brain dysfunction in <b>Gaucher</b> disease, we studied the possible role of inflammation in neurodegeneration during development of <b>Gaucher</b> disease in a mouse model. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α, were detected in the fetal brains of <b>Gaucher</b> mice. Moreover, the levels of secreted nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in the brains of <b>Gaucher</b> mice were higher than in wild-type mice. Thus, accumulated glucocerebroside or glucosylsphingosine, caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency, may mediate brain inflammation in the <b>Gaucher</b> mouse via the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species...|$|R
