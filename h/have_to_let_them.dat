In November 1964 he explained the declaration of Dignitatis humanae: [...] "There are 4,000 Muslims in Rome: {{they have the right to}} build a mosque. There is nothing to say: you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do it".|$|E

40|$|It became {{apparent}} in the beginning that the union was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change their approach and that we, at the cooperative, were going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change ours [...] They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> understand {{that they were not}} the only ones who represent {{the best interests of the}} workers and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> in—to accept that they could bring situations to our attention...|$|R
50|$|However, this oath {{would be}} broken two years later. The Ottoman Empire invaded and started pillaging inside Serbia's borders in 1437. Đurađ {{negotiated}} an unfavorable {{peace with the}} Sultan by giving him the town of Braničevo. In 1438 the Sultan attacked again. This time, the Despot <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> seize Ždrelo and Višesav: the peace that followed was no longer than the previous one.|$|R
6000|$|Margaret {{knew that}} her aunt had in mind their common {{experience}} with the Leightons, whom, to give their common conscience peace, she had called upon with her aunt's cards and excuses, and an invitation for her Thursdays, somewhat too late to make the visit seem a welcome to New York. She was so coldly received, {{not so much for}} herself as in her quality of envoy, that her aunt experienced all the comfort which vicarious penance brings. She did not perhaps consider sufficiently her niece's guiltlessness in the expiation. Margaret was not with her at St. Barnaby in the fatal fortnight she passed there, and never saw the Leightons till she went to call upon them. She never complained: the strain of asceticism, which mysteriously exists in us all, and makes us put peas, boiled or unboiled, in our shoes, gave her patience with the snub which the Leightons presented her for her aunt. But now she said, with this in mind: [...] "Nothing seems simpler than to get rid of people if you don't want them. You merely <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> alone." ...|$|E

The Gracals performed at the Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Two impresarios from Paris {{who have}} been {{scouting}} the show come to see Paul and Jacquot. They recognize Paul as the former dancer {{and tell him that}} his act with Lili and the puppets is ingenious. Paul is ecstatic about this and the offer, but Jacquot tells the agents that they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know. He then tells Paul that Lili is leaving.|$|E
5000|$|The Martins’ [...] "big break" [...] came in 1992 when Michael English and Mark Lowry {{insisted that}} Gloria Gaither {{listen to the}} group {{audition}} in the women's restroom prior to a Gaither Homecoming video recording in Indiana. Gloria told Bill that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> sing in the video. They <b>have</b> gone on <b>to</b> appear in over two dozen Homecoming videos. The group has also recorded over a dozen albums.|$|R
50|$|Acts 4 is {{the fourth}} chapter of the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It records the {{aftermath}} of a healing by Simon Peter and his preaching in Solomon’s Portico, that Sanhedrin arrested the apostles, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go. The book containing this chapter is anonymous but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this book as well as the Gospel of Luke.|$|R

Shwayze and Keeton had a baby boy in November 2010 and named him Hendrix after Shwayze's guitar god hero. Shwayze and Keeton married {{on the beach in}} Kauai, Hawaii, on February 13, 2012. However, on March 2, 2013, a picture of what appears to be Shwayze's wedding band removed from his finger was posted to his {{official}} Facebook, along with a caption reading, in part: [...] "...I am proud of the time we spent together. If you truly love someone you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go and if its meant to be they'll come back to you. This is me letting go. Love u always -A", indicating the couple may be about to split.|$|E
5000|$|A key to McMath's {{ultimate}} legacy may {{be found}} in the memory of those who knew him, if only for a time. [...] "You always left Sid McMath with the feeling, not that you had been with someone important, but that you were important, that your life had been uplifted", Arkansas Circuit Judge John Norman Harkey has said of McMath. [...] "Sid took your cares away. He refreshed your spirit. No matter how down you were before, he made you want to charge back into the battle, but with a smile, knowing, by gosh, we can really win this thing. And we did win." [...] But, of course, McMath did not always win. A stock remark he would offer following a loss was, [...] "The bastards know they've been in a fight. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know you're not afraid to leave your blood on the courtroom floor. I've left a lot of blood on the courtroom floor." ...|$|E
50|$|On 26 June 1938 {{the tanks}} were during a special {{ceremony}} individually named after great French military victories, being baptised with bottles of champagne. De Gaulle {{would use the}} Austerlitz, Rocroi and finally the Yorktown as his personal tank during parades, having a cushion fixed on the turret hatch he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit on, to accentuate his already great physical height; his legs were so long he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> rest {{on the shoulders of}} the driver.|$|R
50|$|Promoted June 5, Capitaine de Corvette (Lieutenant Commander) Philippe Kieffer {{commanded}} {{the operations of}} the 177 men of the 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos, from June 6 in Normandy. They disembarked from landing craft at 0731 hours on Sword beach with Colleville-Montgomery forces in the east of the allied landing. They were the first to be unloaded in this sector with the craft of the No.4 British commandos <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> pass <b>to</b> the lead as initially planned. Their specific objective was to achieve a breach within 500 meters to the west of Riva Bella supporting the 3rd Infantry Division.|$|R

5000|$|He {{opened the}} new Kenrick Seminary in 1915, {{followed}} by the minor seminary in Shrewsbury. He delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Cardinal James Gibbons, and was appointed an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on June 28, 1921. He opposed British rule in Ireland, and supported {{the leaders of the}} Easter Rebellion. The Archbishop once lamented the fact that women were competing with men in the workforce, saying, [...] "Some of the women go downtown in the race and race beside the men...It is regrettable that men <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them,</b> are compelled to let them." [...] Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Glennon declared, [...] "We are not a military nation, but we are at war.... Churches have a duty in time of war not to promote hatred, racial or otherwise. Churches should give their moral aid and their physical support to the nation." [...] He was an outspoken opponent of divorce, saying, [...] "The modern attitude makes a joke of the sacrament of matrimony." [...] He also condemned gambling games as [...] "unworthy of our Catholic people...causing much scandal," [...] and prohibited dancing and drinking at church-sponsored events. The Archbishop sometimes threw the opening ball for the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not play any sports himself, once saying, [...] "I once tried golf, but I so disfigured the scenery that I never played again, in fear of public indignation and reprisal." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{little while}} later Nicholas wrote, [...] "All {{would be well}} if {{everything}} said in the Duma remained within its walls. Every word spoken, however, comes {{out in the next}} day's papers which are avidly read by everyone. In many places the populace is getting restive again. They begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the Duma is going to say on the question. I am getting telegrams from everywhere, petitioning me to order a dissolution, but it is too early for that. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap! And they are gone!" ...|$|R
50|$|By now, {{the church}} has started having ritual sacrifices of {{chickens}} and goats, and Isabelle uses Mort's visions {{of the stock market}} to further her wealth. She also hears of a display of museum artifacts involving devil worship and Count Dracula and has the punkers steal them for her own collection. They're traced to the church by Officer Seligman, who becomes smitten with Eve. He tries to arrest them, but Mort reports a phony terrorist report and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go. That night, the gathering at the church with the relics culminates with an orgy and the death of one of the punkers who impales himself on one of the artifacts.|$|R
50|$|Active {{listening}} is {{a special}} way of reflecting back what the other person <b>has</b> said, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know that you're listening and to check your understanding of what he means.

50|$|Two {{desperate and}} young filmmakers stumble upon the {{ultimate}} subject, a 33-year-old cannibalistic serial killer named Anthony McAllister, who <b>has</b> agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> document {{every aspect of}} his horrifically violent life-style. Initially terrified, the filmmakers get to know Anthony as a person. They even begin to identify with his ecological and philosophical justifications for his cannibalistic lifestyle.|$|R

60|$|According to Cheditafa's earnest assertions, {{they had}} never eaten as they had eaten then. He {{believed}} that the reason they had been left without food was that the Rackbirds were too proud to wait on black men, and <b>had</b> concluded <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> suffer until they had returned from their expedition, and the negroes could be <b>let</b> down <b>to</b> attend to their own wants.|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} {{secondary}} school, Slim Burna ventured into music production. Ogoni native Roarhillz Neebuen {{introduced him to}} rapper M Trill who was then signed with Grafton Records. [...] "I {{got a call from}} Roarhillz that M-Trill wanted to see me. The next day I went over to meet M and he said he had a production job for me at Grafton, after I <b>had</b> agreed <b>to</b> work with him I was interviewed by Tony the manager and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know that I don't work alone, so I brought P Jay along and we began working there", he remembers. During Burna's time at Grafton Records, he assisted in the production of music for artists such as Lilyjean and Lamili. After being falsely accused of theft of company property, Burna left the job and started Street Rhymes. By the end of 2008, he had already begun making beats and creating music in his own studio.|$|R
50|$|However, this {{incident}} made Bing {{feel that it}} was inappropriate for the young Bingyi to remain at the prison, and so he ordered one of his lieutenants to transfer Bingyi and Hu (Guo might have died by this point) to the city government of Chang'an. The city government refused to accept responsibility, and so Bing <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> remain in prison. After Hu's sentence was over, Bing hired her {{out of his own}} pocket to continue to serve as a wet nurse for several months, before letting her leave. Later, the budget for taking care of Bingyi was cut off from the imperial clan affairs budget, and Bing took money out of his own salary to care for Bingyi. When he grew somewhat older, Bing heard that Consort Shi's mother Zhenjun (貞君) and brother Shi Gong (史恭) survived the incident, and so sought them out and <b>had</b> Bingyi delivered <b>to</b> the Shi residence. Lady Zhenjun raised him herself.|$|R

60|$|We join'd our Comrades, {{with a great}} Deal of Ease, {{about three}} Days afterwards, for we march'd but softly, and they lay by for us: The Night before we went on Board, we made them a Signal by Fire, as we <b>had</b> {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know where we were, {{and that we were}} at Hand; so they sent their Boat and fetch'd us off, and we embark'd without any Notice taken by the Rest.|$|R

60|$|This is {{the only}} {{material}} change; for, as it happened that certain characteristics which provoked most discussion in my latest story were present in this my first--published in 1871, {{when there was no}} French name for them it <b>has</b> seemed best <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> stand unaltered.|$|R
6000|$|The fellows laughed; but he {{felt that}} they were a little afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of {{whalebone}} and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> down, the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it that way? ...|$|R
