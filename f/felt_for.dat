5|$|Fame {{does not}} last, however. Nestor {{is not as}} ambitious as his brother and desires {{nothing more than to}} own his own small club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|In 1983's Never Say Never Again, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, {{contemptuous of}} Bond—far {{removed from the}} {{relationship}} shared between Bernard Lee's M and Sean Connery's Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the contempt <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> the 00 section by Fox's M was reciprocated by Connery's Bond. Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E

During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> Kelly and his family from the sentiment {{he was trying to}} convey through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the timely relief efforts, Nicole's effects were still <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> months in its wake. The gross {{domestic}} product for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow economic growth rate, further declined following the extensive damage. The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced egg production due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens, and {{in the face of}} high repair costs the island saw below-standard levels of holiday season consumption.|$|E
5|$|From 4 December 1956 to 26 February 1957, Takechi {{served as}} {{the host of the}} Nippon Television program, The Tetsuji Takechi Hour. The show {{featured}} the Takechi Kabuki's interpretations of such Japanese stage classics as Chūshingura, and was also known for pushing the limits of the coverage of sexual subjects on television for its time. Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the Nissei Theater in Tokyo, not long after it was opened in 1963. Though these would be his last kabuki productions, Takechi's influence on the art form continued to be <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> decades after his departure for the cinema.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relations of}} two dimensions of attachment insecurity (avoidant with mother, preoccupied with mother) to three dimensions of gender identity (gender typicality, gender contentedness, <b>felt</b> pressure <b>for</b> gender differentiation) in preadolescent children. We hypothesized that attachment insecurity (of either sort) fosters <b>felt</b> pressure <b>for</b> gender differentiation but impedes the development of felt gender typicality and gender contentedness. Participants were 863 Black, Hispanic, and White fifth graders attending {{public schools in the}} southeast United States (443 girls, 420 boys; M age = 11. 1 years). Each attachment measure was associated with each gender identity measure in the expected way, but some associations hinged on child gender or ethnicity/race. Avoidant attachment was negatively associated with felt gender typicality only for White children, negatively associated with gender contentedness for the entire sample, and positively associated with <b>felt</b> pressure <b>for</b> gender differentiation only for White children. Preoccupied attachment was negatively associated with <b>felt</b> gender typicality <b>for</b> the entire sample, negatively associated with gender contentedness only for boys, and positively associated with <b>felt</b> pressure <b>for</b> gender differentiation only for girls...|$|R

5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that she believed that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> about 10minutes {{and was so}} violent that all chimneys in the city collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive damage to buildings, only four deaths were reported: a Jewish woman and her baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, and one other victim. The death toll may have been so low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E

25|$|Edgard Victor Achille Charles Varèse {{was born}} in Paris, {{but when he was}} only a few weeks old, he was sent to be raised by his great-uncle and other {{relations}} {{in the small town of}} Le Villars in the Burgundy region of France.

25|$|In 1861, Alfred Austin, {{a future}} Poet Laureate, {{referred}} to 'Skittles' by name in The Season: a Satire, his poem satirising mid-Victorian social mores.
