For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A <b>double</b> major <b>deduction</b> (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground.

In particular, ecotourism has quickly developed as the fastest growing segment within the travel and tourism industry. Recentjgures show that ecotourismgrosses over 335 billion ayear worldwide and attracts millions of interested tourists. One of the government responsibilities is to support the development of tourism economic models and develop new economic indicators that define well-being {{in the context of}} ecotourism development. To encourage more tourism activities, the government has introduced a lot of incentives for the tourism operators to enjoy {{and one of them is}} tax incentives. In Malaysia, tax incentives, both direct and indirect, are provided for in the Promotion of Investments Act 1986, Income Tax Act 1967, Customs Act 1967, Sales Tax Act 1972 and Excise Act 1976. These Acts cover investments in the manufacturing, agriculture, tourism (including hotel) and approved services sectors as well as R&D, training and environmental protection activities.

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an interpretation of Groundwork III which aims to establish two main points: first, that Kant offers there a theoretically-grounded deduction (in Kantian sense) of freedom/morality-as-autonomy; second, that Kant also offers a separate deduction of the categorical imperative. Thus, contrary to what several commentators have claimed, Groundwork III contains a theoretically-grounded <b>double</b> <b>deduction.</b> The second {{objective of}} the paper is to examine and criticize in detail one crucial step in these deductions, namely, Kant’s inference from the speculative spontaneity of reason to the noumenal existence of the subject as a free will. I show that Kant himself came to reject this inference in the B edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, and argue that this explains Kant’s rejection, in the Critique of Practical Reason, of the deduction of the moral law he previously offered.

40|$|In recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) {{project has}} been one of the biggest issues in {{international}} taxation. The OECD refers to BEPS as “tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. ” In 2014, the OECD released BEPS Action 2 as responds on Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (“HMA”s), which are arrangements exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments, entities or transfers between two or more countries. Two of the major factors of HMAs are hybrid entities and hybrid instruments. In Action 2, OECD recommends that counties introduce a “linking rule” that denies the deduction of costs which give rise to HMA outcomes in the payer jurisdiction, such as <b>double</b> <b>deduction,</b> deduction with no inclusion, indirect deduction with no inclusion, as the main measures for addressing HMAs. Among the 15 Actions of the BEPS Project, Action on HMAs is strongly recommended by OECD and G 20 to the 100 countries that plan to implement BEPS. However, considering the historical and economic background of each country, it is difficult to solve HMAs solely with the uniform introduction of a linking rule. Some countries have developed their own countermeasures to HMAs. To successfully counter HMAs, one needs to study the HMA phenomenon and research the current rules. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the ways of responding to the hybrid entities and hybrid instruments of countries including the U. S. and to make policy proposals to solve HMA problems in Korea...|$|E
40|$|A tax on gross assets {{has been}} {{introduced}} in some developing countries where several factors (most notably, high inflation) enabled apparently viable enterprises to report losses for income tax purposes. The idea of a tax {{on the value of}} assets, rather than on the income that the assets generate, seems to have originated in the 17 th century in Milan. It was more recently advocated by Luigi Einaudi and Maurice Allais, but their contributions have remained unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world. The economic implications of such a tax are analyzed in this paper. Special attention is devoted to efficiency and administrative aspects. Practical considerations suggest that the tax on gross assets serves as a minimum income tax rather than as a final tax.

30|$|Preparing {{the next}} {{generation}} of STEM professionals requires critically examining and re-envisioning teaching and learning settings so that spatial thinking is elevated to a targeted objective of learning and is engendered as an essential habit of mind (National Research Council, 2006). First and foremost, spatial thinking is exercised extensively by experts: scientists across the STEM spectrum regularly reason about the relationship between the concrete and theoretical entities they study, their complex spatio-dynamic properties, and how these properties give rise to macroscopic observations. The ability to think spatially has led to some highly visible and significant scientific breakthroughs (National Research Council, 2006; Uttal & Cohen, 2012): Watson and Crick’s construction of the DNA <b>double</b> helix, Rutherford’s <b>deduction</b> of the presence of the nucleus, and Pasteur’s account of light polarizing tartaric salts; all represent discoveries that required extensive thought about the relationship between space and the physical properties of nature. Moreover, retaining and producing more successful graduates in STEM disciplines represents an economic and strategic imperative shared across OECD member countries (OECD, 2012). In the USA, the Obama administration recently set a goal of producing 1, 000, 000 new STEM graduates within the next decade. Troublingly, of the students enrolling in STEM degree programs, currently only 40 % are following these degrees to completion. Students leave the STEM pipeline for myriad reasons, but challenges related to spatial thinking have been identified as an important factor that contributes to their pursuit of alternative careers (National Research Council, 2006; Uttal et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} rise in the awareness and practice of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) globally. Studies covered various dimensions of CSR have been carried out extensively in developed countries, with results varied that CSR active companies outperformed their peers in term of financial returns, others shown no significant correlations while some concluded that CSR activities do not pay. Similar trend of research gained distinctive attention from the developing countries in last decade, particularly in assessing the frameworks, factors and influence of CSR activities towards financial performances and investment returns; whilst others focus on gauging the extent of CSR contributions over companies’ value creation. This study aims {{to examine the relationship between}} CSR and company financial performance in the context of Malaysia. Among the developing countries, Malaysia is avidly promoting and underlying CSR efforts as part of the Government’s blueprint for country’s growth. Positive CSR environment can be seen with both mandatory reporting of CSR for Public Listed companies and incentive policy, including <b>double</b> <b>deduction</b> in the tax computation for CSR activities being extended to 31 December 2020 under 11 th Malaysia Plan. Next, having been classified as one of the dominant Global Islamic financial hubs and undisputable largest global issuer of Islamic Bond - sukuk, it would be interesting to create a link between CSR and some measure of Social Responsible Investing (SRI),represented by shariah-compliant companies as Islamic principles emphasized the importance of ethical responsibility that eliminate all harmful actions that might affect the welfare of the community, which is in line with the purpose of CSR. The findings showed that CSR does impact company’s financial performance in Malaysia, albeit the results are insignificant empirically due to limited sample size. However, it is worth noting that shariah-compliant companies with low CSR activities are more inclined to better financial performance. This may be unique in the context of Malaysia given its strong Islamic financial status where Islamic-based equity investment funds stood at RM 38. 2 billion as at 2014. Overall, the conclusion could be drawn in this paper that positive screening of the companies’ activities in accordance to Shariah principal with certain extent of CSR will create the most value of companies in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|In 2013 the OECD {{launched}} an unprecedented initiative {{in the field}} of international taxation focusing its activity and attention on a new emerging global issue: the erosion of the taxable bases in qualified tax jurisdiction, and the subsequent shifting of profits in fa-vour of others. This (apparently) new phenomenon is originated by the possibility given to the busi-nesses in general (and to MNEs – Multi National Enterprises - in particular) {{to make the most of}} domestic rules and of Double Taxation Conventions in order to allocate the prof-its they make in the most favourable jurisdiction. This strategy should not be confused with tax evasion or avoidance. The two latter situations are currently tackled by specific provisions in different tax systems ranging from tailor-made provisions to GAARs (- General Anti Avoidance Rules - where applicable) to the Abuse of Law doctrine. Base erosion, on the other hand, is a broader phenomenon: it occurs when a business scheme leads to remarkable savings in taxation via the proper application of domestic rules or DTCs (Double Taxation Conventions). In this respect, Academic literature has been warning policy makers and stakeholders from the risks of possible double non-taxation induced by the overlap of DTCs with domestic rules that has ben changed trough years. Traditionally, the OECD intervention in this respect has always maintained one prior-ity: the prevention of (international) double taxation via bilateral instruments (Treaties) inspired by the Model delivered and interpreted consistently with the Commentary also drafted by the OECD itself. The explosion of the global financial crisis and the subsequent increased need for an ever increasing amount of tax revenue by many States belonging to the OECD created however the most appropriate momentum for a change of perspectives. Following the historical momentum, OECD urged for the necessity of a shift of para-digm in international taxation: time has (allegedly) come for a move from the prevention of double taxation to the implementation of an actual taxation of MNEs and cross border profits. In this respect, DTCs, the Model and the Soft law should be interpreted in a way to make actual taxation of cross border income as a certain result, preventing therefore double non-taxation. Ambitious and bold as it is, the BEPS initiative started in 2013 with a number of doc-uments and some as 15 separate actions addressing specific and qualified situations orig-inating base erosion in respective tax jurisdictions: the issue of tax coordination and dou-ble deductions are two of them, with the first being actually a remedy (also) to the sec-ond. <b>Double</b> <b>deduction</b> occurs in cases in which a cost may be deducted in both tax juris-dictions by the same legal entity (a company or a group of companies, if group relief is allowed and the group of company is considered as a legal entity) thus determining and illogic, unfair and ultimately unacceptable reduction of the overall burden. The OECD Report in this respect lists a remarkable number of different cases and sit-uations in which this outcome may be achieved by the taxpayer, without falling into any case of avoidance or abuse. Despite the considerable technical differences, with a rea-sonable margin of appreciation it could be concluded that most of them are determined by legal mismatches of qualification between the two legal jurisdictions and concerning either the flow of income or the legal entity of the case. In this respect asymmetries may concern a legal entity qualified as transparent by a jurisdiction and not by the other, or a specific income considered as an interest paid in the source State (thus deductible for tax purposes) and as dividend in the residence State (thus enjoying a full – or partial – exemption from taxation. Similar asymmetries may also concern the notion of PE (Permanent Establishment) and the ways and means to tax profits attributable to it in the different tax jurisdictions: on the top of that, the existence (or not) of the PE in the view of the two different tax ju-risdictions may also lead to double non-taxation or <b>double</b> <b>deduction</b> of costs. Action n. 2 of the BEPS Report (on Double deductions) describes in details the differ-ent situations listed above and further ways and many o reach the same result without falling into a case of Abuse of law or tax avoidance, with some of the situations depicted that may also potentially be of some interest for the Italian legal system. As a matter of fact, in a recent past, the Italian Supreme Court decided some cases in a way to open a remarkable leeway for base erosion (or profit shifting) by the taxpayer, interpreting a DTC in a way which was perhaps not entirely consistent with the OECD guidelines applicable ratione temporis. The new BEPS initiative should help to prevent from other decisions to be taken in the same direction. While discussion on the BEPS rages on in every OECD Country (and beyond) the case of Italy is however peculiar for purely domestic reasons as well. The Italian Parliament approved very recently an Act (n° 23 passed in 2014) empow-ering the Government to reform the fiscal system making in more simple, accessible, less burdensome for the taxpayer. In this respect it also provided specific guidelines to be re-spected by the Government in its future regulatory activity (with a quasi-legislative effect). It’s noteworthy to read at Article 12 of the aforementioned Act that the Government will have to draft the future decrees “… consistently with the recommendations by supra-national organizations …”. Reference is made of course (and first of all) to the EU soft law, but there’s no literal or legal element excluding the BEPS initiative from that refer-ence. This would arguably be the first case in the recent tax history of the Country in which such a large reference is made to non domestic guidelines by the Italian Parlia-ment, allowing the Government to transform policy guidelines and soft law into legally binding provisions of the Italian law. Even if it’s still too early at this stage to assess whether the Government shall pick the opportunity and make use of this possibility or not, nonetheless it remains in line of prin-ciple the relevance of the opportunity, the impact of the OECD-inspired global order and, eventually, the attempt of making a sort of lex mercatoria fisci which has still to be however drafted in details...|$|E
