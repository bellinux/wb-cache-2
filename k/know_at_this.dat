500|$|In January 2013, Evans {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} have a fairly significant part in the making of the album, stating [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I'm sure we'll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands. It'll turn into a giant panic, I can assure you. That's just how this business is." [...] Later that month, Gaga, after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama's second inauguration, announced the album formally through her Twitter. [...] "And here's me and my handsome date, I simply cannot wait for our album together, he's my darling!" [...] she wrote as a caption for a photo tweeted of the pair, along with revealing the title of the album as Cheek to Cheek.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E
500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to Comfort in Sound, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling yourself out of a big hole".|$|E

2500|$|While {{fans have}} heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, {{implying}} he is bisexual. When asked whether Andrew was specifically gay or bisexual, Pyfrom stated [...] "I really don’t even <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point. I mean, {{he did make}} that statement [...] I think he’s a little more gay than he is straight, though." [...] In [...] "My Husband, the Pig", he refers to Austin as a [...] "dog" [...] and himself as a [...] "dog-lover". Whatever Andrew is, {{he is one of}} a few LGBT teens on television secure with his sexuality. Marc Cherry has commented, [...] "Andrew Van de Kamp is perhaps the most empowered gay teen in the history of television. He's gay and he doesn't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pushing the Senses {{contains}} {{music in}} the same rock styles featured on Feeder's 2002 album Comfort in Sound, but it focuses more on pianos, rather than a string orchestra. Only [...] "Pain on Pain" [...] on the album mainly used strings, including samples from a mellotron. Frontman Grant Nicholas {{said he did not}} think the album needed them. He also called the album the band's [...] "Recovery album" [...] as he felt he was more at ease writing the songs than he was with Comfort in Sound, after the loss of their drummer Jon Lee, alongside stating that he was inspired by artists such as John Lennon within the piano playing and writing the songs. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it.

In April 1484 he was made Provost of Alba, and in September {{of the same year}} treasurer of the Church of Carthage.

"When {{the time}} arrives {{that such a}} girl comes to a house of her own, she comes to it as unskilled in all {{household}} lore, with muscles as incapable of domestic labor and nerves as sensitive, {{as if she had}} been leading the most luxurious, do-nothing, fashionable life. How different would be her preparation, had the forming years of her life been spent in the labors of a family! I <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment a lady at the head of a rich country establishment, filling her station in society with dignity and honor, who gained her domestic education in a kitchen in our vicinity. She was the daughter of a small farmer, and when the time came for her to be earning her living, her parents wisely thought it far better that she should gain it in a way which would at the same time establish her health and fit her for her own future home. In a cheerful, light, airy kitchen, which was kept so tidy always as to be an attractive sitting-room, she and another young country girl were trained up in the best of domestic economies by a mistress who looked well to the ways of her household, till at length they married from the house with honor, and went to practice in homes of their own the lessons they had learned in the home of another. Formerly, in New England, such instances were not uncommon; would that they might become so again!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} {{it was with a}} pardonable feeling of {{agitation}} that I tugged at the wrought-iron bell-pull on the perron of the magnificent mansion in the Avenue du Jura. To begin with I felt somewhat rueful at having to appear before ladies at this hour in my travelling clothes, and then, you will admit, Sir, {{that it was}} a somewhat awkward predicament for a man of highly sensitive temperament to meet on terms of equality a refined if stout lady whose son he had just helped to send to the gallows. Fortunately there was no likelihood of Mme. Fournier being as yet aware of this unpleasant fact: even if she did <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> hour that her son's illicit adventure had come to grief, she could not possibly in her mind connect me with his ill-fortune. So I allowed the sumptuous valet to take my hat and coat and I followed him with as calm a demeanour as I could assume up the richly carpeted stairs. Obviously the relatives of Mme. Fournier were more than well to do. Everything in the house showed evidences of luxury, not to say wealth. I was ushered into an elegant salon wherein every corner showed traces of dainty feminine hands. There were embroidered silk cushions upon the sofa, lace covers upon the tables, whilst a work basket, filled with a riot of many coloured silks, stood invitingly open. And through the apartment, Sir, a scent of violets lingered and caressed my nostrils, reminding me of a beauteous creature in distress whom it had been my good fortune to succour.|$|E
