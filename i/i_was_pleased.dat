[...] During the 1950s, Takemitsu had learned that in 1948 [...] "a French [...] Pierre Schaeffer invented the method(s) of musique concrète {{based on the same}} idea as mine. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with this coincidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Saltzman {{disliked the}} design's {{resemblance}} to a prison, but Hamilton liked it {{enough that it}} was built. The comptroller of Fort Knox later {{sent a letter to}} Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault. United Artists even had irate letters from people wondering [...] "how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?" [...] Adam recalled, [...] "In the end <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it allowed me to do whatever I wanted." [...] In fact, the set was deemed so realistic that Pinewood Studios had to post a 24-hour guard to keep the gold bar props from being stolen. Another element which was original was the atomic device, to which Hamilton requested the special effects crew to get inventive instead of realistic. Technician Bert Luxford described the end result as looking like an [...] "engineering work", with a spinning engine, a chronometer and other decorative pieces.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think when you hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour. Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] at his concerts: ...|$|E

2500|$|...There are, in fact, two {{monitoring}} collections for 1948: one {{compiled by}} the BBC, the other by the CIA, both from Cyprus. There is considerable overlapping between these collections but {{in the interests of}} “checking” and “rejection” they should be studied separately. Both collections give detailed daily coverage of broadcasts from Arab capitals and of such Zionist radios as Haganab Radio (in Hebrew, English, and Arabic); the Free Hebrew Station (Stern) and the Voice of Fighting Zion (Irgun). <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to see that the researchers of Mr. Childers in the British Museum confirm my own findings.

2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption.

2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E
