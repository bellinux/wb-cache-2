25|$|Cases of extrasolar planets {{close to}} a 1:2 mean-motion {{resonance}} are fairly common. Sixteen percent of systems found by the transit method are reported to have {{an example of this}} (with period ratios in the range 1.83-2.18), as well as one sixth of planetary systems characterized by Doppler spectroscopy (with in this case a narrower period ratio range).

It is much more common for pairs of planets to have orbital period ratios a few percent larger than a mean-motion resonance ratio than a few percent smaller (particularly in the case of first order resonances, in which the integers in the ratio differ by one).

25|$|Science {{acknowledges}} reason, empiricism, and evidence, while religions include revelation, {{faith and}} sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations {{with regard to}} the study of the universe. Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time. Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the scientific revolution were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the scientific method were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. During the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham. Roger Bacon, who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar. Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but <b>incomplete</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the world. Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.|$|E

Planning in {{real-world}} environments can {{be challenging}} for intelligent robots due to <b>incomplete</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> that results from unpredictable do-main dynamism, and {{due to lack of}} global observability. Action language BC can be used for planning by formalizing the preconditions and (direct and indirect) effects of actions, and is especially suited for planning in robotic domains by in-corporating defaults with the <b>incomplete</b> domain <b>knowledge.</b> However, planning with BC is very computationally expensive, especially when action costs are con-sidered. We introduce algorithm PlanHG for formalizing BC domains at different abstraction levels in order to trade optimality for significant efficiency improve-ment when aiming to minimize overall plan cost. We observe orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to a standard “flat ” planning approach. ...|$|R

We consider antenna selection with the aim of improving SU and PU capacity and mitigating the effects of <b>incomplete</b> channel <b>knowledge</b> by the SU. Under a minimum PU signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraint, analytical and semi-analytical expressions for the permissible SU transmit power are derived, which are used in obtaining capacity cumulative distribution functions by means of simulations. We show that PU antenna selection is effective at reducing the SU blocking probability, the probability that it cannot transmit, while SU antenna selection leads to significant gains in its capacity. Antenna selection at the SU is also shown to effectively compensate for <b>incomplete</b> channel <b>knowledge</b> and can be used to achieve moderate improvements in PU capacity. I...|$|R

Species.--Species {{are merely}} those {{strongly}} marked races or local forms which when in contact do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct areas are generally {{believed to have}} had a separate origin, and to be incapable of producing a fertile hybrid offspring. But as the test of hybridity cannot be applied in one case in ten thousand, and even if it could be applied would prove nothing, since it is founded on an assumption of the very question to be decided--and as the test of separate origin is in every case inapplicable--and as, further, the test of non-intermixture is useless, except in those rare cases where the most closely allied species are found inhabiting the same area, it will be evident that we have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called [...] "true species" [...] from the several modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they so often pass by an insensible gradation. It is quite true that, in the great majority of cases, what we term [...] "species" [...] are so well marked and definite that there is no difference of opinion about them; but as the test of a true theory is, that it accounts for, {{or at the very least}} is not inconsistent with, the whole of the phenomena and apparent anomalies of the problem to be solved, it is reasonable to ask that those who deny the origin of species by variation and selection should grapple with the facts in detail, and show how the doctrine of the distinct origin and permanence of species will explain and harmonize them. It has been recently asserted by Dr. J. E. Gray (in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1863, page 134), that the difficulty of limiting species is in proportion to our ignorance, and that just as groups or countries are more accurately known and studied in greater detail the limits of species become settled. This statement has, like many other general assertions, its portion of both truth and error. There is no doubt that many uncertain species, founded on few or isolated specimens, have had their true nature determined by the study of a good series of examples: they have been thereby established as species or as varieties; and the number of times this has occurred is doubtless very great. But there are other, and equally trustworthy cases, in which, not single species, but whole groups have, by the study of a vast accumulation of materials, been proved to have no definite specific limits. A few of these must be adduced. In Dr. Carpenter's [...] "Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera," [...] he states that [...] "there is not a single specimen of plant or animal of which the range of variation has been studied by the collocation and comparison of so large a number of specimens as have passed under the review of Messrs. Williamson, Parker, Rupert Jones, and myself, in our studies of the types of this group;" [...] and the result of this extended comparison of specimens is stated to be, [...] "The range of variation is so great among the Foraminifera as to include not merely those differential characters which have been usually accounted SPECIFIC, but also those upon which the greater part of the GENERA of this group have been founded, and even in some instances those of its ORDERS" [...] (Foraminifera, Preface, x). Yet this same group had been divided by D'Orbigny and other authors into a number of clearly defined families, genera, and species, which these careful and conscientious researches have shown to have been almost all founded on <b>incomplete</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E
