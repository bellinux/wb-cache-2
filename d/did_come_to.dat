5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous {{to bring up the}} subject he had come to talk about.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} Arabians were {{exported}} {{from behind}} the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the west {{caught the eye of}} breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, {{and the rise of the}} European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.|$|E
5|$|The Seditionista raid on Ojo de Agua had a vast {{impact on}} American {{military}} {{strategy in the}} area. The severity of the raid led the commanding American general in the region, General Frederick Funston, to reinforce the Texas–Mexico border region with troops and to contact Washington with demands that he be allowed to give no quarter to any Mexican raiders who attacked the United States in the future. Although Washington denied General Funston his request, the raids <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end when Washington finally gave diplomatic recognition to the Mexican government under Carranza. Wishing to maintain {{good relations with the}} American government, Carranza ordered the Seditionista commanders to cease their raiding activities. Without support from the Mexican federal government the Plan of San Diego movement fell apart and there were no further Mexican invasions of the United States until the Villistas raids began in 1916.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
25|$|Weston {{did come}} with a {{substantial}} change, telling the Leiden group that parties in England had obtained a land grant north of the existing Virginia territory to be called New England. This was only partially true; the new grant <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass, but not until late in 1620 when the Plymouth Council for New England received its charter. It was expected that this area could be fished profitably, {{and it was not}} {{under the control of the}} existing Virginia government.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E

25|$|Henry III {{took pride}} in resolving the Gascon crisis so decisively, but his English {{subjects}} feared that the marriage would bring Eleanor's kinfolk and countrymen to live off Henry's ruinous generosity. A few of her relatives <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> England soon after her marriage. She {{was too young to}} stop them or prevent Henry III from supporting them, but she was blamed anyway and her marriage soon became unpopular. Interestingly enough, Eleanor's mother had been spurned in marriage by Henry III and her great-grandmother, Alys of France, Countess of Vexin, had been spurned in marriage by Richard I of England.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled {{for an hour}} and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and expecting him to waste his energy; he even came to the point of smiling to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie's own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E
500|$|According to some accounts, Sing and {{his wife}} were honoured by the local {{community}} when they arrived in Proserpine, Queensland, in late 1918. Other accounts, however, state that although Sing arranged for passage from Scotland to Australia for his wife, {{there was no evidence that}} she made the journey. If Sing's wife <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Australia, it appears that she left her husband after a few years; Tate suggests that the [...] "transition from the green hills and ancient culture of Edinburgh to the dust and rough life of the mining district around Clermont must have been traumatic for Elizabeth Sing" [...] and might have been a reason for her departure.|$|E

500|$|Smart {{was left}} alone, {{except for his}} cat Jeoffrey and the {{occasional}} gawker. It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E
500|$|On May 1, {{the night}} after the Backlash pay-per-view, the {{five members of the}} Spirit Squad were jointly named [...] "Co-General Managers" [...] of Raw. During the night, after drawing [...] "spirit straws", they placed Kenny into a title match with WWE Champion John Cena. Before the match they ordered play-by-play analyst Joey Styles in their office to {{instruct}} him on how to call Kenny's upcoming win (which never <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass), instructing him to do it [...] "with spirit" [...] or they would force him to call all of the following Raw episodes while wearing a female cheerleading uniform. This led to Styles confronting color commentator Jerry Lawler and eventually quitting the show in a worked shoot promo. Kenny lost the match after special referee Triple H, who was conspiring with the Squad, walked out on the match.|$|E
500|$|Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret {{to attend}} court. Writing {{that she wanted}} to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> court, Catherine {{pressured}} her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E

500|$|On 26 July 1941, Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, {{recalled}} MacArthur {{to active}} duty in the U.S. Army as a major general, and named him commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day, and then to general on 20 December. [...] On 31 July 1941, the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, {{under the command of}} Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright. The initial American plan for the defense of the Philippines called for {{the main body of the}} troops to retreat to the Bataan peninsula in Manila Bay to hold out against the Japanese until a relief force could arrive. MacArthur changed this plan to one of attempting to hold all of Luzon and using B-17 Flying Fortresses to sink Japanese ships that approached the islands. MacArthur persuaded the decision-makers in Washington that his plans represented the best deterrent to prevent Japan from choosing war and of winning a war if worse <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> worse.|$|E

[...] Although early settlers <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Avilla, Missouri from Indiana, the Indiana town was documented to have been named seventeen years after the Missouri town, by Judge Edwin Randal in 1875.
