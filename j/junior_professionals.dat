50|$|The NPA Anchors manager {{started his}} {{coaching}} sojourn {{in the second}} division with West Point-based La-Modell International in 1985. Three years later, under Jerico, the club reached the first division. Coach Nagbe led his native Sinoe County to three County Meet tournaments. Under him, Sinoe finished as champions in 1986, third place in 1987 and semi finalist in 2004. Jerico joined IE as Deputy Coach from 1989 to 1992. He then coached <b>Junior</b> <b>Professionals</b> for five seasons (1993-1998). Jerico promoted Junior Pros to the first division {{and went on to}} finished as runners-up in his first season before lifting the league title in 1997. He took Jr. Pros to the African Cup Winners, at which time the club ousted ASFAG of Guinea (but could not continue due the April 6, 1996 fighting in Monrovia). Jerico led Jr. Pros to the African Champions League, and eliminated RCB of Burkina Faso, but were eliminated by eventual grand finalist Obuasi Goldfields a year later. During the 1997-1998 season, Adolph Lawrence hired him at a time Saint Anthony was in search of first division qualification. Jerico did not fail in winning all the seven matches he had. In his debut year with Saint Anthony in division one, Jerico led the club to second place in both league and knockout championships. Jerico had two stints with the Lone Star as Deputy Coach. His first stint ran from 1996 to 1998. On the second occasion, Lone Star reached the 2002 Nations Cup finals in Mali and nearly qualified for the World Cup the same year.

40|$|Cooter and Restrepo {{propose a}} career path model for <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> who can decide {{to stay and}} hope for {{promotion}} to the senior level or leave to take an outside opportunity. In this article their assumption of a uniform distribution for time to promotion is first changed to the more natural and empirically tested exponential distribution. The resulting decision rule for the junior professional becomes very simple and intuitively appealing and can be applied continuously. Additional generalizations of the exponential distribution are then analyzed. Some very interesting results {{on the effects of}} uncertainty are obtained. Myopic decision rules are shown to be nonoptimal in certain situations. However, these changes in the Cooter and Restrepo model are obtained at a cost. The model cannot be closed. The demand for labor is not taken into account., Thus, the supply side is considered in isolation. Nevertheless, the more appealing time to promotion densities used here give better insights into the behavior of <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> within the basic Cooter and Restrepo framework. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that mentorships are quite important {{in the development of}} <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> in a range of fields, including psychology. Yet some evidence suggests that clinical doctoral students may be less frequently mentored by graduate faculty than other psychology doctoral students. Results of a survey of clinical and experimental psychology doctorates who earned the degree in four distinct time frames from 1945 to the present indicated that clinical PhDs (53 %) were indeed less likely than experimental PhDs (69 %) to be mentored. Potential explanations for this discrepancy include the nature of clinical training, diffusion in clinical training, and the advent of professional training models. The implications of less frequent mentoring for clinical doctorates are discussed, and several recommendations for addressing this phenomenon are offered...|$|E

40|$|Senior {{mentors and}} role models have a {{positive}} influence on the career advancement of <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> in law, business, and medicine. In medicine an increasing number of women are pursuing academic careers, but available senior mentors to provide career guidance are often lacking. We report on the results of a national survey of 558 full-time faculty women, aged 50 years and younger, in departments of medicine in the United States, regarding their experience with role models and mentors. Women with mentors report more publications and more time spent on research activity than those without mentors. Women with a role model reported higher overall career satisfaction. This report, with illustrative examples, may be helpful to other women pursuing academic careers and to physicians who serve as mentors or role models to others...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} workgroup gender and race composition on the career mobility of professionals in “up-or-out ” organizations. We develop a nuanced perspective on the potential career mobility effects of workgroup demography by integrating the social identification processes of cohesion, competition, and comparison. Using five years of personnel data from a large law firm, we examine the influence of demographic match with workgroup superiors and workgroup peers on attorneys ’ likelihood of turnover and promotion. Survival analyses reveal that higher proportions of same-sex superiors enhance <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> ’ career mobility. On the flip side, we observe mobility costs accruing to professionals in workgroups with higher proportions of same-sex and same-race peers. Qualitative data offer insights into the social identification processes underlying demographic similarity effects on turnover and promotion in professional service organizations.

40|$|Through {{surveys of}} {{students}} and <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> and interviews with business and government executives, we studied Chinese choices and fairness perceptions in risky health and safety decisions. The survey responses were compared with American responses from an earlier study by Keller and Sarin. The survey {{results show that the}} American and Chinese respondents had similar fairness perceptions, but the Chinese did not make decisions that were consistent with their fairness perceptions, whereas the Americans did. We found that the middle-age Chinese professionals tended to make choices that were more different from the Americans than were the choices of the young Chinese management students. It is likely that these discrepancies were caused by cultural differences, with the younger Chinese tending to face a stronger Western influence. The insights from the survey results were enriched by interviews that revealed fairness perceptions of Chinese business and government executives. A framework to interpret cultural influences on decision making was also proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine how project managers attribute information technology (IT) project success and failure. IT personnel from large Australian organisations completed an adapted version of the Attributional Styles questionnaire, which asked them to attribute causes along a number of attribution dimensions, for IT projects which have either succeeded or failed. The results indicate that IT support workers attribute failure to external factors, whilst attributing success to themselves. On the other hand, executive management took a more balanced perspective which attribute success to external factors and only partially to themselves, whereas they attribute significant personal responsibility for failure. More <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> and operational IT employees can learn from their senior professionals in attributing success and failure. Post-implementation reviews and debriefings conducted by senior IT professionals are ways of passing on their experience in relation to project and self-evaluations. This paper takes a well established psychology theory and applies it to the management of information systems (IS) /IT projects. IS/IT research has not examined how IT professionals attribute success and failure within projects...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance and {{construction}} programs are arguably {{one of the}} most important functions of states DOT’s (as represented by the percentage of the budget invested). On the other hand during the construction period, there are temporary traffic disruptions, which increase the number of accidents with associated deaths and injuring thousand of people every year. Therefore, several states have taken a proactive role in implementing special measures in construction work zones to reduce number of accidents. One of these special measurements is the increase of law enforcement surveillance in construction zones. The work presented herein is part of a project funded by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. This paper focuses on the agencies involved in collecting and storing the data as well as the data used in the analysis. The collection of information from the agencies followed a descriptive research methodology. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the importance of inter-agency collaboration. Furthermore, this paper provide an example of data collected, archiving mechanism and retrieval procedures of each agency involved in this project.

40|$|Extant {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that strategies of diversification and geographic scope expansion carry benefits {{as well as}} costs. However, {{it is unclear whether}} the arguments relating diversification and geographic scope expansion with firm performance are applicable in the specific context of professional service firms (PSFs). These firms are also characterized by particular organizational features, such as the importance of maintaining an optimal leverage ratio, defined as the ratio between <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> and senior ones as partners. Our hypothesis development suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between service line diversification, geographic scope and leverage on the one hand, and PSF performance on the other. We empirically test these relationships using fixed-effects regression and polynomial response surface analysis (RSA) on panel data from 61 German law firms from 2003 to 2012. RSA provides a finely-grained understanding of the relationships among the variables of interest. We find an inverted U-shaped performance effect of diversification and leverage, but no relationship between geographic scope and performance. Moreover, we find evidence of a complementary relationship between diversification and leverage ratio. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for theory and practice...|$|E
40|$|Global and {{national}} law firms alike {{operate in a}} challenging business environment and managing the firm's information and knowledge assets is increasingly viewed as {{a key factor in}} efficient legal service delivery. In legal practice, information management technologies, for example intranets, portals, workflow management systems, document and content management systems, case and project management systems and online dispute resolution systems are becoming important means of legal service delivery. The reason for applying information management technologies and implementing knowledge management strategies in law firms is not only to satisfy clients' growing need for a trusted online platform to interact with legal service providers, but for law firms to capitalise on their intellectual assets, to continuously modernise legal practice management, to empower lawyers, to increase productivity, to use time efficiently, to transfer skills and knowledge from senior to <b>junior</b> <b>professionals,</b> to improve service delivery and to gain competitive advantage. This article firstly reviews the role of information and knowledge management in providing an effective legal service to clients and compares foreign and South African law firms' information management related contexts, challenges and benefits. Secondly, it presents the findings of a survey conducted at South African law firms based on their knowledge management practices.

40|$|The Bachelor of Engineering {{program at}} Central Queensland University, has evolved {{through a number}} of {{innovations}} over 15 years into the unique dual award program of the Bachelor of Engineering (Co-op) /Diploma of Professional Practice. This program is unique in that it includes co-operative education, Project Based Learning (PBL) (in on campus and external modes) and an explicit development of professional practice skills through the Diploma of Professional Practice. This development started in 1994 with the introduction of co-operative education, giving the students two placements of six months each during their study. To help prepare students to be <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> {{at the end of their}} second year of study, a PBL philosophy, with a partially inverted curriculum was introduced in 1998. Recognition that learning from the workplacements would need to be made explicit was addressed by the introduction of the Diploma of Professional Practice in 2004. All the courses in the Diploma are based on reflective practice, and are aimed at developing professional practice skills that are an outcome of the work placements The combined program is designed around the triple themes of intellectual, social and professional development. The result is that students are able to articulate their learning, and recognise their strengths and weaknesses in these areas at any stage in their program of study...|$|E
