5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their host countries. The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their own small businesses. As Song society {{became more and more}} prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt {{was educated}} at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> {{the public schools}} of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, and he {{continued}} his education there. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain {{him for a few}} years. Financially stable, he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the bar of Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there.|$|E

While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she {{asked if he would}} illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in the law, Mercer used his {{substantial}} income to support the arts and amassed a large art collection including many pieces by Carl Ahrens, of whom Mercer {{was a close friend}} and admirer. This art collection was auctioned off in 1925 and was found to contain a selection of art, porcelain, sculpture and antique furniture from around the globe. Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Joan of Arc, Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he {{bought a house in}} Coney Street, central York, as a retirement <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.|$|E

He was {{promoted}} to the brevet rank of major in 1921 but was not promoted substantially until 1930. He returned to the War Office in 1928, where he became Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General in 1930. After ten years as a major {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in 1932. In 1934, he became an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. He became Assistant Director of Shipping and Transport, War Office and was promoted to colonel in 1937 and then brigadier in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In fall of 2003, the 45th Infantry Brigade was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, assuming command of Task Force Phoenix II from 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The purpose of the soldiers' deployment was to assist in training Afghan security forces. Over the next few years, soldiers of the 45th Infantry Brigade, including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, would deploy {{in support of this}} mission. In April 2004, 350 soldiers from the brigade's 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment also {{deployed to}} Joint Task Force Phoenix. During this rotation, the brigade grew the size of the Afghan National Army to over 14,000 as well as fielding a corps-sized force ahead of schedule. In August 2004, the brigade was replaced in this mission by the 76th Infantry Brigade, and subsequently returned home to the United States. The brigade spent three years back <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> that time transformed into an infantry brigade combat team {{as a part of a}} new transformation plan for the Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of Louis XVI style furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|As {{proof of}} the {{successful}} revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs {{of old and new}} acts were sold out, both at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US {{for the first time in}} 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Sammy Hagar. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.|$|E
5|$|Given again {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Steve Harper {{during the following}} season. After a 5–0 qualifying round win, Newcastle progressed to the group stages of the Champions League. He played {{in the first three}} group matches, all of which Newcastle lost. Given found himself out of the team for the next two games, as Harper replaced him in goal. Given returned for the final group match against Feyenoord in the Netherlands, and Newcastle's 3–2 win meant that they qualified for the second round. Internazionale scored four times past Given as Newcastle lost 4–1 in their opening match in the second group stage. Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona, beat Bayer Leverkusen at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Germany (with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie), and drew with Inter at San Siro, however a 2–0 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages. Given played every game in the second round. Given played all 38 league games for the club, as well as his 12 European appearances, as the team finished in third place in the Premier League, meaning the club would enter the Champions League qualifying round in 2003–04.|$|E
