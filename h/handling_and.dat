5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

5|$|In Western societies, the {{domestic}} guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> landing characteristics.|$|E

Fitting-out work then commenced, and was completed by 19 May 1891, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Meteor served with the fleet only briefly; {{this was due to}} her poor <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> excessive vibration at high speed.

5|$|Python was {{conceived}} {{in the late}} 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> interfacing with the operating system Amoeba. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python {{is reflected in the}} title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).|$|E

40|$|IN EXPERIMENTAL {{work with}} chick-ens, {{it is often}} {{required}} to handle birds more frequently than in commercial flocks. This raises the question whether such fre-quent handling would affect certain meas-ures of broiler performance. In the fall of 1960, an experiment was designed to {{study the effects of}} handling frequency on 8 -week weight, feed conver-sion, and mortality in broilers. The experi-ment, covering a period of eight weeks, in-volved four handling frequencies: (1) Birds were <b>handled</b> <b>and</b> weighed once at eight weeks of age; (2) Birds were <b>handled</b> <b>and</b> weighed twice at seven and eight weeks of age; (3) Birds were <b>handled</b> <b>and</b> weighe...|$|R
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} eleven Digimon as playable characters. Eight {{characters are}} available immediately; {{the rest are}} unlockable by completing cup races.

Characters' racing abilities differ through their ranking in three areas: speed, <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
