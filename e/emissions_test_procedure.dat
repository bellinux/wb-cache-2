Since then neither the emission limits nor the test procedure have changed. As stated in several legislative documents the European Commission has now the obligation to review the evaporative <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> in order to improve control of evaporative emissions. In this report the main issues related to real world evaporative emissions and to the impact of ethanol used as transport fuel on the same emissions are addressed.

40|$|Automotive {{three-way}} {{catalytic converters}} are routinely applied {{today in the}} elimination of carbon monoxide, urburned or partially burned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from gasoline engine exhaust gas. Catalyst activity {{in this case is}} only indirectly assessed by means of the measurement of overall emissions during a legislated driving cycle. The specific structure of the driving cycles embodied in a legislated <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> significantly affects catalyst performance. In addition, catalyst behaviour is affected by the levels of raw engine emissions and catalyst inlet temperatures. The latter are strongly influenced by exhaust system design. The above explain easily the difficulties arising when one wants to discriminate between the behaviour of different catalysts in a specific test procedure. The advent of reliable mathematical models of three-way catalytic converter operation allows for a detailed analysis of catalyst performance over the full legislated cycle, which gives more insight into the catalytic activity itself. In this paper, a specific experimental and computational case study is employed to demonstrate the role of mathematical modelling in the detailed analysis of aged catalyst performance during the US and EU legislated test procedures.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO 2) pollution {{in urban areas}} of Europe can be partially attributed to the increasing market penetration of diesel cars that show higher distance-specific nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions than gasoline cars. The on-road NOx emissions of diesel cars, furthermore, appear to exceed substantially applicable emissions standards. This observation raises concerns that the introduction of more stringent Euro 6 emissions standards in 2014 may not adequately reduce the distance-specific on-road NOx emissions of new diesel cars. We address the existing concerns by analyzing the gaseous emissions of one novel Euro 6 diesel car and six Euro 4 - 5 diesel cars with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). We find that the average on-road NOx emissions of the Euro 6 car (0. 21 ± 0. 09 gram per kilometer [g/km]) are considerably {{lower than those of}} the Euro 4 cars (0. 76 ± 0. 12 g/km) and the Euro 5 cars (0. 71 ± 0. 30 g/km). The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system of the Euro 6 diesel car is suitable to limit NOx emissions during real-world on-road driving. Still, all tested cars, including the Euro 6 diesel car, exceed their NOx emissions standards on the road by 260 ± 130 %. This finding suggests that the current type-approval procedure does not adequately capture the on-road NOx emissions of diesel cars. By introducing a complementary <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> that covers a wide range of normal operating conditions, the European legislative authorities can address this problem and ensure that Euro 6 will indeed deliver an adequate reduction in the NOx emissions of new diesel cars.

40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single carbon canister. The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full evaporative <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> was simulated, enabling the calculation of evaporative emissions from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of evaporative emissions from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on evaporative emissions, namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of evaporative emissions depends largely on the canister condition. A well purged canister, e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. Evaporative emissions in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total evaporative emissions. The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of evaporative emissions from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|E
40|$|Light-duty diesel {{vehicles}} emit on {{the road}} substantially more nitrogen oxides than permitted by regulatory emissions standards. The European Commission addresses this problem by developing a complementary <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> for the type approval and in-service conformity testing of these vehicles. To facilitate the technical development, the European Commission established in January 2011 the Real-Driving Emissions - Light-Duty Vehicles (RDE-LDV) working group that {{is open to all}} stakeholders. This report presents the results of the technical assessment that was carried out by the RDE-LDV working group for two candidate procedures: (i) emissions testing with random driving cycles in the laboratory and (ii) on-road emissions testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). Both procedures are technically feasible. However, PEMS on-road testing appears to be more effective than random-cycle testing in limiting the pollutant emissions of light-duty vehicles because it (i) allows a wider range of driving conditions to be covered and (ii) might more effectively prevent the detection of emissions tests and the use of defeat strategies. Nonetheless, PEMS on-road testing faces practical challenges, including open safety issues, the currently limited availability of PEMS equipment, and potential climatic, geographical, and seasonal constraints for the execution of emissions tests. Random-cycle testing presents advantages over PEMS on-road testing in that already established laboratory equipment and know-how to be used. The present assessment is subject to uncertainty because the implementation and running costs as well as the overall effectiveness of the two candidate procedures depend on the definition of concrete boundary conditions (e. g., permitted test temperatures, severity of driving patterns). These definitions are not yet agreed. Accounting for the resulting uncertainty, it has been decided that the JRC will develop a PEMS-based test procedure. Vehicle manufacturers are given the opportunity to develop a random cycle-based test procedure. A decision will be made regarding the implementation for type approval and in-service conformity testing based on a comparison of the two fully developed test procedures by the end of 2013. JRC.

To address this hypothesis, we present the first comprehensive on-road <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> of light-duty vehicles based on state-of-the-art Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS).

On-road carbon dioxide emissions surpass laboratory emission levels by 21 ± 9 % and exceed the fleet-average emission target for passenger cars by 32 ± 20 %.

40|$|Air quality {{issues in}} urban areas are always a big concern. Air {{pollution}} especially NO 2 and PM exceedances in cities are common. This is particularly true with congested traffic and the monitoring station is at the roadside. It {{is well known that}} road transport in the urban area is a major source of air pollution. Though all the vehicles have to comply the EU emission standards, the <b>emissions</b> were <b>tested</b> using the legislated standard driving cycles, which could not represent real world driving emissions. This is because compared to the legislated driving cycle, the real world driving uses different powers, different average speeds, different traffic congestion, different road gradients, different maximum acceleration rates, different cold start conditions, different numbers of stop/start events and occurs at different ambient temperatures and pressures and will inevitably have different emissions. In recognition of importance of real driving emissions, the EU plans to introduce RDE (Real driving <b>emission)</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> in 2017. This work investigated real world emissions on a congested road by a roadside air quality monitoring station that exceeds European air quality standards for NOx and PM using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) and a Euro 4 SI passenger car. The PEMS used was the Temet FTIR with Horiba OBS pitot tube exhaust mass flow sensor and gas sampler. Twenty nine hot start repeat journeys were conducted at different times of the day (morning and evening rush hours, lunch time, night) so that a range of traffic conditions were included and eight cold start tests for the same journeys were conducted and compared with the hot start results and shown to give significantly higher emissions.

40|$|<b>Emissions</b> <b>testing</b> in the {{laboratory}} forms {{an essential part of}} the European type approval procedure for light-duty vehicles. The approach yields reproducible and comparable results and provides clear design criteria for vehicles that have to comply with applicable emission limits. Although emission limits have become increasingly stringent in the past decade, road transport remains the most important source of urban air pollution with respect to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide in Europe. Several studies have indicated that in particular on-road nitrogen oxide emissions of light-duty diesel vehicles might substantially exceed emission levels as identified in {{the laboratory}}. Here, we address this problem by using Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) to analyze the on-road emissions of 12 light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles on four test routes, representing rural, urban, uphill/downhill, and motorway driving. The results indicate that average NOX emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 g/km), including Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), substantially exceed the respective emission limits. The observed deviations range from a factor of 4 - 7 for NOX emission averages over entire test routes up to a factor of 14 for NOX emissions of individual averaging windows. By comparison, on-road NOX emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as CO (carbon monoxide) and THC (total hydrocarbon) emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay within Euro 3 - 5 <b>emission</b> limits. The <b>tested</b> light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles emit during on-road testing on average 189 ± 51 g CO 2 /km (grams carbon dioxide per kilometre) and 162 ± 29 g CO 2 /km, respectively, thereby exceeding the CO 2 emissions as specified during laboratory testing by on average 21 ± 9 %. The cold-start emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles span over a large value range; NOX emissions exceed Euro 3 - 5 emission limits by a factor 2 - 14, CO emissions often exceed emission limits, and THC emissions are both below and above Euro 3 - 5 emission limits, respectively. The PEMS equipment is reliable and provides accurate emission measurements. PEMS are able to verify the proper operation of emission control technologies under a wide variety of normal operating conditions as well as <b>test</b> <b>emissions</b> from novel fuel/engine/after-treatment/powertrain technologies (e. g., parallel/serial (plug-in) hybrid vehicles. The PEMS procedure for light-duty vehicles is, however, relatively new and requires further refinement before being applied at large scale.

40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of people living or {{spending}} substantial time near major roadways, being exposed to elevated traffic-related pollutants. Due to their adverse health effect, it is imperative to reduce the uncertainties in the traffic emission inventory and characterize the spatial and temporal impacts of pollutants on near-road air quality, which is critical to assessing human exposure. This dissertation presents the development and applications of an environmental turbulent reacting flow model, the Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model. CTAG is designed to simulate the transport and transformation of multiple air pollutants in various environments. For near-road applications, CTAG couples the major turbulent mixing processes with gas-phase chemistry and aerosol dynamics. CTAG demonstrates that significant improvement in predicting the spatial gradients of pollutants near roadways can be achieved by detailed treatment of turbulence characteristics. It is commonly assumed that the NO 2 /NOx ratio by volume for most roadways is 5 %. However, this dissertation is the first to show that this assumption may not be suitable for most roadways, especially those with a high fraction of heavy-duty truck traffic. It also illustrates that the dynamics of exhaust plumes are highly sensitive to vehicle-induced turbulence, sulfuric acid induced nucleation, and condensation of organic compounds. It simulates, for the first time, the multi-scale aerosol dynamics and microenvironmental air quality by introducing a multi-scale structure to generate the processed on-road particle emissions. It implies that roadway and surrounding infrastructure designs can affect near-road air quality. CTAG can be used to improve the regulatory model in assessing the air quality in near-road environments. The turbulent reacting flows inside the fabricated dilution systems are also investigated since they are essential to most <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> and share the same mechanisms with the atmospheric dilution. CTAG investigates the effects of the dilution parameters and illustrates that turbulence plays a crucial role in mixing the exhaust with the dilution air, and the strength of nucleation dominates the level of particle emissions. A potential unifying parameter, the dilution rate of exhaust, is found to play an important role in new particle formation. Using the CTAG model, urban planners have the potential to develop strategies to reduce the uncertainties associated with dilution samplings and define a standardized dilution sampling methodology for characterizing emissions from multiple combustion sources. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R

The chassis dynamometer testing included the FTP- 75 <b>emissions</b> certification <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> highway fuel economy test, US 06 aggressive driving cycle conducted at 0 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C, and the SC 03 test performed at 35 °C with the air conditioning on and with the air conditioning off. Data collection included bag and continuously sampled emissions (for the chassis tests), engine and vehicle operating parameters, battery cell temperatures and voltages, motor and auxiliary currents, and cabin temperatures. Test results are being used in three NREL program areas including: correlation and enhancement of the ADVISOR model; understanding battery performance under various conditions {{and the development of a}} temperature dependent battery pack model; and to determine the effect of air conditioning on fuel economy and emissions from highly efficient vehicles. Results from the testing have shown good agreement with predicted behavior and published data. Detailed test data have also yielded important insights into the vehicle control strategies and component performance that have been incorporated into ADVISOR...|$|R
5000|$|Sensors and {{electronic}} components in modern light-duty vehicles {{are capable of}} 'detecting' the start of an <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> in the laboratory (e.g., based on acceleration sensors or not-driven/not-rotating wheels). Some vehicle functions may only be operational in the laboratory, if a predefined test mode is activated. Detecting <b>emissions</b> <b>tests</b> is problematic {{from the perspective of}} emissions legislation, because it may enable the use of defeat devices that activate, modulate, delay, or deactivate emissions control systems with the purpose of either enhancing the effectiveness of these systems during <b>emissions</b> <b>testing</b> or reducing the effectiveness of these systems under normal vehicle operation and use. While the use of defeat devices is generally prohibited, exceptions exist in cases where it is necessary to protect the engine against damage and to ensure safe vehicle operation (EC, 2007). These exceptions leave room for interpretation and provide scope, together with the currently applied <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> for tailoring the emissions performance ....|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} design, fabrication, and high {{gradient}} testing of a 17. 1  GHz photonic band-gap (PBG) accelerator structure. Photonic band-gap (PBG) structures are promising candidates for electron accelerators capable of high-gradient operation {{because they have}} the inherent damping of high order modes required to avoid beam breakup instabilities. The 17. 1  GHz PBG structure tested was a single cell structure composed of a triangular array of round copper rods of radius 1. 45  mm spaced by 8. 05  mm. The test assembly consisted of the test PBG cell located between conventional (pillbox) input and output cells, with input power of up to 4  MW from a klystron supplied via a TM_{ 01 } mode launcher. Breakdown at high gradient was observed by diagnostics including reflected power, downstream and upstream current monitors and visible light <b>emission.</b> The <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> was first benchmarked with a conventional disc-loaded waveguide structure, which reached a gradient of 87 [*][*]MV/m at a breakdown probability of 1. 19 × 10 ^{- 1 } per pulse per meter. The PBG structure was tested with 100  ns pulses at gradient levels of less than 90 [*][*]MV/m in order to limit the surface temperature rise to 120  K. The PBG structure reached up to 89 [*][*]MV/m at a breakdown probability of 1. 09 × 10 ^{- 1 } per pulse per meter. These test results show that a PBG structure can simultaneously operate at high gradients and low breakdown probability, while also providing wakefield damping...|$|R
40|$|The Air Resources Board (ARB or Board) {{will conduct}} a public hearing {{at the time and}} place noted below to {{consider}} adopting a regulation to reduce emissions of diesel particulate matter (diesel PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and greenhouse gases from inuse on-road diesel vehicles that operate in California. The proposed regulation would also establish requirements for any in-state or out-of-state motor carrier, Californiabased broker, or any California resident who hires or dispatches vehicles subject to the regulation. The Board will also consider amendments to several existing regulations to ensure that these regulations and the proposed regulation work together effectively, to clarify a number of issues with the existing regulations to provide additional compliance flexibility, and to improve enforceability in general. Specifically, the proposal would amend existing regulations for in-use off-road diesel vehicles, mobile cargo handling equipment at ports and intermodal rail yards, in-use on-road diesel-fueled heavy-duty drayage trucks, on-road heavy-duty diesel-fueled vehicles owned or operated by public agencies and utilities, reducing idling emissions from new and in-use trucks, heavy duty engines and vehicle exhaust <b>emissions</b> standards and <b>test</b> <b>procedures,</b> the airborn...|$|R

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of fossil energy resources {{in conjunction with}} increasing demand has recently created record commodity price rises. Global warming and dimming {{are some of the}} harmful effects of increasing use of this resource. Furthermore, fossil fuel exhaust emissions, produced in internal combustion engines (ICE), generate significant health concerns. For decades, fears and numerous alarms have been raised regarding these problems. Many researchers believe that hydrogen would be an ideal alternative solution. Reduced fossil fuel consumption and lower thermal emanations (CO, CO 2, HC and NO) are expected if hydrogen is used, as a principal or supplementary fuel, in standard ICE’s. However, hydrogen dual-fuel use has historically been associated with injection and/or detonation problems. Direct injection (DI) strategy, in spark and compression engines, is commonly used to overcome some, but not all, of these difficulties. This experimental research investigated detonation free, diesel-hydrogen fuel consumptions, and exhaust emissions using an indirect injection (IDI) strategy in a generic compression diesel engine. A novel analogue Mechatronic Injection Unit (MICU) in conjunction with a multi point injection tactic (MPI) were devised to indirectly deliver low pressure hydrogen to a stationary Lister-Pitter diesel engine combustion chamber. The hydrogen injection system was created {{to be used as a}} generic dual-fuel kit. With off-the-shelf parts the MICU design was simple, robust, and purposeful in its function. The MICU component also formed an important element of a proposed innovative dual-fuel conversion kit. Nine hydrogen injection rates were tested. Diesel consumption savings were measured and the ‘effectiveness’ of hydrogen vitiated injection was computed. The research outcomes demonstrated that with a conventional diesel mechanical governor and an assumed engine compression ratio of 15. 5, detonation free combustion can be achieved with low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment. However, an injection rate limit existed above which detonation occurred. The study also demonstrated that through low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, diesel consumption savings were achieved. The research confirmed that the experimental fuel mass savings were lower than their expected/theoretical counterparts. The research particularly established that vitiation and enrichment effectiveness was only realised at low rather than high loads indicating that hydrogen achieved more than diesel mass substitutions. In this study a new confined area dual-fuel static <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure,</b> coupled with an on-site use test cycle was proposed and termed the Dual-fuel fixed speed emission-testing guideline. Dry thermal emissions were measured, and both the cycle average and median dry- and wet-emissions were computed, substance/species comparisons were performed and conclusions were drawn. The shortcomings of the procedure however were also highlighted. Finally, the research established that one action or measure, such as dual-fuel hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, can not address all the environment and health concerns. Contrary to the common belief, green house gases, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and opacity substances do not coincidently all increase and/or decrease. Indeed, this experiment demonstrated that although the diesel-hydrogen nitrogen monoxide (NO) wet-emissions at all injection rates were partially lower than the diesel baseline, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon emissions, opacity (N) and absorption coefficients (k) were higher. In other words, a measure taken to limit the harm done to human health can increase the damage to the environment and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Two new, {{low cost}} {{methods used to}} {{identify}} inefficient or damaged catalytic converters were evaluated on in-use vehicles. The first technique was a non-intrusive propane injection catalyst <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> developed by General Motors {{as part of their}} overall diagnostic strategy. The second technique utilized an Olympus fiber-optic borescope to visually assess the condition of catalytic converter substrates. Results from the two new techniques were compared against those from standard modal catalyst testing and IM 240 tailpipe <b>emission</b> <b>testing.</b> The test results from seventy vehicles show the propane injection test to be generally effective at discriminating between converters with high and low conversion efficiencies. The fiber-optic borescope was less successful in identification of inefficient catalysts. This is because some catalyst failures are not readily identifiable while others have identifiable problems, but continue to perform at reasonable efficiencies...|$|R
