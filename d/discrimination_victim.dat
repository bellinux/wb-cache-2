40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} after-acquired evidence to defeat a <b>discrimination</b> <b>victim</b> 2 ̆ 7 s claim against her employer. The use of the Mount Healthy and Price Waterhouse mixed motives analysis in after-acquired evidence cases is misplaced because {{it is impossible for}} the permissible motive—resume fraud—to have been a factor in the adverse employment decision. Furthermore, after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, it would be an improper judicial intrusion upon the power of the legislature for courts to apply mixed motives analysis to these cases. Besides the constitutional limitation on the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s power created by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, public policy dictates that defendants be held liable for intentionally and illegally discriminating against their employees. In order for the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991 to work effectively to eliminate unlawful discrimination in the workplace, defendants must have no means or incentive to escape liability for their wrongful acts. If after-acquired evidence is subject to the mixed motives analysis, a defendant who discriminated illegally against its employee would have every incentive to search for information in the employee 2 ̆ 7 s background which could be used to question her truthfulness on her employment application. This search would take place whether or not the employee had misrepresented material facts on the application. It would lead to more costly, prolonged discovery in an age where the courts are attempting to trim pretrial proceedings. Moreover, knowledge that the employer may search the employee 2 ̆ 7 s background if the employee files suit against the employer may have a chilling effect on civil rights claims, deterring deserving plaintiffs from bringing discrimination claims. This article sets forth a proposal for dealing with after-acquired evidence in Title VII cases that accounts for employers 2 ̆ 7 legitimate interests {{as well as those of}} employees and the public in eliminating discrimination in the workplace...|$|E

40|$|In one of {{its most}} {{controversial}} decisions in years, the Supreme Court in May issued a 5 - 4 ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire 2 ̆ 6 Rubber Co. that severely undercuts the ability of pay <b>discrimination</b> <b>victims</b> to enforce their rights under Title VII, the main federal anti-employment-discrimination statute. In its decision, the Court applied the statute of limitations in a way that ignored the realities of both pay discrimination claims, specifically, and workplace bias more generally. In so doing, it imposed an obstacle that will gravely inhibit the ability of bona fide <b>discrimination</b> <b>victims</b> to assert their rights. This article will examine Ledbetter’s negative impact on rights claiming under Title VII and map out the legislative fix necessary to restore statutory protection against pay discrimination...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{remains a}} key {{predictor}} of vocational choice. The present thesis aimed to investigate three social psychological barriers to nontraditional career choice. Study Ӏ showed that threats to gender identity {{may lead to}} more gender-typical occupational preferences among adolescents. The results suggested a unique effect of gender identity threat, as a control threat {{did not have the}} same effect. Moreover, individual differences in gender identity concerns predicted gender-typed preferences. Study ӀӀ proposed an effect of gender-typical educational choice as a consequence of social needs. Because people tend to have predominantly same-gender friends, those who adjust their choice of education to be with their friends are likely to acquire a more gender-typical education and, consequently, occupation. The findings suggest that adolescents are more likely to adjust their educational choice in line with same-gender friends. Furthermore, perceived education compromise in line with friends was related to having selected a more gender typical field of study. Study ӀӀӀ revealed that people’s perceptions of gender discrimination in hiring are guided by discrimination prototypes of the typical <b>discrimination</b> <b>victim,</b> rather than same-gender bias. Both men and women tend to interpret an ambiguous outcome on the labor market as discrimination if the applicant is female. Furthermore, observing a woman being declined job interviews in male-typed occupations led to work-seeking discouragement, and this effect was mediated by attributions to discrimination. Discrimination attributions in prototypical cases were found to be exaggerated compared to the prevalence of actual gender discrimination in hiring. To conclude, the present thesis suggests that gender identity threat, friendship priorities, and perceived discrimination may prevent individuals from exploring their full range of career opportunities. First, gender identity threat may affect adolescents so that they do not even form aspirations for gender atypical occupations. Second, even if there is some interest in nontraditional occupations, the need to preserve close relationships will push people away from domains where they have no friends (usually domains where their gender is in minority). Finally, when young men and women are about to enter the labor market, exaggerated perceptions of the prevalence of discrimination can become an obstacle to their motivation to pursue certain careers...|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court decided two {{landmark}} cases, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, that interpreted Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 (b) ’s pleading requirement. The Court {{shifted from}} a notice pleading standard {{to one that}} requires more factual substantiation of claims before allowing discovery. This has important ramifications {{in the area of}} employment discrimination, as courts dismiss these claims disproportionately. If the Supreme Court’s new pleading standard is read to allow more judicial subjectivity, it could bar employment discrimination plaintiffs from access to courts. Lower courts often misconstrue the legal standard for a hostile work environment, thereby resulting in the disposition of meritorious claims. This Note explores two different interpretations of the new pleading standards, one where judicial discretion is unbridled and the other where strong limitations on discretion still exist. For the welfare of hostile work environment <b>discrimination</b> <b>victims,</b> lower courts should apply the latter interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Congress {{declared}} {{the enactment of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1991 a victory for women and civil rights advocates. After all, before the Civil Rights Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, white women could not recover damages for intentional sex <b>discrimination.</b> <b>Victims</b> of sex <b>discrimination</b> were limited only to equitable relief such as back pay, reinstatement, and injunctive relief. So, Congress said, the Civil Rights Act was a victory because white women who sued under Title VII could finally recover damages. But the 2 ̆ 2 victory 2 ̆ 2 was only partial. The Civil Rights Act capped a victim 2 ̆ 7 s recovery to a maximum of 300, 000 in combined compensatory and punitive damages, a stark contrast to the unlimited compensatory and punitive damages available to black women who sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1981. Congress said that capped damages was the best remedy they could provide under the circumstances. It was a compromise necessary to secure passage of the bill.

The Equal Pay Enforcement Act was passed in 2009 {{in response to the}} large gap between the wages {{of men and women in}} Wisconsin. Among other provisions, it allowed workplace <b>discrimination</b> <b>victims</b> redress in the less costly and more accessible state court system, rather than in federal court. Defending the repeal, Walker stated that the Act had essentially been nothing but a boon for trial lawyers, incentivizing them to sue job creators, including female business owners, and that the law was being used to clog up the legal system in his state. While it is still illegal in Wisconsin to pay women less on the basis of their sex, the repeal was criticized for reinforcing the gender pay gap, a recurrent theme in the struggle for women's rights. Republican State Senator Glenn Grothman said of the repeal, [...] "You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious."

40|$|This Essay {{analyzes}} {{a particular}} kind of justification for affirmative action in higher education. Ronald Dworkin, in Taking Rights Seriously, advances the position that the insult felt by <b>victims</b> of <b>discrimination</b> has a pivotal effect on the meaning of the act of discrimination, thus rendering the targets of such <b>discrimination</b> <b>victims,</b> and making the discriminatory act unethical and illegal. Conversely, the absence of such insult to those merely denied benefits by policies of affirmative action renders their objections impotent and makes affirmative action an ethical and lawful policy. In this Essay, I assess the confluence of ethical, legal, and psychological issues in Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s arguments about affirmative action. I argue that Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s defense of affirmative action, using ascriptive characteristics as a consideration in admissions or other awards procedures, is inadequate to demonstrate the justice or constitutionality of the policy, even when used as a remedy for past or continuing discrimination. In assessing Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s psychology and the empirical component of his argument centered on the notion of 2 ̆ 2 insult, 2 ̆ 2 I attend particularly to the legitimacy of different kinds of preferences and to the question of psychological harm done to the <b>victims</b> of <b>discrimination.</b> Affirmative action is characterized by two features. First, it is a remedial policy, designed to help overcome the legacy of past discrimination and to counter the effects of continuing {{discrimination on the basis of}} race or other ascriptive characteristics. Second, it is a discriminatory policy in the sense that, as a means of offering a remedy for wrongful discrimination, it differentially weighs ascriptive characteristics that would otherwise be impermissible to consider in admissions or other award decisions. Affirmative action has taken many forms, from individualized attention to the diversity that an applicant is likely to contribute to a school class because of his or her characteristics, to the formulaic application of a fixed numerical advantage to university applicants of preferred races, to the use of quotas that require a certain percentage distribution of characteristics among a selected population. Most share the feature of using remedial discrimination, discriminating on the basis of characteristics which it would normally be wrong to weigh, and doing so to remedy other wrongs...|$|R
