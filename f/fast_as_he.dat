5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> previously could. Doc Bennett, {{the manager of a}} nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Having failed as a spin bowler in a {{trial at}} Richmond in 1950, Meckiff {{switched}} to fast bowling in 1951–52 when he began his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne. He started in the Fourth XI after his brother had to withdraw from a match. The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI, although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised. At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, without regard for accuracy—a plan he successfully adopted.|$|E
5|$|Although not as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E

Ryan completed 17-28 for 199 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|E

When Steve {{questions}} him on {{why he is}} cleaning it, Roger reveals he is using {{it in order to}} have sex with Snot. At the Wild West Land amusement park, Steve spills the news to Snot, showing the stress ball as proof. Devastated, Snot ends his relationship with Roger, which upsets Roger as well. Steve brings back up his original 31 flavors idea, but Snot still remains depressed from his broken relationship. Steve devises another idea to get him and Roger back together. In his Jenny disguise, Roger meets Snot again and apologizes for his past actions, and Snot accepts him back into their relationship again, at least until Roger gets hit and killed by a bus, much to Snot's depression once again until Steve tells Snot he has gotten closer to having sex with someone than anyone in the group has ever been. Roger shows up again at the scene in another disguise and tells Steve that he faked his death, explaining his ability to move very <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sets up a decoy of his Jenny persona right before the bus hits it.|$|E

In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
