5|$|<b>Hispanics</b> <b>are</b> {{more highly}} {{represented}} among enlisted {{personnel in the}} Marine Corps than in the other services. On June 27, 2003, Sergeant Major John L.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extremely limited {{population-based}} {{data are}} available describing recent and temporal trends in the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: This was a community-based, observational study of 9649 greater Worcester residents hospitalized in all hospitals serving the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area in 12 one-year periods between 1975 and 1999. In the total study sample, 171 (2 %) patients <b>were</b> <b>Hispanic.</b> <b>Hispanic</b> patients <b>were</b> matched with 395 non-Hispanic white patients {{on the basis of}} age, sex, and year of hospitalization. RESULTS: <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> more likely to present to greater Worcester hospitals with a history of diabetes as compared with non-Hispanic whites. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> less likely to have an initial, Q-wave AMI during the index hospitalization. After controlling for a limited number of known potentially confounding factors, <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> at lower risk for development of heart failure (OR, 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 41, 0. 96). Both Hispanics (13 % vs 11 %) and non-Hispanic whites (28 % vs 9 %), however, had declines in hospital case-fatality rates between 1975 and 1999. An overall similar treatment pattern and increasing trends in the use of effective cardiac medications over time were observed in both patient groups. However, <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> significantly less likely to be treated with coronary angioplasty during the acute hospitalization. Trends of a worse long-term survival for discharged <b>Hispanic</b> patients <b>were</b> observed over a 10 -year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this community-wide study suggest encouraging hospital outcomes in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients hospitalized with AMI. Enhanced secondary prevention efforts remain needed to improve the hospital and long-term outcomes of patients with AMI, irrespective of race or ethnicity...|$|R

25|$|Most French Americans are {{believed}} descended from colonists of Catholic New France; exiled Huguenots, much fewer {{in number and}} settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. IsleÃ±os of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White <b>Hispanics</b> <b>are</b> of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.|$|E
25|$|The term Hispanic is {{cultural}} and not racial. The racial diversity found among Hispanics {{stems from the}} fact that Hispanic America has always been, since 1492, an area of immigration until late in the 20th century, when the region has increasingly become an area of emigration. Even outside the broad U.S. definition of Hispanic, the term encompasses a very racially and ethnically diverse population. While in the United States, <b>Hispanics</b> <b>are</b> often treated as a group apart from whites, blacks or other races, they actually include people who may identify with any or all of those racial groups.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, a {{percentage}} of Hispanics {{as defined by the}} U.S. government trace their ancestries to the Middle East, for example Colombians, Ecuadorians, Chileans, and Mexicans of Lebanese or Palestinian ancestry; Hispanics of Middle Eastern ancestry are usually to be considered Hispanic by the U.S. government, because they possess stereotypical Southern European appearance. Many <b>Hispanics</b> <b>are</b> of East Asian ancestry, {{as in the case of}} Cubans, Mexicans, Panamanians and Peruvians. If they were to migrate to the United States, the definition most frequently advocated would consider them Hispanic (see also: Asian Hispanic American and Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans).|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} factors {{that make it}} {{difficult}} to determine when exactly Hispanics began to serve in the Corps; one is that statistics on <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> not kept by the military until the 1970s when the United States Census Bureau coined the phrase. Before then only unreliable estimates were made. For example, during World War II <b>Hispanic</b> Americans <b>were</b> estimated to comprise 2.3% to 4.7% of the Armed Forces. However, the exact number is unknown, as at the time <b>Hispanics</b> <b>were</b> integrated into the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans. Another factor is that the estimates which have been made only take into account individuals whose surname <b>is</b> of <b>Hispanic</b> origin, when there <b>are</b> many <b>Hispanics</b> with non-Hispanic surnames who have served.|$|R
