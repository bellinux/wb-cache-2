5|$|Hartmann flew {{his first}} combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they {{encountered}} 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed {{by the idea}} of scoring his first success, opened <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, {{but by the end of}} 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.|$|E

The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gaseous fuels such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) {{have been widely used}} in commercial vehicles. In this project the main aim is to evaluate the exhaust emission by running the conventional engine on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as an alternative fuel for four-stroke spark ignition engine. The primary objective of the study is to determine the performance and the exhaust emissions of the engine using LPG as a fuel. The engine used in the study is originally a single cylinder; four-stroke spark ignition engine with certain modifications is to make to permit the experiments to run on LPG fuel. During the running, the engine was coupled to a ropeway dynamometer to measure several engine performance parameters and a 5 -gas analyzer is to be inserted into the engine exhaust tailpipe for measuring the exhaust emissions. Experimental investigations have been carried out to emissions of single cylinder four-stroke spark ignition engine at <b>full</b> <b>throttling</b> position of engine and different load conditions is used to different fuels (Gasoline and LPG).

40|$|To insure {{controllability}} of {{the baseline}} {{design for a}} 7500 pound thrust, 10 : 1 throttleable, dual expanded cycle, Hydrogen-Oxygen, orbit transfer rocket engine, an Integrated Controls and Health Monitoring concept was developed. This included: (1) Dynamic engine simulations using a TUTSIM derived computer code; (2) analysis of various control methods; (3) Failure Modes Analysis to identify critical sensors; (4) Survey of applicable sensors technology; and, (5) Study of Health Monitoring philosophies. The engine design {{was found to be}} controllable over the <b>full</b> <b>throttling</b> range by using 13 valves, including an oxygen turbine bypass valve to control mixture ratio, and a hydrogen turbine bypass valve, used in conjunction with the oxygen bypass to control thrust. Classic feedback control methods are proposed along with specific requirements for valves, sensors, and the controller. Expanding on the control system, a Health Monitoring system is proposed including suggested computing methods and the following recommended sensors: (1) Fiber optic and silicon bearing deflectometers; (2) Capacitive shaft displacement sensors; and (3) Hot spot thermocouple arrays. Further work is needed to refine and verify the dynamic simulations and control algorithms, to advance sensor capabilities, and to develop the Health Monitoring computational methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in engine {{operating}} parameters, i. e., engine speed, throttle and water temperature, for four types of diesel fuel (A, B, C and D) of different specific gravities, as supplied from local market and refineries, were studied and simultaneously optimized. The experiment design was based on Taguchi’s “L' 16 ” orthogonal table, and the engine was put to test at different engine speeds, throttling opening percentages and water temperatures, using different fuels. The {{data were analyzed using}} S/N (signal to noise ratio) for each factor. The obtained results show that the optimum operating conditions for minimum BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) are achieved when the engine speed is 2500 rpm, the throttle is placed at 75 % of <b>full</b> <b>throttling,</b> the water temperature is 80 oC and the engine is using fuel type D. Also, results of S/N ratio reveal that the throttle has significant influence on brake thermal and exergic efficiencies.

The least effective factor among the studied parameters for the types of fuel considered in this experiment is the fuel type...|$|R
5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{landing gear}} brakes, most large {{aircraft}} have {{other ways of}} decelerating. In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust forwards. On aircraft carriers, arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply <b>full</b> forward <b>throttle</b> on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.|$|R

The results indicate that at <b>full</b> open <b>throttle</b> at sea level, for the engine tested, a gain in thrust horsepower of 18 percent using separate stacks, and 9. 5 percent using a collector ring and discharge nozzle, can be expected at an air speed of 550 miles per hour...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technology}} {{advances in}} the field of ride-by-wire technology for motorcycle (namely active braking and <b>full</b> electronic <b>throttle)</b> open the way to the design of innovative control strategies to improve two-wheeled vehicles stability.

The model is derived from first principles. The model parameters are identified from a complete multi-body simulator. The proposed model offers a good tradeoff between complexity and accuracy.
