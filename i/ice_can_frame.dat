The fishing industry is the largest user of flake ice machines. Flake <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> lower the temperature of cleaning water and sea products, therefore it resists the growth of bacteria and keeps the seafood fresh.|$|R
50|$|Under certain {{conditions}} of temperature and humidity, <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's evaporator coils. The <b>ice</b> buildup <b>can</b> impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, {{and can cause}} water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.|$|R

50|$|When {{the outdoor}} {{temperature}} stays below freezing for extended periods, very thick layers of <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> form on lakes and other bodies of water, although places with flowing water require much colder temperatures.

2500|$|Off-peak {{electricity}} {{can be used}} to make {{ice from}} water, and the <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be stored. [...] The stored <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be used to cool the air in a large building which would have normally used electric AC, thereby shifting the electric load to off-peak hours. [...] On other systems stored ice is used to cool the intake air of a gas turbine generator, thus increasing the on-peak generation capacity and the on-peak efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{power of}} <b>Ice</b> <b>can</b> be the {{seen as a}} partial {{exception}} of the normal abilities of an Elemental mage. <b>Ice</b> <b>can</b> be controlled by a skilled master of Fire, with cold being the inverse of heat.

25|$|This {{refrigeration}} method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating dry ice. Perhaps {{the simplest}} {{example of this}} is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a traditional ice-cream maker).

50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> {{form on the}} Rideau Canal Skateway, which are “white ice” and “clear ice”. White ice has a milky {{appearance}} with air bubbles, and is formed when snow and water mix and then freeze. White <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> also be formed by mechanically flooding the ice surface with water to increase {{the thickness of the}} ice cap. The other type of ice is called “clear ice”, which has a colourless appearance and is formed when ice crystals build up below the frozen surface in cold temperatures. If snow accumulates on the <b>ice</b> it <b>can</b> negatively impact the conditions for skating. Snow depresses the ice surface and slows down the formation of ice crystals beneath the surface.|$|R
25|$|The extreme {{temperature}} of dry <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> cause viscoelastic materials {{to change to}} glass phase. Thus it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives.|$|R
