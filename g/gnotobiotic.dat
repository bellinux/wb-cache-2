50|$|Dr. Gordon and his {{laboratory}} are currently focused on understanding the mutualistic interactions that occur {{between humans and}} the 10-100 trillion commensal microbes that colonize each person’s gastrointestinal tract. To tease apart the complex relationships that exist within this gut micobiota, Dr. Gordon’s research program employs germ-free and <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice as model hosts, which may be colonized with defined, simplified microbial communities. These model intestinal microbiotas are more amenable to well-controlled experimentation.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, {{scientists}} believe that, {{with the aid}} of microbial engineering, the use of microbioma to modify natural or anthropogenic processes, we could change the microbiota composition of the rumen of strong methane producers, emulating the Macropodidae microbiota. Recent studies claim that this technique is possible to perform. In one of these studies scientists analyze the changes of human microbiota by different alimentary changes. In other study, researchers introduce a human microbiota in <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice in order to compare the different changes for developing new ways to manipulate the properties of the microbiota so as to prevent or treat various diseases.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1960s, Russell W. Schaedler {{isolated}} and grew bacteria from normal and SPF mice. Aerobic and less oxygen sensitive anaerobic bacteria {{are easy to}} culture. Fusiform and EOS bacteria are difficult to culture, even though they represent {{the majority of the}} normal rodent microbiota. He selected for the bacteria that dominated and can be isolated in culture, and then colonized germfree mice with different bacteria combinations. For example, one combination could include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus fecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. salivarius, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium spp., and some anaerobic fusiform bacteria. Certain defined microflora are able to restore germfree mice to resemble normal mice with reduced cecal volume, restored reproductive ability, colonization resistance, and well developed immune system. So named Schaedler flora, the defined microflora combinations was widely used in <b>gnotobiotic</b> studies.|$|E
50|$|Only mice {{have been}} colonized with ASF in experiments, since ASF {{bacteria}} originate from mice intestinal microbiome. Germfree mice are colonized by ASF {{through one of}} two methods. Pure culture of each living ASF bacteria can be grown in anaerobic conditions in laboratory setting. Lactobacilli and Bacteroides are given by gavage to germfree mice first to establish a microbial environment in the GI tract, which then supports the colonization of the spirochete and fusiform bacteria that are given later. An alternative way is to inoculate the drinking water of germfree mice with fresh feces from cecum and colon of <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice (ASF mice), {{over a period of}} four days. The establishment and concentration of each bacteria species vary slightly depending on the age, gender, and environmental conditions of the mice.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gnotobiotic</b> animals (also [...] "gnotobiotes" [...] or [...] "gnotobionts") {{are born}} in aseptic conditions, which may include removal {{from the mother}} by Caesarean section and {{immediate}} transfer of the newborn to an isolator where all incoming air, food and water is sterilized. Such animals are normally reared in a sterile or microbially-controlled laboratory environment, and they are only exposed to those microorganisms that the researchers wish to have present in the animal. These gnotobiotes are used to study the symbiotic relationships between an animal and {{one or more of}} the microorganisms that may inhabit its body. This technique is important for microbiologists because it allows them to study only a select few symbiotic interactions at a time (see Scientific control), whereas animals that develop under normal conditions may quickly acquire a microbiota that includes hundreds or thousands of unique organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Mice {{have become}} the most studied {{mammalian}} regarding their microbiomes. The gut microbiota have been studied in relation to allergic airway disease, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes. Perinatal shifting of microbiota through low dose antibiotics can have long-lasting effects on future susceptibility to allergic airway disease. The frequency of certain subsets of microbes {{has been linked to}} disease severity. The presence of specific microbes early in postnatal life, instruct future immune responses. In <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice certain gut bacteria were found to transmit a particular phenotype to recipient germ-free mice, that promoted accumulation of colonic regulatory T cells, and strains that modulated mouse adiposity and cecal metabolite concentrations. This combinatorial approach enables a systems-level understanding of microbial contributions to human biology.

5000|$|C. elegans is a {{well-established}} model organism in different research fields, yet its ecology however is only poorly understood. C. elegans were previously considered a soil-living nematode, {{but in the}} last 10 years it was shown that natural habitats of C. elegans are microbe-rich, such as compost heaps, rotten plant material, and rotten fruits. Most of the studies on C. elegans are based on the N2 strain, which has adapted to laboratory conditions. Only {{in the last few years}} the natural ecology of C. elegans has been studied in more detail and one current research focus is its interaction with microbes. As C. elegans feeds on bacteria, the intestine of worms isolated from the wild is usually filled with a large number of bacteria. In contrast to the very high diversity of bacteria in the natural habitat of C. elegans, the lab strains are only fed with one bacterial strain, the Escherichia coli derivate OP50 [...] OP50 was not co-isolated with C. elegans from nature, but was rather used because of its high convenience for laboratory maintenance. Bleaching is a common method in the laboratory to clean C. elegans of contaminations and to synchronize a population of worms. During bleaching the worms are treated with 5N NaOH and household bleach, leading to the death of all worms and survival of only the nematode eggs. The larvae hatching from these eggs lack any microbes, as none of the currently known C. elegans-associated microbes can be transferred vertically. Since most laboratory strains are kept under these <b>gnotobiotic</b> conditions, nothing is known about the composition of the C. elegans microbiota. The ecology of C. elegans can only be fully understood in the light of the multiple interactions with the microorganisms, which it encounters in the wild. The effect of microbes on C. elegans can vary from beneficial to lethal.|$|E
40|$|The <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbil was {{selected}} as a model with which to {{study the effects of}} colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in <b>gnotobiotic</b> gerbil intestines.

40|$|Cysts of Artemia franciscana were hatched and nauplii were reared under <b>gnotobiotic</b> {{conditions}} (<b>gnotobiotic</b> Artemia rearing system). Stereomicroscopy, {{computer assisted}} three-dimensional reconstruction, light microscopy, and {{transmission electron microscopy}} were used to study the structural and cellular morphology of their digestive tracts. The alimentary tract of <b>gnotobiotic</b> Artemia nauplii, fed with dead Aeromonas hydrophila and wild type strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a hooked, tubular structure which is composed of three clearly distinguishable parts, i. e. the foregut, midgut and hindgut that are freely suspended in haemolymph. The epithelium lining of the entire gut consists of a single cell layer. Enterocytes of the foregut and hindgut are cuboidal and lined by a thin cuticle, whereas midgut enterocytes are cuboidal to columnar and possess an apical brush border. The fore- and hindgut mainly display characteristics suggestive for mechanical functions, whereas the midgut shows characteristics of absorption, storage and secretion. The <b>gnotobiotic</b> Artemia rearing system is most useful to investigate the effects of micro-organisms {{on the development of}} nauplii.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether gut-derived microbial factors influence the hepatic or intestinal inflammatory response to hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R). Conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice contaminated with a defined microbiota without Gram-negative bacteria were subjected to either a sham procedure or HS/R. Tissue samples were obtained 4 h later for assessing ileal mucosal permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and hepatic and ileal mucosal steady-state IL- 6, iNOS, COX- 2 and TNF mRNA levels. Whereas HS/R significantly increased ileal mucosal permeability in conventional mice, this effect was not apparent in <b>gnotobiotic</b> animals. HS/R markedly increased hepatic mRNA levels for several pro-inflammatory genes in both conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice. HS/R increased ileal mucosal IL- 6 and COX- 2 mRNA expression in conventional but not <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice. If <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice were contaminated with Escherichia coli C 25, HS/R increased ileal mucosal permeability and up-regulated expression of IL- 6 and COX- 2.

40|$|Mosquitoes host {{communities}} of microbes in their digestive tract that consist primarily of bacteria. We previously reported that Aedes aegypti larvae colonized by a native community of bacteria and <b>gnotobiotic</b> larvae colonized by only Escherichia coli develop very similarly into adults, whereas axenic larvae never molt and die as first instars. In this study, we extended these findings by first comparing {{the growth and}} abundance of bacteria in conventional, <b>gnotobiotic,</b> and axenic larvae during the first instar. Results showed that conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> larvae exhibited no differences in growth, timing of molting, or number of bacteria in their digestive tract. Axenic larvae in contrast grew minimally and never achieved the critical size associated with molting by conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> larvae. In {{the second part of}} the study we compared patterns of gene expression in conventional, <b>gnotobiotic</b> and axenic larvae by conducting an RNAseq analysis of gut and nongut tissues (carcass) at 22 h post-hatching. Approximately 12 % of Ae. aegypti transcripts were differentially expressed in axenic versus conventional or <b>gnotobiotic</b> larvae. However, this profile consisted primarily of transcripts in seven categories that included the down-regulation of select peptidases in the gut and up-regulation of several genes in the gut and carcass with roles in amino acid transport, hormonal signaling, and metabolism.

Conventional NIH mice received daily by gavage a 0. 1 ml suspension containing about 10 (8) cfu L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 and germfree animals received a single 0. 1 ml dose. The <b>gnotobiotic</b> and conventional groups were infected orally with 10 ² and 10 (5) cfu of S. Typhimurium, respectively, 7 days after the beginning of treatment. Control groups were treated with sterile saline instead of Lactobacillus. Survival data showed a protective effect against the pathogenic bacteria in both conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> Lactobacillus-treated mice. L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 colonized the digestive tract of <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice {{and the number of}} viable cells ranged from 10 (9) to 10 (10) cfu/g of faeces. In both experimental and control <b>gnotobiotic</b> animals, S. Typhimurium became rapidly established at a level ranging from 10 (8) to 10 (10) cfu/g of faeces and remained at high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. In conclusion, the previous treatment of mice with L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 protects the animals against the experimental infection with S.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a chlamydial strain recovered from growing and finishing swine with conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis could cause the same infections in <b>gnotobiotic</b> pigs. The strain shares biological characteristics with Chlamydia trachomatis. After propagation in Vero cells and preparation of the inoculum (107 inclusion-forming units/ml), chlamydial strain H 7 was instilled into the ventral conjunctival sac (0. 15 ml/sac) of 12 anesthetized 3 -day-old <b>gnotobiotic</b> piglets. Four age-matched <b>gnotobiotic</b> piglets were anesthetized and sham infected with uninfected cell culture lysates. None of the principal piglets developed clinical symptoms of conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis.

A majority of principal piglets necropsied at 14 – 28 DPI had histologic lesions of mild conjunctivitis, but chlamydial antigen was not detected by immunohistochemistry.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of the human gut bacterial community that is recalcitrant to culture remains poorly defined.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a mutant (designated C 4) of Streptococcus mutans 6715 wild type (WT) is {{defective}} in glucosyltransferase (GTF) -synthesized insoluble glucan and is avirulent in <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats. This study investigated the factors which would render this mutant virulent in <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats. Microbial analysis of plaque from <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats (45 days old) infected with a mixture of C 4 and virulent S. mutans PS- 14 (approximately 15, 000 C 4 organisms to each S. mutans PS- 14) yielded higher numbers of C 4 organisms than S. mutans PS- 14. These animals exhibited significantly lower caries scores than did <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats (age, 45 days) monoassociated with S. mutans PS- 14. Similar mixed infection studies using C 4 and an avirulent, aggregation-defective mutant of S. mutans 6715 WT (designated UAB 165) which exhibits GTF activity {{similar to that of the}} parent strain resulted in plaque consisting almost exclusively of UAB 165 and low caries activity. However, high levels of both C 4 and UAB 165 in plaque and high caries activity were observed in <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats infected at weaning with C 4 followed by UAB 165 3 days later. When dried S. mutans 6715 WT culture supernatant containing GTF activity was mixed with diet provided rats monoassociated with C 4, significant caries activity was observed. Insoluble glucan supplemented in diet did not restore C 4 to virulence; however, admixture of suboptimal GTF-rich supernatant with insoluble glucan and C 4 resulted in high caries activity in <b>gnotobiotic</b> rats. These results suggest that in vivo restoration of pathogenesis of a GTF-defective mutant of S. mutans can be achieved either by complementation with a mutant defective in aggregation properties or by providing exogenous GTF and glucan from the parent S. mutans 6715 WT...|$|E
40|$|Viable {{bacteria}} {{were not}} cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice.

These indigenous E. coli also were cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 96 % of <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice monoassociated with E. coli but from none of the mesenteric lymph nodes of SPF mice inoculated with the E. coli. Furthermore, viable E. coli were detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of these monoassociated gnotobiotes for as long as 112 days after inoculation. Indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus also translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice monoassociated with L. acidophilus. Apparently, there are mechanisms active in SPF mice inhibiting translocation of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers, whereas these mechanisms are either absent or reduced in <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice. Indigenous E. coli maintained higher population levels in the gastrointestinal tracts of the gnotobiotes compared with their population levels in SPF mice, suggesting that high bacterial population levels might promote translocation of certain bacteria from the gastrointestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes. <b>Gnotobiotic</b> and SPF mice, therefore, provide experimental models for determining the nature of the mechanisms operating to confine indigenous bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract in normal, healthy animals...|$|E

Propagation of four different antigenic types of RNA phages was tested. No detectable propagation or colonization of RNA phages was observed either in germfree mice or in <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice infected with the F- strain of Escherichia coli. Propagation or colonization was observed when RNA phages were orally introduced into <b>gnotobiotic</b> mice harboring the F+ or F' strain of E. coli.
