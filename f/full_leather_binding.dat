50|$|The best of Sandgren's {{bindings}} are in {{a simple}} and timeless design. On his famous <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> <b>bindings,</b> of which he made around 100, the decoration {{is limited to a}} gilt frame near the edges of the sides - e.g. a gilt line, pattern or geometric design - and the large central area of the sides are free from decoration, so the quality and colour of the leather is in focus. Sandgren only used the very best in goatskin or Morocco leather with a beautiful, natural structure, and his bindings are in subdued, darker colours, for example brown or red. His principle is not unlike the Danish furniture designers, like Hans Wegner, where the natural colors, textures and flexibility of the wood are highlighted in their furniture.August Sandgren only used a small number of stamps to decorate the spines of the bindings, but he used them with great variety. He used marbled sidepaper, handmade by himself, and they were kept in darker colors - brown, black, dark green and blue, and the most beautiful paper has vertical, dense stripes.|$|R

The first page of text has a wide frame with hand-colored foliate decoration. The first word is illuminated in gilded capitals on a large field of blue, red and gold paint.

Frames and beginnings of sections are decorated with blue and red dots of paint. Predominant colors in illuminations are blue, red, and green. Iron gall ink in heavily ruled borders has "rusted" through a number of leaves. Two leaves of illuminated miniatures on vellum are bound in at front with illustrations facing. The first leaf has two half-page miniatures. The upper illustration shows Mary with the Christ Child surrounded by clouds over a landscape.

The full-page miniature is a full-length portrait of the Martínez family patriarch, Ferrán Martínez, in full armor and with eyes fixed on the family coat of arms.
