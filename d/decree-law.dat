The urban planner Jorge de Macedo Vieira was chosen to integrate the use of space with the mineral waters, topography, soil, and climate, conducting a two-year-long detailed study of the area prior to designing the city.

The discrepancy appearing during the 1880 ’s- 1890 ’s is less related to repression than to legal order. Immigration becomes a question strictly related to the sovereign power and falls under the administration’s jurisdiction only, without any legal guarantees. This gradual empowerment of foreigners as a legal category, following a process neither unquestioned nor linear, finally leads to the 1938 <b>decree-laws.</b> These <b>decree-laws</b> designed a worsened repressive regime towards foreigners deemed “undesirable” and therefore created a specific law for foreigners which is not being derogatory from the common law in the strict sense of the term but could be labelled as an “exceptional common law”.
