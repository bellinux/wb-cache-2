40|$|Parameters, such as oil, protein, glucosinolates, {{chlorophyll}} {{content and}} fatty acid composition, were determined using reference methods for both harvest survey samples and Canadian Canola exports. Canola harvest survey and export data were assessed to evaluate if canola harvest survey {{data can be}} extrapolated to predict {{the quality of the}} Canadian canola exports. There were some differences in some measured parameters between <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> data, while other parameters showed little difference. Protein content and fatty acid composition showed very similar data for <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> averages. Canadian export data showed lower oil content when compared to the oil content of harvest survey was mainly due to a diluting effect of dockage in the export cargoes which remained constant over the years (1. 7 % to 1. 9 %). Chlorophyll was the least predictable parameter; dockage quality as well as commingling of the other grades in Canola No. 1 Canada affected the chlorophyll content of the exports. Free fatty acids (FFA) were also different for the export and harvest survey. FFA levels are affected by storage conditions; they increase during the shipping season and, therefore, are difficult to predict from their harvest survey averages...|$|E

TAP families either do petty contracts like middlemen in handling the fruits or transporting them from remote orchards to the road head, or women and girls engage in packing the fruits in the boxes. These activities form one of the main cash income opportunities for TAP families in winter for those that migrate far down enough to reach orange-growing areas. Those that do not go that far engage in making baskets and other cane products, mainly for their domestic consumption. However, irrespective of the amount of income they earned seasonally or crops harvested from their fields, nearly 90 % of herders rated cattle as important to highly important for their household’s livelihood.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{commercial}} trade in three reptile species harvested for different purposes in western Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) for international markets: (1) Tokay geckos, Gekko gecko, traded for medicinal uses, (2) Javan filesnakes, Acrochordus javanicus, harvested for skins, and (3) Asiatic softshell turtles, Amyda cartilaginea, harvested for meat; each species is also exploited for the pet trade, but to a lesser extent. All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, {{but there is a}} national <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the quota allocated by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1. 2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the national quota of 50, 000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD / year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005 – 6) was estimated at around 300, 000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30, 000 from Sumatra, exceeding the national quota of 200, 000 individuals / year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD / year.

The initial focus is on Essential Climate Variables identified by the Global Climate Observing System CH 4, CO, CO 2, NO 2, O 3, SO 2 and aerosols. This poster addresses our efforts in building the ACP Data Table, an interface to help discover and understand remotely sensed data {{that are related to}} atmospheric composition science and applications. We harvested GCMD, CWIC, GEOSS metadata catalogs using machine to machine technologies - OpenSearch, Web Services. We also manually investigated the plethora of CEOS data providers portals and other catalogs where that data might be aggregated. This poster is our experience of the excellence, variety, and challenges we encountered. Conclusions: 1. The significant benefits that the major catalogs provide are their machine to machine tools like OpenSearch and Web Services rather than any GUI usability improvements due to the large amount of data in their catalog. 2. There is a trend at the large catalogs towards simulating small data provider portals through advanced services. 3. Populating metadata catalogs using ISO 19115 is too complex for users to do in a consistent way, difficult to parse visually or with XML libraries, and too complex for Java XML binders like CASTOR. 4. The ability to search for Ids first and then for data (GCMD and ECHO) is better for machine to machine operations rather than the timeouts experienced when returning the entire metadata entry at once. 5.

40|$|The Kazakhstan, with export {{capacity}} of 6 – 8 million tons, {{is one of}} the largest wheat exporter in the world. About 16 million hectares of unirrigated land is used for monocultural cultivation of cereals (wheat and barley). Most of the cropland is located in the steppe and forest steppe zone. The moisture deficit limits the crop productivity and creates a strong dependency of its state of the moisture conditions during vegetation season. In Kazakhstan, the average grain yield variations are sufficiently large, from 0. 9 (2010) to 1. 4 ton (2007). Given the high volatility of the gross grain <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> potential, respectively, methods of early satellite forecast of grain yield with high frequency of the renewal are of the great interest. In Kazakhstan, the variations in the weather growing season determine the yield of grain crops. By significant weather parameters include: the spring soil moisture, humidity and air temperature, rainfall, and several others. Plants respond to the sum of all parameters through the volume of green biomass. The regional cereal state can be estimated from satellite vegetation indices, which are particularly informative in the period of its seasonal peak. Another satellite parameter closely related to humidity conditions may be the land surface temperature (LST). Product USGS: TERRA MOD 11 A 2 DAY represents the 8 -days LST composite was tested in the task of estimating of arable lands temperature in Northern Kazakhstan. The description of the temperature conditions of the growing season based on the temperature calibrated index (TCI), which was introduced by Kogan. TCI provides a weighted assessment of the current LST on a scale of 0 - 100, where 0 - the lowest, respectively, 100 as a high temperature, recorded during the observation period at a given location at a given time window. The monitoring period included 2004 – 2010 years. During the beginning of the growing season was taken on April 15, season end on 20 August – ripeness stage of wheat. It was analyzed the two largest agriculture provinces – Akmola and Kostanay with a total cropland size is about 9 million hectares. The size of cultivated areas in Akmola and Kostanay areas during 2004 – 2010 has undergone a substantial increase, from 6. 7 million hectares in 2004 to 8. 9 million hectares in 2010. The temperature regime characterized by a weather component, and not depend on the land use type. Therefore, for the diagnosis of arable land in the period 2004 – 2010 was used a fixed mask, covering most major crop areas. Description of the temperature regime of arable land during the growing season (April 15 –August 20) has the form of TCI time series which consists of 15 values (8 day period of renewal). The time window of each of the 15 assessments began on April 15 and ended up floating-date with progressive increments in 8 days. Accordingly, the last value of TCI, reflecting a weighted temperature throughout the analyzed part of the growing season (April 15 -August 20). last value of TCI has a good correlation with the official cereal yield, R 2 = 0, 98 for Akmola, R 2 = 0, 90 for Kostanay oblast. These values are higher than the correlation between seasonal maximum NDVI (TERRA MOD 13 Q 1, 187 - 203 days) and yield of grain crops, which accounted for R 2 = 0, 85 Akmola, and R 2 = 0, 73 for Kostanay oblast. Scheme of the operative forecast grain yields was based on estimates of the temperature dynamics of arable land current year in comparison with the conditions of the past ones. The closest temperature regimes of previous years, in linear proportion to the degree of closeness to the current year, created a synthetic year-analogue. Yield, the year-analogue consisted of proportionate share of the yield components of its past. The magnitude of this yield, calculated as 15 times a season, forms the operational forecast with 8 -day period of renewal. Thus, the TCI based on TERRA / MOD 11 A 2 DAY on informative in assessing the ceeral condition in Northern Kazakhstan is not inferior TERRA / MOD 13 Q 1 / NDVI. Due to variations in sowing date assessment of culture-based vegetation index at the regional scale is difficult in the first half of the growing season, when there is a significant increase in the values of NDVI. LST is not directly connected with the agriculture cultivation techniques. This allows you to weigh the weather conditions and build the scheme of early operational forecasting crop yields with a high renewal rate when there is a close relationship between the temperature regime of arable land and crops condition...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the crucial}} issues of our decades is how to stop the loss of biodiversity. Policy–makers need {{reliable}} data to base their decisions on. Managing wildlife populations requires, first of all, science–based knowledge of their abundance, dynamics, ecology, behaviour and dispersal capacities based on reliable qualitative data. The importance of dialogue and communication with the local actors should be stressed (Sennerby Forsse, 2010) as bag statistics and other monitoring data in wildlife management could be more precise if local actors, notably hunters, were better informed and aware of their importance, especially in supporting existing and emerging policies at national and international levels. Another essential issue in wildlife management is the conflicts generated by humans and their activities when they interact with wildlife (Heredia & Bass, 2011). A sociologic approach is required {{to take into account}} those human groups whose interests are divergent, facilitating communication and collaborative learning among these users of the same ecosytem. Obstacles should be addressed and solutions devised to protect and encourage a sustainable use of this ecosystem in, as much as possible, a win–win relationship. Policy objectives and management strategies should be discussed and debated among the stakeholders involved, then formulated. Policies can be translated into different types of instruments, economic and legislative, but also informative and educative. As awareness of the actors is a key factor of successful regulation, the regulations should be sufficiently explained and stakeholders should be involved in the implementation of these regulations as much as possible. Finally, the effectiveness of the regulations should be evaluated in light of their objectives, and where necessary, the regulations should be strengthened or adapted to improve their performance (Van Gossum et al., 2010). The various aspects of the processes described above were highlighted in the plenary talk and the five oral communications presented during the session on wildlife law and policy. In his plenary talk, Dr Borja Heredia, Head of the Scientific Unit of the Secretariat of the CMS/UNEP in Bonn, pointed out different sources of human–wildlife conflicts, such as the logging activities in subtropical forests that induce overexploitation and poaching for bushmeat consumption; the problem of predators on livestock and the poisoning of lions in the Masaï Reserve; animals invading the human territory; and game species as a vector of diseases in humans and livestock (Heredia & Bass, 2011). Heredia stressed the importance for wildlife managers to deal with the human dimension; he stressed the importance of successful conflict management based on principles such as a non–adversial framework, an analytical approach, a problem–solving orientation, the direct participation of the conflicting parties, dialogue as a basis for mutual understanding and facilitation by a trained third party. Heredia explained how the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (UNEP/CMS) contributes to confict resolution and in this way increases the chance of survival of these species. The CMS (see CMS website) works for the conservation of a wide array of endangered migratory animals worldwide through the negotiation and implementation of agreements and action plans. Migratory species threatened with extinction are listed in Appendix I of the Convention. CMS parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. Besides establishing obligations for each State joining the CMS, CMS promotes concerted action among the Range States of many of these species. Migratory species that need, or would significantly benefit from, international co–operation are listed in Appendix II of the Convention. For this reason, the Convention encourages the Range states to reach global or regional agreements. The Convention acts, in this respect as a framework convention. The Agreements may range from legally binding treaties (called agreements, there are seven) to less formal instruments, such as Memoranda of Understanding, or actions plans (there are 20), and they can be adapted to the requirements of particular regions. The development of models tailored according to the conservation needs throughout the migratory range is a unique capacity to CMS. Heredia detailed inter alia the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, the Great Apes Survival Partnership, the Agreement on the Conservation of Gorillas and their Habitats, the MoU on the Saïga Antelope, and the Programme for the Conservation and sustainable use of the wild saker falcon (Falco cherrug) in Mongolia. The talk of Sarah Wilks, research fellow at the School of Law, University of Western Sydney, illustrated the importance of adequate transparency and public consultation in environmental and conservation law and decision making. Wilks (2012) examined the Australian legislation concerning animal welfare and the export of Australian wildlife products and, as a case study, explored the Tasmanian State Government’s recent decision to promote the commercial <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> of brushtail possums. She pointed out that although the Enviromment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 1999 (EPBC) process intended to be open and co–operative, it is not, in practice, co–operative, public and transparent. The export of possum products requires Australian Government approval under the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (EPBC). Wilks (2012) assessed the Tasmanian Wildlife Trade Management Plan for Common Brushtail Possums developed by the EPBC, the public submissions to the Australian Government, and the Australian Government’s response against the provisions of the EPBC. As a result, she deplored that welfare outcomes, like that of back or pouch juveniles whose mother had been trapped or killed have not been adequately considered either at Tasmanian State or at Australian Govenment level. She concluded by deploring that submissions on ethical grounds could not yet be considered by the Australian Government because the decision to harvest or not to harvest is made at State level, and yet the Tasmanian State legislation is deficient in mandating public consultation. Data on hunting and game resources provide quantitative and qualitative information on game species, but moreover, game monitoring has shown to be efficient in identifying threats to biodiversity, such as biodiversity problems in agriculture and forest ecosystems, and also to be an early warning in assessing threats from invasive alien species (Sennerby Forsse, 2010). They are an essential tool for game managers, scientists and policy–makers, and hunters and hunter organisations are key resources in the collection of this information. The ARTEMIS data bank was initiated by the Federation of Asssociations of Hunting and Conservation of the European Union FACE (see ARTEMIS website) to improve information about game in support of existing and emerging European policies. The objective of ARTEMIS is to centralise and analyse, in a coordinated and coherent way, the information on hunting bags already collected in many European countries and to complete them with new data following a common methodology. As a second step, the Conference on Game Monitoring held in Uppsala, Sweden, in December 2009, aimed to propose further actions to promote streamlined European game monitoring in support of wildlife and biodiversity policies (Sennerby Forsse, 2010). In this context, Martinez–Jauregui & Herruzo (2011) presented data concerning the Spanish hunting statistics collected from 1972 to 2007. Data related to hunters, hunting grounds and game animals were analysed to determine their strengths and weaknesses, and results showed that official Spanish statistics could be incomplete, disperse, and not always homogeneous {{over a long period of}} time. The authors concluded that there is a need in the current process to agree on a common international protocol to collect hunting statistics, and they suggested going beyond hunting data to consider other aspects of the hunting sector and reduce the gap between hunting and other agricultural and forest resources. Jutta Gerner, from the Institute of Forest and Environmental Policy at the University of Freiburg, Germany, investigated the shortcomings of the current regulatory practices with regards to hunting regulations in protected areas in order to improve administrative efficiency. Gerner & Schraml (2011), analysed 800 administrative acts and 26 qualitative interviews based on the regulatory arrangement approach (RAA). The RAA is a policy instrument choice theory which helps regulators find the most appropriate instruments by measuring and evaluating them. Van Gossum et al. (2010) developed the RAA by merging current smart regulation theory with the policy arrangement approach and the policy learning concept. Gerner & Schraml (2011) suggested the integration of a more cooperative, less 'regulator' and more informative policy style in hunting regulations. They recommended better communication and information among the concerned administrative sections and between administration and local actors in order to improve policy success. They recommended that the different stakeholders should be informed and involved when debating policy objectives and strategies, as well as in the application of the administrative acts. The study presented by R. Mateo from the 'Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos', IREC (CSIC, UCLM, JCCM), Spain, was an example of a rigorous follow–up of a regulation objective, followed by a reinforcement and adaptation of the regulation to improve its performance. Results of Mateo et al. (2011) showed that, although the use of lead shot was banned in protected wetlands in Spain in 2001, ban compliance was insufficient, as in 2007 – 2008 a large number of waterfowl hunted in wetland still had embedded lead shot. After these results were produced, the ban was reinforced and compliance subsequently increased. Nevertheless, in 2009 – 2010, the last year of this study, a significant proportion of birds still had embedded lead shot and /or ingested lead shot in their gizzards. The authors suggested this occurred because the majority of ducks often feed in unprotected rice fields. They therefore recommended extending the ban to all waterfowl hunting and not only that undertaken in protected wetlands. The presentation of K. E. Skordas, from the Hunting Federation of Macedonia and Thrace, Research Division, Greece, illustrated the contribution of the Hellenic Hunters Confederation (HHC) to law enforcement for wildlife protection. It showed how stakeholders, hunters, set up heir own Game Warden Service in 1999, through their Hunting Associations, in order to assume responsibility for the control of illegal hunting and wildlife protection, in collaboration with the local Forest Service. These game wardens carry out repressive and preventive controls and prosecutions. Besides this initiative, information campaigns are organised by the HHC to improve hunters’ awareness (see website of the Hellenic Hunters Confederation, HHC). Skordas & Papaspyropoulos (2011) analysed the relation between law enforcement, hunter awareness and infringement categories, classed in degree of influencing wildlife protection. They observed a strong reduction in the number of infringements; particularly, they found that hunting out of season and hunting without a license decreased from 23. 4 % to 7. 31 % and from 30. 12 % to 11. 8 %, respectively. All the talks presented in this session stressed the importance of dialogue in wildlife management as a basis for mutual understanding. Communication and involvement of the local actors/stakeholders are key factors at different stages of wildlife management: when collecting reliable data on which policy–makers may draw up their decisions, when debating policy objectives and strategies, and when implementing regulations and administrative acts.

50|$|The island gets much of {{its water}} from three {{catchments}} set {{on the east side}} of the island. One serves the resort at Saltwhistle Bay and two serve the village. Saline Bay is named for the salt pond just east of the sandy beach. Salt was <b>harvested</b> <b>and</b> <b>exported</b> in times past but is now harvested only for local use. The island is populated mostly by fishermen and supported by tourism. The school has about 50 students from kindergarten to Grades 6. Upon completing their primary/elementary education, students attend secondary schools on neighbouring Union Island or the main island, St. Vincent. Mayreau also has a small resort area on Saltwhistle Bay, a very popular spot for anchoring yachts.|$|R
50|$|Until 1850, natural BNF, cultivation-induced BNF (e.g., {{planting}} of leguminous crops), and incorporated organic matter {{were the only}} sources of N for agricultural production. Near {{the turn of the}} century, Nr from guano and sodium nitrate deposits was <b>harvested</b> <b>and</b> <b>exported</b> from the arid Pacific islands and South American deserts. By the late 1920s, early industrial processes, albeit inefficient, were commonly used to produce NH3. Due to the efforts of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, the Haber-Bosch process became the largest source of nitrogenous fertilizer after the 1950s, and replaced BNF as the dominant source of NH3 production. From 1890 to 1990, anthropogenically created Nr increased almost ninefold. During this time, mango population more than tripled, partly due to increased food production.|$|R

2500|$|Casement {{joined the}} Colonial Service, under the {{authority}} of the Colonial Office, first serving overseas as a clerk in British West Africa [...] before in August 1901 transferring to the Foreign Office service as British consul {{in the eastern part of}} the French Congo. In 1903 the British government commissioned Casement, then its consul at Boma in the Congo Free State, to investigate the human rights situation in that colony of the Belgian king, Leopold II. Setting up a private army known as the Force Publique, Leopold had squeezed revenue out of the people of the territory through a reign of terror in the <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> of rubber <b>and</b> other resources. In trade, Belgium shipped guns, whips (cocote) and other materials to the Congo, used chiefly to suppress the local people.|$|R

40|$|Over 70 % of China's timber product imports are {{supplied}} by {{countries in the}} Asia Pacific region, and China is the dominant forest product market {{for many of these}} countries. Unsustainable harvesting practices, illegal logging, and negative impacts on community livelihoods plague many of these supplying countries. The countries may be divided into those still <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exporting</b> timber from natural forests on a large scale and those which have gone past their highest levels of natural forest timber <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> are now more aggressively pursuing plantation development and processing. Apart from Russia, China's top Asia Pacific timber suppliers could at best maintain current supply, with natural forest resources being depleted in less than 20 years. Resource limits also constrain expansion and/or long-term continuation of processed product export to China. Greater attention and action on the part of governments, market leaders, and international organizations is needed to address negative impacts, shifting supply to a sustainable, legal, and equitable basis and to determine from where China's long-term supply will come...|$|R
30|$|It is {{estimated}} that 66 sea cucumber species are caught from more than 40 countries <b>and</b> <b>exported</b> to Asian markets (Conand and Byrne 1993; Choo 2008; Conand 2008; Kinch et al. 2008; Purcell 2010; Purcell et al. 2012). There {{has been a significant}} reduction in the sea cucumber stocks in many countries, or even a complete stock depletion in many tropical fisheries caused by the increasing market demand, unrestrained exploitation and/or inadequate fisheries (Purcell et al. 2012). Those situations boosted the catch and commercialization of species from alternative locations such as the Mediterranean Sea, being Holothuria mammata, H. tubulosa and H. polii some of the new target species (Aydin 2008; Aydin et al. 2011; González-Wangüemert et al. 2014; González-Wangüemert et al. 2016, 2018; González-Wangüemert and Domínguez-Godino 2016). Turkey is the main Mediterranean country actively <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exporting</b> sea cucumbers to Asian countries, including H. mammata, H. polii, H. tubulosa and H. sanctori (Çakli et al. 2004; Aydin 2008; González-Wangüemert et al. 2014; González-Wangüemert et al. 2015, 2016, 2018).|$|R
