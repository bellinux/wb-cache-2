5|$|The Dallas Cowboys and the Steelers <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{scoreless}} in {{the first}} quarter. Troy Polamalu intercepted a pass in his fourth consecutive game, overall he led the league with seven interceptions. The Steelers scored first on a 24-yard field goal from Jeff Reed with 2:44 remaining in the second quarter. The Cowboys converted a 44-yard field goal as time expired on the first half {{to tie the game}} at 3–3.|$|E
25|$|The waltz (El vals) {{arrived in}} Cuba by 1814. It {{was the first}} dance in which couples were not linked by a {{communal}} sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first beat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its relative popularity in 19th-century Cuba is hard to estimate.|$|E
500|$|As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive {{approach}} {{was the opposite}} of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman [...] "probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom {{and listened to the}} beating of her heart." [...] Despite their different approaches, the two writers <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he [...] "reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart {{as well as of the}} mind... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". Colin Davis highlighted [...] "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.|$|E
60|$|There was a shuddering pause. All {{the gentlemen}} except Dr. Woodford, who feared the chill, descended again. Mrs. Oakshott and Anne <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands and trembled.|$|R
60|$|For a space they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands, {{studying}} <b>each</b> the <b>other's</b> face. And {{many times}} {{after they had}} parted, she looked back half doubtfully at him, standing still {{in the place where}} they had met....|$|R
6000|$|Hetty obeyed Dinah's movement, {{and sank}} on her knees. They still <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands, {{and there was}} long silence. Then Dinah said, [...] "Hetty, we are before God. He is {{waiting for you to}} tell the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|The two drivers <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{apart at}} arm's length, and fell limply {{together}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{the hell}} didn't {{you tell a}} feller?" [...] reproachfully growled the Arizonian. Frank and Jim <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> upright, {{and the rest of}} us gave way to as hearty if not as violent mirth.|$|E
60|$|Francesco stirred, and a sigh fluttered {{through his}} pallid lips. Then {{he raised his}} heavy lids, and their glances met and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> And so, eyes that were brown and tender looked down into feverish languid eyes of black, what time her gentle hand held the moist cloth to his aching brow.|$|E
60|$|They <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> {{hand and}} jumped, {{alighting}} safely in the roadway. Then, fearing their mothers would see them, Humpty ran {{as fast as}} he could go until he and Coutchie were concealed beneath a rosebush in the garden.|$|R
60|$|They <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands {{while she}} spoke, and both {{looked at their}} imaged selves. But the reality was far more beautiful; she all lily-white and golden, and he with his dark glowing beauty above the purple red-bordered tunic.|$|R
60|$|Across {{the length}} of that hall our eyes met--hers and mine--and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> glances. To me the room and all within it formed an indistinct and misty picture, from out of which there clearly gleamed my Paola's sweet, white face.|$|R
6000|$|Then they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{a moment}} in a silent embrace, like two sisters; and {{afterwards}} Pansy walked along the corridor with her visitor {{to the top of}} the staircase. [...] "Madame Merle has been here," [...] she remarked as they went; and as Isabel answered nothing she added abruptly: [...] "I don't like Madame Merle!" ...|$|E
60|$|The cruel {{time had}} come. They made their last promises; shared their last kisses; <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in the last}} embrace. She threw herself on the sofa, as he left her--with a gesture which entreated him to go, while she could still control herself. Once, he looked round, {{when he reached the}} door--and then it was over.|$|E
60|$|They heard Todd shamble {{along the}} hall. They wriggled with {{concealed}} laughter and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> tighter {{when he stopped}} {{at the door of the}} flat and blew his nervous nose in a tremendous blast.... More vulgar possibly than the trumpetry which heralded the arrival of Lancelot at a château, but on the whole quite as effective.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{peoples to}} cease any animosities <b>held</b> against <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{stood on}} the rear {{platform}} and waved to them as the train pulled out. Rilla was standing by herself, but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> cold hands as the train rounded {{the curve of the}} wooded hill.|$|R
6000|$|CURTIS--[Frightenedly.] Martha! Stop! This is terrible! [They {{continue}} to be <b>held</b> by <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> fearfully questioning eyes.] ...|$|R
60|$|Most threw {{themselves}} {{at his feet}} with weeping and entreaty; some one or two slunk in confusion from the apartment, and were heard riding off. Unnoticed in such a scene, Darsie, his sister, and Fairford, drew together, and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by the hands, as those who, when a vessel is about to founder in the storm, determine to take their chance {{of life and death}} together.|$|E
60|$|What {{they were}} to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When {{they went back to}} be kissed and cuddled by {{faithful}} Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, Nehushta, Miriam and {{the steward}} Stephanus, {{disguised}} as a slave, went on as swiftly as they dared towards the palace of Marcus in the Via Agrippa. The two women <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by the hand but said nothing; their hearts seemed too full for speech. Only the old steward kept muttering--"Two thousand sestertia! The savings of years! Two thousand sestertia for that bit of a girl! Surely the gods have smitten him mad." ...|$|E
60|$|The ladies! Yes, {{and their}} friends, the men. There was a Tommy society in Mayfair that winter, {{nearly all of}} the members eminent or beautiful, and they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands. Both sexes were eligible, married or single, and the one rule was {{something}} about sympathy. It afterwards became the Souls, but those in the know still call them the Tommies.|$|R
60|$|They always {{sat alone}} {{together}} in the big pew, and Alma Spencer, who sat behind them, declared that they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands all through the service. This lasted until spring; then came a sensation and scandal, such as decorous Heatherton had not known since the time Isaac Allen got drunk at Centreville Fair and came home and kicked his wife.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Arbuton's valise {{was sent}} for at night from the Hôtel St. Louis, {{and they did}} not see him again. When Kitty woke next morning, a fine cold rain was falling upon the {{drooping}} hollyhocks in the Ursulines' Garden, which seemed stricken through every leaf and flower with sudden autumn. All the forenoon the garden-paths remained empty, but under the porch by the poplars sat the slender nun and the stout nun side by side, and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands. They did not move, they did not appear to speak.|$|R
6000|$|Even Fanny {{was driven}} beyond the {{strength}} of her composure by the strangeness of this advent. [...] "Carry! Carry!" [...] she exclaimed over and over again, not aloud,--and indeed her voice was never loud,--but with bated wonder. The two sisters <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by the hand, and Carry's other hand still grasped her mother's arm. [...] "Oh, mother, I am so tired," [...] said the girl. [...] "Oh, mother, I think that I shall die." ...|$|E
6000|$|He had various folios of reproductions, {{and among}} them a cheap print from Fra Angelico's [...] "Entry of the Blessed into Paradise". This filled Anna with bliss. The beautiful, {{innocent}} {{way in which the}} Blessed <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by the hand as they moved towards the radiance, the real, real, angelic melody, made her weep with happiness. The floweriness, the beams of light, the linking of hands, was almost too much for her, too innocent.|$|E
60|$|The tangled brush had {{vanished}} and wet ashes covered the ground. Half-burned logs lay about, and {{here and there}} small trees, leaning at sharp angles with blackened branches locked, <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> up. In places, big charred rampikes stood in rows like colonnades. The nearer rows looked black; farther off they shone in the rain with a curious silver gleam. The fire had helped to clear the ground, but wet men were at work with axes and saws.|$|E
60|$|Poor children! while Sir James Stewart {{was in the}} Prior's chamber, {{they sat}} silent and mournful by the bedside where their {{guardian}} lay dozing, even till the bell for Matins summoned them in common {{with all the other}} inmates of the convent; they knelt {{on the floor of the}} candle-lit church, and <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands as they prayed; Lilias still the stronger and more hopeful, while Malcolm, as he looked up at those dear familiar vaultings, felt as if he were a bird driven from its calm peaceful nest to battle with the tossing winds and storms of ocean, without one near him whom he had learnt to love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Carmen" [...] fascinated them both. The gaudy, {{careless}} Southern life amazed them. The bold free way {{in which}} Carmen played with life startled them with hints of freedom. They stared on the stage fascinated. Between the acts they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands, and looked full into <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> wide bright eyes, and, laughing with excitement, talked about the opera. The theatre surged and roared dimly like a hoarse shell. Then the music rose like a storm, and swept and rattled at their feet. On the stage the strange storm of life clashed in music towards tragedy and futile death. The two were shaken with a tumult of wild feeling. When {{it was all over}} they rose bewildered, stunned, she with tears in her eyes, he with a strange wild beating of his heart.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presidents and}} vice {{presidents of the}} {{assembly}} were chosen for one week, thus continuously changing. The presidents were: Peder Anker (10-17 April), Diderik Hegermann (18-24 April), Jens Schou Fabricius (25 April-1 May), Christian Adolph Diriks (2-8 May), Christian Magnus Falsen (9-16 May) and Georg Sverdrup (17-20 May). Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie was the assembly's permanent secretary. The Assembly agreed upon {{the text of the}} Constitution on 17 May 1814. Sverdrup, who was the last president, gave the final speech. The Constitution was signed and dated 18 May 1814, but the 17th of May is today celebrated as the Norwegian National Day. The members said farewell on 20 May, when they <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands saying [...] "United and loyal until the mountains of Dovre crumble!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I will;" [...] {{and when}} Aunt Jo was gone, little Demi got up quietly, dressed {{as if in}} a dream, and leaving Tommy fast asleep went away through the silent house, feeling that {{something}} new and sorrowful was going to happen something that set him apart from the other boys for a time, and made the world seem as dark and still and strange as those familiar rooms did in the night. A carriage sent by Mr. Laurie stood before the door. Daisy was soon ready, and the brother and sister <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by the hand all the way into town, as they drove swiftly and silently with aunt and uncle through the shadowy roads to say good-by to father.|$|E
6000|$|There, in a dim {{corner where}} the {{moonlight}} and the passing clouds threw deep shadows, I saw her, clothed as ever in her shroud. Why, I know not. I felt somehow {{that the situation}} was even more serious than ever. But I was steeled to whatever might come. My mind had been already made up. To carry out my resolve to win the woman I loved I was ready to face death. But now, after we had for a few brief moments <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in our arms, I was willing to accept death--or more than death. Now, more than before, was she sweet and dear to me. Whatever qualms {{there might have been}} at the beginning of our love-making, or during the progress of it, did not now exist. We had exchanged vows and confidences, and acknowledged our loves. What, then, could there be of distrust, or even doubt, that the present might not set at naught? But even had there been such doubts or qualms, they must have disappeared in the ardour of our mutual embrace. I was by now mad for her, and was content to be so mad. When she had breath to speak after the strictness of our embrace, she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Claude {{stood and}} looked at her a moment; he shook his head slowly, {{altogether}} tenderly. [...] "I've already admitted it--I'm in mortal terror; so we'll let that settle the question. I think you had best go to bed," [...] he added; [...] "you've had a tremendous day and you must both be tired to death. I shall not expect you to concern yourselves in the morning with my movements. There's an early boat on; I shall have cleared out before you're up; and I shall moreover have dealt directly and most effectively, I assure you, with the haughty but not quite hopeless Miss Ash." [...] He turned to his stepdaughter as if at once to take leave of her and give her a sign of how, through all tension and friction, they were still united {{in such a way that}} she at least needn't worry. [...] "Maisie boy!"--he opened his arms to her. With her culpable lightness she flew into them and, while he kissed her, chose the soft method of silence to satisfy him, the silence that after battles of talk was the best balm she could offer his wounds. They <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> long enough to reaffirm intensely their vows; after which they were almost forced apart by Mrs. Wix's jumping to her feet.|$|E
60|$|The rain {{increased}} in violence, appalling {{even those who}} heard it from under cover. However rain may storm, though it be an army of archers battering roofs and windows, it is only terrifying when the noise swells every instant. In those hours of darkness {{it again and again}} grew in force and doubled its fury, and was louder, louder, and louder, until its next attack was to be more than men and women could listen to. They <b>held</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hands and stood waiting. Then abruptly it abated, and people could speak. I believe a rain that became heavier every second for ten minutes would drive many listeners mad. Gavin was in it on a night that tried us repeatedly for quite half that time.|$|R
50|$|Brokartök Glíma is the {{national}} sport of Iceland. The oldest Icelandic competition in glima is Skjaldarglíma Ármann which was first held in 1888 and has been held almost every year since. In 1905 the belt was introduced so that the wrestlers could have a better grip on <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Before that they <b>held</b> on <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> trousers. In 1906 the first Íslandsglíman (Grettisbeltið) competition was held where the winners are named Glímukóngur.|$|R
