25|$|Upon his re-election, Wallace {{indicated}} {{his intention}} to undertake a three-month review the club's business operations and it was revealed this included cuts to the first-team wage budget. The Rangers manager signed off on a wage reduction on 11 January, {{the same day as}} the club hired Philip Nash as a <b>financial</b> <b>consultant</b> to assist with the business review. Following this the club unsuccessfully asked the first-team squad to take pay cuts of around 15% until summer 2015 and as greater scrutiny was focused on the club's finances, Rangers financial director Brian Stockbridge resigned on 24 January. Indeed, in early February Wallace was forced to deny claims that the club was {{on the brink of a}} second insolvency event, however, two-weeks later Rangers borrowed £1.5m from shareholders Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners for working capital. The loan agreement was widely criticised, as Laxey Partners stood to make £150,000 in either interest or shares by the time it was repaid and also the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House were being used as security. Despite this, prior to his court case, former director Imran Ahmad has failed to ring-fence cash at the club ahead of his now £500,000 lawsuit.|$|E

500|$|Kiep {{served as}} federal {{treasurer}} of the CDU from 1971 to 1992. During his tenure, the party was involved in several financial scandals. Shortly after taking over, Kiep brought in economist Uwe Lüthje as general agent and public accountant Horst Weyrauch as a <b>financial</b> <b>consultant.</b> Together, the three started an elaborate system aimed at accumulating funding for the party. The Staatsbürgerliche Vereinigung 1954 e.V. (...) was used by major companies to donate money to the CDU anonymously, while the donations were fully tax deductible due to the Vereinigung being considered non-profit. Just in the election year 1972, 30 million Deutsche Mark {{are said to have}} been accumulated in this fashion. Over the course of its existence, the Vereinigung gave 214 million Deutsche Marks to political parties between 1969 and 1980.
