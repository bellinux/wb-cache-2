25|$|The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has {{a number}} of habitat {{conservation}} programs in effect which includes lands traditionally inhabited by the Mission blue butterfly. A recovery plan, drawn up by the USFWS in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off-highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants. An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen agencies {{can be found in the}} Marin Headlands at Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area.</b> In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities, as well as damaging existing ones.|$|E
25|$|P. i. missionensis is federally {{endangered}} {{and found}} {{in only a}} few locations. Its habitat is restricted to the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically six areas, the Twin Peaks area in San Francisco County, Fort Baker, a former military installation managed by the National Park Service (NPS), in Marin County, the San Bruno Mountain area in San Mateo County, the Marin Headlands, in Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> (another NPS entity), Laurelwood Park and Sugarloaf Open Space in the city of San Mateo, and Skyline Ridge, also in San Mateo County. San Bruno Mountain hosts the largest population of Mission blues, a butterfly commonly found around elevations of 700feet. The coastal scrubland and grassland the Mission blue requires is found only in and around the Golden Gate of San Francisco. The butterfly depends solely on three species of perennial lupine for its reproduction, the varied lupine, silver lupine, and the summer lupine. The Mission blue requires the lupine to lay their eggs and nourish the larvae. Without these species, the it cannot reproduce and thus cannot survive. Thus, the Mission blue's habitat parallels that of the lupine species.|$|E

25|$|The San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park {{opened to}} the public on October 2, 1963, and the ship {{opened to the}} public as a museum ship on October 10, 1963. Within years of its opening, serious {{deterioration}} threatened the ship and became critical in August 1969 when a leak raised the rate at which it took on water to 600 gallons per hour and in strong winds to 1,000 gallons per hour. The ships two pumps were capable of handling this flow, but two weeks later the leak doubled to 2,000 gallons per hour. In a dive, the leak was found and staunched with oakum and burlap and it was later reinforced to be fixed at the next dry docking, in November 1970. In October 1972, the United States Congress established the Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> and the San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park was intentionally included in its range. In September 1977, the State of California donated the park and the collections to the federal government and it was reorganized as the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In 1979, the Wapamas condition had deteriorated to the point that significant repairs were needed to restore the ship's structural integrity and it was placed atop a barge.|$|E
