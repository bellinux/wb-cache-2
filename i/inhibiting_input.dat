50|$|In {{attention}} research, {{one prominent}} theory attempting {{to explain how}} visual attention is shifted is the moving-spotlight theory. The primary idea being that attention is like a movable spotlight that is directed towards intended targets, focusing on each target in a serial manner. When information is illuminated by the spotlight, hence attended, processing proceeds in a more efficient manner, directing attention to a particular point and <b>inhibiting</b> <b>input</b> from any stimuli outside of the spotlight. However, when a shift of spatial attention occurs, the spotlight is, in effect, turned off while attention shifts to the next attended location. Attention, however, has also been proposed to adhere to a gradient theory in which attentional resources are given to a region in space rather than a spotlight, so that attentional resources are most concentrated {{at the center of}} attentional focus and then decrease the further a stimuli is from the center. Attention in this theory reflects both current and previous attentional allocation, so that attention can build up and decay across more than one attentional fixation over time. This means that time to detect a target may be dependent upon where attention was directed before the target was presented and attention needed to be shifted.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the origin of}} spike frequency adaptation within a layered sensory network: the auditory pathway of locusts. Spike frequency adaptation as observed in an individual neuron may arise because of intrinsic or presynaptic adaptation mechanisms. To separate the contribution of different mechanisms, we recorded from the same cell during acoustic and intracellular current stimulation. We studied three identified neuron types that are representative for each network layer and participate in processing auditory patterns and localizing sound sources. By comparing current and acoustic stimulation, three distinct patterns {{of the distribution of}} adaptation mechanisms within the sensory network emerged: (1) balanced influence of both intrinsic and presynaptic adaptation mechanisms in an interneuron that summates over several receptor afferents (TN 1), (2) predominantly <b>inhibiting</b> <b>input</b> as the source for spike frequency adaptation in a cell that transmits both pattern representation and directional information (BSN 1), (3) primarily intrinsic, spiketriggered adaptation currents within an interneuron coding exclusively for direction (AN 2). The time courses of spike frequency adaptation differed significantly between the cells types. Using the adaptation time constants, we were able to predict signal transmission properties for the different cells. We conclude that the adaptation mechanisms differ greatly among interneurons within this sensory pathway and are a function of their role in information processing.

I took part {{in the development of the}} model in the relation to extant models of binocular rivalry, and wrote the introduction and the discussion sections of the paper. Peter Ashwin ran the simulations and wrote the sections of the paper that present: the model in mathematical formalism, the results from simulations and the related mathematical proofs. We discuss a novel minimal model for binocular rivalry (and more generally perceptual dominance) effects. The model has only three state variables, but nonetheless exhibits a wide range of input and noise-dependent switching. The model has two reciprocally <b>inhibiting</b> <b>input</b> variables that represent perceptual processes active during the recognition of one of the two possible states and a third variable that represents the perceived output. Sensory inputs only affect the input variables. We observe, for rivalry-inducing inputs, the appearance of winnerless competition in the perceptual system. This gives rise to a behaviour that conforms to well-known principles describing binocular rivalry (the Levelt propositions, in particular proposition IV: monotonic response of residence time as a function of image contrast) down to very low levels of stimulus intensity...|$|E

40|$|Restricted {{cochlear}} lesions {{in adult}} animals result in plastic {{changes in the}} representation of the lesioned cochlea, and thus in the frequency map, in the contralateral auditory cortex and thalamus. To examine the contribution of subthalamic changes to this reorganization, the effects of unilateral mechanical cochlear lesions on the frequency organization of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) were examined in adult cats. Lesions typically resulted in a broad high-frequency hearing loss extending from a frequency in the range 15 - 22 kHz. After recovery periods of 2. 5 - 18 months, the frequency organization of ICC contralateral to the lesioned cochlea was determined separately for the onset and late components of multiunit responses to tone-burst stimuli. For the late response component in all but one penetration through the ICC, and for the onset response component in {{more than half of the}} penetrations, changes in frequency organization in the lesion projection zone were explicable as the residue of prelesion responses. In half of the penetrations exhibiting nonresidue type changes in onset-response frequency organization, the changes appeared to reflect the unmasking of normally <b>inhibited</b> <b>inputs.</b> In the other half it was unclear whether the changes reflected unmasking or a dynamic process of reorganization. Thus, most of the observed changes were explicable as passive consequences of the lesion, and there was limited evidence for plasticity in the ICC.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{anatomical}} and behavioural {{evidence that}} μ- and δ-opioid receptors modulate distinct nociceptive modalities within the superficial dorsal horn. The {{aim of the}} present study was to examine whether μ- and δ-opioid receptor activation differentially modulates TRP sensitive inputs to neurons within the superficial dorsal horn. To do this, whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from lamina I - II neurons in rat spinal cord slices in vitro to examine the effect of opioids on TRP agonist-enhanced glutamatergic spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Results Under basal conditions the μ-opioid agonist DAMGO (3 μM) reduced the rate of miniature EPSCs in 68 % of neurons, while the δ- and κ-opioid agonists deltorphin-II (300 nM) and U 69593 (300 nM) did so in 13 - 17 % of neurons tested. The TRP agonists menthol (400 μM) and icilin (100 μM) both produced a Ca 2 + -dependent increase in miniature EPSC rate which was unaffected by the voltage dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blocker Cd 2 +. The proportion of neurons in which deltorphin-II reduced the miniature EPSC rate was enhanced in the presence of icilin (83 %), but not menthol (0 %). By contrast, the proportion of DAMGO and U 69593 responders was unaltered in the presence of menthol (57 %, 0 %), or icilin (57 %, 17 %). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that δ-opioid receptor activation selectively <b>inhibits</b> <b>inputs</b> activated by icilin, whereas μ-opioid receptor activation has a more widespread effect on synaptic inputs to neurons in the superficial dorsal horn. These findings suggest that δ-opioids may provide a novel analgesic approach for specific, TRPA 1 -like mediated pain modalities. </p...|$|R

Patterns of interglomerular connectivity, however, are largely unknown. To test whether the proximity of glomeruli to one another is correlated with interglomerular inhibitory interactions, we used intracellular recording and staining methods to record the responses of projection (output) neurons (PNs) associated with glomeruli of known olfactory tuning in the primary olfactory center of the moth Manduca sexta. We focused on Toroid I, a glomerulus in the male-specific macroglomerular complex (MGC) specialized {{to one of the}} two key components of the conspecific females' sex pheromone, and the adjacent, sexually isomorphic glomerulus 35, which is highly sensitive to Z- 3 -hexenyl acetate (Z 3 - 6 :OAc).

40|$|SummaryHomeostatic {{regulation}} of energy balance in rodents changes dramatically {{during the first}} 3 postnatal weeks. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus, a primary energy homeostatic center in adults, do not fully innervate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) until the third postnatal week. We have identified two classes of PVN neurons responsive to these neuropeptides, tonically firing neurosecretory (NS) and burst-firing preautonomic (PA) cells. In neonates, NPY could <b>inhibit</b> GABAergic <b>inputs</b> to nearly all NS and PA neurons, while melanocortin regulation was minimal. However, there was a dramatic, age-dependent decrease in NPY responses specifically in the PA neurons, and a 3 -fold increase in melanocortin responses in NS cells. These age-dependent changes were accompanied by changes in spontaneous GABAergic currents onto these neurons. This primarily NPYergic regulation in the neonates likely promotes the positive energy balance necessary for growth, while the developmental switch correlates with maturation of homeostatic {{regulation of}} energy balance...|$|R

We have studied the involvement of GABA(A) -mediated inhibition in the processing of birdsong, a learned vocal communication signal requiring intact hearing for its development and maintenance. We focused on caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), an area analogous to parts of the mammalian auditory cortex with selective responses to birdsong. We present evidence that GABA(A) -mediated inhibition plays a pronounced role in NCM`s auditory processing of birdsong. Using immunocytochemistry, we show that approximately half of NCM`s neurons are GABAergic.

Multi-electrode electrophysiological recordings in awake birds show that local blockade of GABA(A) -mediated inhibition in NCM markedly affects the temporal pattern of song-evoked responses in NCM without modifications in frequency tuning.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{amount of}} literature {{is available on}} drugs of abuse. However, current knowledge on cellular and molecular mechanisms of actions is insufficient and hampers treatment of intoxicated patients. Drugs of abuse cause 100. 000 hospital admissions yearly only in the US. Therefore, we investigated theeffects commonly used illicit drugs have on dopaminergic neurotransmission. Most tested drugs induced opposite effects, e. g., decreasing cholinergic input (possibly decreasing dopaminergic output) combined with decreasing GABA-ergic input (possibly increasing dopaminergic output). Predicting the ultimate effects in vivo is difficult and {{will depend on the}} investigated brain area, the drug concentration and other, not investigated, inputs on the dopaminergic system. In our studies, amphetamine did not induce changes in the basal intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) or dopamine exocytosis. However, at a high amphetamine concentration, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) were <b>inhibited,</b> GABA-ergic <b>input</b> was increased and cholinergic input was decreased. All these mechanisms can contribute to reducing dopamine release following exposure to high concentrations of amphetamine. At a lower, recreational concentration, amphetamine increased cholinergic input, which could increase dopaminergic output. Methamphetamine inhibited VGCCs and cholinergic input at a high concentration, possibly reducing dopaminergic output. However, GABA-ergic input was either decreased or unaffected, which could respectively increase or not affect dopaminergic output. At a lower, recreational concentration, methamphetamine increased cholinergic input, possibly contributing to higher dopamine levels. We also observed 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) - and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-amphetamine (MDA) -induced inhibitions of VGCCs, depolarization-evoked dopamine release and cholinergic input at high concentrations. Metabolism could increase MDMAs neurotoxic effects since its metabolite MDA was more potent. Also, MDA potentiates GABA-ergic input (at high GABA receptor occupancy), further decreasing DA release. However, at low GABA receptor occupancy, both MDMA and MDA <b>inhibit</b> GABA-ergic <b>input.</b> This mechanism possibly contributes to drug-induced increases in extracellular dopamine levels. Meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) has been suggested as a safe alternative to MDMA. However, of all tested drugs, mCPP induced the strongest effects on all endpoints measured in our studies. At a high concentration, mCPP almost completely inhibited depolarization-evoked and ACh-evoked increases in [Ca 2 +]i. Thus, mCPP inhibits VGCCs and cholinergic input. Furthermore, mCPP increased GABA-ergic input (at high receptor occupancy). All these mechanisms could contribute to a decrease in dopamine release. However, mCPP decreased GABA-ergic input at low receptor occupancy, which could enhance dopamine release. Overall, drugs of abuse can modulate the dopaminergic system. The degree of modulation depends on the type and concentration of the drug {{as well as on the}} concentration of the endogenous receptor ligands. Therefore, a spectrum of effects is expected, and reported, following in vivo exposure. Consequently, predicting the effects methamphetamine, amphetamine, MDMA, MDA and mCPP will induce in the in vivo situation is difficult.

The striatum is the biggest input nucleus to the basal ganglia and {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the role of inhibitory GABAA and glycine receptors in regulating synaptic activity in the dorsolateral (DLS) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, nAc). Local field potential recordings from coronal brain slices of juvenile and adult Wistar rats showed that GABAA receptors and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are tonically activated and <b>inhibit</b> excitatory <b>input</b> to the DLS and to the nAc. Strychnine-induced disinhibition of glutamatergic transmission was insensitive to the muscarinic receptor inhibitor scopolamine (10 &# 181;M), inhibited by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist mecamylamine (10 &# 181;M) and blocked by GABAA receptor inhibitors, suggesting that tonically activated glycine receptors depress excitatory input to the striatum through modulation of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. As an end-product example of striatal GABAergic output in vivo we measured dopamine release in the DLS and nAc by microdialysis in the awake and freely moving rat. Reversed dialysis of bicuculline (50 μM in perfusate) only increased extrasynaptic dopamine levels in the nAc, while strychnine administered locally (200 μM in perfusate) decreased dopamine output by 60 % in both the DLS and nAc. Our data suggest that GABAA and glycine receptors are tonically activated and modulate striatal transmission in a partially sub-region specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from substantia gelatinosa (s. g.) neurones in slices cut from adult rat spinal cord and maintained in vitro. Noradrenaline applied by superfusion (1 - 50 microM), or by brief pressure ejection from a micropipette, reversibly hyperpolarized 80 % of the s. g. cells. The noradrenaline induced hyperpolarization was associated {{with an increase in}} conductance and it reversed in polarity at - 88 mV. The reversal potential changed when the external potassium concentration was changed, as predicted by the Nernst equation. The noradrenaline hyperpolarization was antagonized by phentolamine and yohimbine but not by propranolol and prazosin. The hyperpolarization was probably a direct action on the impaled cell and not due to release or block of release of other transmitters, because the effects persisted during a perfusion with a low calcium/high magnesium solution or in a solution containing cobalt and high magnesium. In 35 of 148 cells, noradrenaline caused a dose-related increase of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s). This effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin. The noradrenaline induced increase in e. p. s. p. s was blocked by phentolamine and prazosin but not by the alpha 2 -blockers yohimbine and RX 781094. A few cells were depolarized by noradrenaline, and this was blocked by prazosin but not by yohimbine. It is suggested that noradrenaline may <b>inhibit</b> nociceptive <b>input</b> to the spinal cord by increasing the potassium conductance of s. g. neurones...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral stimuli facilitate, at a pre-motoneuronal level, the {{responses}} elicited in human upper limb motoneurons (MNs) by {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} over the motor cortex (TMS). Several features indicate that the relevant premotoneurones are distinct from segmental interneurones and located rostral to MNs. Thus, corticospinal volleys would have an indirect (propriospinal) pathway to upper limb MNs, {{in addition to the}} direct cortico-motoneuronal pathway. Slightly increasing the corticospinal input causes the facilitation to be reversed to inhibition. This is consistent with a well-developed system of inhibitory intemeurones activated by corticospinal and afferent <b>inputs</b> <b>inhibiting</b> propriospinal neurones (PNs). Corticospinal activation of these inhibitory interneurones would explain why propriospinally-mediated corticospinal EPSPs are weak in primate MNs after artificial (electrical or magnetic) activation of the corticospinal system by itself. However, indirect evidence for descending facilitation of PNs can be provided during normal voluntary contractions, while using the modulation of the ongoing EMG or of the H reflex...|$|R
