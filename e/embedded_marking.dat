These <b>embedded</b> <b>marks</b> are typically imperceptible (invisible) that can later be detected or extracted. This paper describes watermarking process and attacks on watermarks. Also a focus is made on various techniques of implementing watermarks.

Digital networks provide an efficient cost-effective means of distributing digital media. The popularity of the World Wide Web has clearly demonstrated the commercial potential of the digital multimedia market. Unfortunately however, digital networks and multimedia also afford virtually unprecendented opportunities to pirate copyrighted material. The idea of using a robust digital watermark to detect and trace copyright violations has therefore stimulated significant interest among artists and publishers. As a result, digital image watermarking has recently become a very active area of research. Techniques for hiding watermarks have grown steadily more sophisticated and increasingly robust to lossy image compression and standard image processing operations, as well as to cryptographic attack. Many of the current techniques for <b>embedding</b> <b>marks</b> in digital images have been inspired by methods of image coding and compression. Information has been embedded using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [16, 34, 5, 6] Discrete Fourier Transform magnitude and phase [15], Wavelets [16], Linear Predictive Coding [13] and Fractals [9, 22]. The key to making watermarks robust has been the recognition that in order for a watermark to be robust it must be embedded in the perceptually significant components of the image [16, 5, 6]. The term "perceptually significant" is so [...] ...|$|R

3000|$|Imperceptibility and {{robustness}} of the <b>embedded</b> <b>marks</b> {{are often}} conflicting requirements. This is experimentally confirmed by observing that the <b>embedded</b> <b>marks</b> can be extracted with less errors from LDR images obtained when using a lower value of Δ, since the resulting quantization step is much larger, {{even if the}} imperceptibility is negatively affected. It can be also seen that selecting {{a large number of}} directions for embedding purposes improves the mark extraction capabilities, although slightly affecting the imperceptibility of the performed modifications. Moreover, excluding the most energetic direction during the embedding worsens the achievable BERs, even if it is beneficial from the imperceptibility point of view, for both H= 3 and H= 5. As for the number of coefficients C marked for each direction, no meaningful difference in terms of BER can be noticed, thus suggesting to use C= 3, even if at the cost of a higher visibility of the modifications. It has also to be noticed that, although increasing the block dimension P significantly improves mark imperceptibility, it does not affect negatively the mark extraction capability, making thus preferable the selection of large block values such as P= 17. With such a selection, and exploiting a system configuration with Δ= 2, [h [...]...|$|R
3000|$|As can be {{seen from}} the results {{reported}} in Table 5, although decreasing the block dimension P would imply the possibility of embedding more bits in a given HDR image as shown in Table 4, it would also result in an increased probability of detecting a modification in the marked HDR image. The obtained results also show that the <b>embedded</b> <b>mark</b> is more imperceptible as the parameter Δ is set to higher values, since a smaller quantization step 1 / 2 ^Δ is thus obtained. Moreover, selecting the H= 3 first most energetic directions to <b>embed</b> the <b>mark</b> in each image block guarantees a lower perceptual impact than using H= 5 directions. Within this regard, it can be also noticed that mark imperceptibility can be improved by discarding the most energetic projection for the embedding, as it is shown by the results achieved with [h [...]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{describe}} a new scheme of image Watermarking based on 5 / 3 Wavelet decomposition and turbo-code. This new Watermarking algorithm is based on <b>embedding</b> <b>mark</b> (signature) in the multi-resolution field. For the purpose of increasing the image Watermarking robustness against attacks of an image transmission, we encode with a turbo code an image-embedded mark. This new scheme of image Watermarking is able to embed 2000 bits in medical images. Results of experiments carried out on a database of 30 - 256 × 256 pixel-sized medical images show that Watermarks are robust to Noises, Filter attacks and JPEG Compression. The image degradation is measured by Relative Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (R. P. S. N. R.). Experimental results show that this unit of measurement is the best distortion metric witch is correlated with Human Visual System (H. V. S.); and therefore more suitable for digital Watermarking.

Information is concealed by changing some properties of the data, which does not incur extra overheads to the sensor nodes. With the help of DOSM, each forwarding node can verify the <b>embedded</b> <b>marks</b> using the source node ID in each packet. This mechanism is used to filter data in a distributed manner. It can also avoid fake and tamper attacks by terminating bad packets {{as soon as they}} are detected. The data security is guaranteed by filtering the inconsistent packets between the hidden data and its source ID, which yields low energy consumption and high reliability.

40|$|Visual {{cryptography}} is {{not much}} in use in spite of possessing several advantages. One {{of the reasons for}} this is the difficulty of use in practice. The shares of visual cryptography are printed on transparencies which need to be superimposed. However, it is not very easy to do precise superposition due to the fine resolution as well as printing noise. Furthermore, many visual cryptography applications need to print shares on paper in which case scanning of the share is necessary. The print and scan process can introduce noise as well which can make the alignment difficult. In this paper, we consider the problem of precise alignment of printed and scanned visual cryptography shares. Due to the vulnerabilities in the spatial domain, we have developed a frequency domain alignment scheme. We employ the Walsh transform to <b>embed</b> <b>marks</b> in both of the shares so as to find the alignment position of these shares.

40|$|Abstract — {{the extreme}} {{development}} of internet {{has made the}} transmission, distribution and access to digital media very convenient. So, media producers are more frequently dealing with illegal and unauthorized usage of their productions. Over the last two decades, digital watermarking has been addressed as an effective solution to safeguard copyright laws and an extensive effort {{has been made to}} design robust watermarking algorithms. Basically, a digital watermark is an invisible mark that is inserted into a digital media such as audio, image, or video to identify illegal distributions of copyright protected digital media and also law breaking customers. A digital watermark must have special features to achieve functionalities desired. The <b>embedded</b> <b>mark</b> should be robust enough against various watermarking attacks, while keeping the perceived quality of the host signal unchanged (the imperceptibility requirement). Watermarking attacks consist of deliberate attacks made maliciously to remove or change the mark sequence by lawbreakers, unintentional modifications caused by coding and compression that are made to the digital media prior to transmission and/or storage, and errors occurred during the transmission of the media through the networks. Digital watermarking using visual cryptography provides improved security for encrypting secret images...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} watermarking for cryptographic functions and propose a concrete scheme for watermarking cryptographic functions. Informally speaking, a digital watermark-ing scheme for cryptographic functions embeds information, called a mark, into functions such as one-way functions and decryption functions of public-key encryption. There are two basic requirements for watermarking schemes. (1) A mark-embedded function must be function-ally equivalent to the original function. (2) It must be difficult for adversaries to remove the <b>embedded</b> <b>mark</b> without damaging the original functionality. In spite of its importance and usefulness, there have only been a few theoretical works on watermarking for functions (or programs). Furthermore, {{we do not have}} rigorous and meaningful definitions of watermarking for cryptographic functions and concrete constructions. To solve the above problem, we {{introduce a}} notion of watermarking for cryptographic functions and define its security. Furthermore, we present a lossy trapdoor function (LTF) based on the decisional linear (DLIN) problem and a watermarking scheme for the LTF. Our watermarking scheme is secure under the DLIN assumption in the standard model. We use techniques of dual system encryption and dual pairing vector spaces (DPVS) to construct our watermarking scheme. This is a new application of DPVS...|$|R

Content fragile watermarking techniques aim to prevent tampering and fraudulent use of modified images.

40|$|A {{watermarking}} {{scheme for}} programs embeds some information called a mark into a program while preserving its functionality. No adversary can remove the mark without damaging the functionality of the program. In this work, we study {{the problem of}} watermarking various cryptographic programs such as pseudorandom function (PRF) evaluation, decryption, and signing. For example, given a PRF F, we create a marked program eC that evaluates F (). An adversary that gets eC cannot {{come up with any}} program C in which the mark is removed but which still evaluates the PRF correctly on even {{a small fraction of the}} inputs. The work of Barak, Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Sahai, Vadhan, and Yang (CRYPTO’ 01 and Journal of ACM 59 (2)) shows that, assuming indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), such watermarking is impossible if the marked program eC evaluates the original program with perfect correctness.
