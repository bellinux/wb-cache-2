30|$|With {{regard to}} the link quality {{thresholds}} used in DEMON, fixed <b>thresholds</b> <b>set</b> to high values obtain good results under low-load or high-mobility conditions, since they provide a fast reaction to performance degradation. However, in congested networks, fixed <b>thresholds</b> <b>set</b> to high values may lead to excessive route recoveries, which become counterproductive. On the other hand, fixed <b>thresholds</b> <b>set</b> to low values are less sensitive to performance degradation under low load or high mobility; however, under high load, they are more consistent with actual link qualities and thus {{give rise to a}} low number of route recoveries, which leads to good performance. In most considered cases, the best performance is obtained by using a fixed threshold appropriately tuned to the scenario. Nevertheless, the dynamic threshold performs reasonably well in all the scenarios and load conditions. Even so, we plan to study enhancements to the dynamic threshold in order improve its adaptability to the characteristics of a scenario. In particular, networks of varying conditions constitute a challenge.|$|R
40|$|A big {{challenge}} for classification on text is the noisy of text data. It makes classification quality low. Many classification {{process can be}} divided into two sequential steps scoring and <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> (<b>thresholding).</b> Therefore to deal with noisy data problem, it is important to describe positive feature effectively scoring and to <b>set</b> a suitable <b>threshold.</b> Most existing text classifiers do not concentrate on these two jobs. In this paper, we propose a novel text classifier with pattern-based scoring that describe positive feature effectively, followed by <b>threshold</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>thresholding</b> is based on score of training set, make it is simple to implement in other scoring methods. Experiment shows that our pattern-based classifier is promising...|$|R

40|$|Theories on visual {{awareness}} claim that predicted stimuli reach awareness faster than unpredicted ones. In the current study, we disentangle whether prior {{information about the}} upcoming stimulus affects {{visual awareness}} of stimulus location (i. e. individuation) by modulating processing efficiency or <b>threshold</b> <b>setting.</b> Analogous research on stimulus identification revealed that prior information modulates <b>threshold</b> <b>setting.</b> However, as identification and individuation are two functionally and neurally distinct processes, the mechanisms underlying identification cannot simply be extrapolated directly to individuation. The goal {{of this study was}} therefore to investigate how individuation is influenced by prior information about the upcoming stimulus. To do so, a drift diffusion model was fitted to estimate the processing efficiency and <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> for predicted versus unpredicted stimuli in a cued individuation paradigm. Participants were asked to locate a picture, following a cue that was congruent, incongruent or neutral with respect to the picture's identity. Pictures were individuated faster in the congruent and neutral condition compared to the incongruent condition. In the diffusion model analysis, the processing efficiency was not significantly different across conditions. However, the <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> was significantly higher following an incongruent cue compared to both congruent and neutral cues. Our results indicate that predictive information about the upcoming stimulus influences visual awareness by shifting the threshold for individuation rather than by enhancing processing efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{adaptive}} prior detection <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> problem to optimize the overall performance of the joint detection-tracking system for maneuvering target tracking in clutter. It is shown that our problem can be reduced to the information reduction factor (IRF) maximization by Gaussian fitting of maneuvering target Markovian switching dynamics via moment matching, even for the case with the nonlinear measurement equation. Our proposed adaptive <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> method outperforms the conventional <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> approaches greatly and also exhibits a mildly improvement in comparison with the earlier method for this problem in terms of tracking performance, especially in track loss percentage (TLP). However the computational burden of our method is reduced significantly because in our method generally only one IRF corresponding to the common validation region, not the every IRF corresponding to the individual model-conditioned validation region, is needed for threshold optimization at each time step and an approximate closed-form solution can also be obtained for the special case of the Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a 2 D Schrödinger operator H 0 with constant magnetic field, {{on a strip}} of finite width. The spectrum of H 0 is absolutely continuous, and contains a discrete <b>set</b> of <b>thresholds.</b> We perturb H 0 by an electric potential V which decays in a suitable sense at infinity, and study the spectral properties of the perturbed operator H = H 0 + V. First, we establish a Mourre estimate, and as a corollary prove that the singular continuous spectrum of H is empty, and any compact subset of the complement of the <b>threshold</b> <b>set</b> may contain at most a finite set of eigenvalues of H, each of them having a finite multiplicity. Next, we introduce the Krein spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair (H, H 0). We show that this SSF is bounded on any compact subset of the complement of the <b>threshold</b> <b>set,</b> and is continuous away from the <b>threshold</b> <b>set</b> and the eigenvalues of H. The main results of the article concern the asymptotic behaviour of the SSF at th thresholds, which is {{described in terms of}} the SSF for a pair of effective Hamiltonians...|$|R
