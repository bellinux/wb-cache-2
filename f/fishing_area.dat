The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-four <b>fishing</b> <b>areas</b> were {{identified}} and georeferenced according to fishermen's traditional ecological knowledge. Nearly 80 % of the designations of the <b>fishing</b> <b>areas</b> were known by fishermen only and are registered for the first time. Fishermen identify <b>fishing</b> <b>areas</b> according to depth, wooden logs used to anchor fixed nets, gradation of water transparency, and traditional use of certain areas.

25|$|As {{this report}} was {{compiled}} from a Japanese geographical perspective, Japanese {{scholars argue that}} Matsushima (the closer island) refers to Liancourt Rocks and Takeshima (the farther island) refers to Ulleungdo. On the other hand Korean scholars argue that a closer look reveals the grants were given to permit them to travel abroad, thus proving that <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> was foreign territory. These grants led to a conflict with native settlers in Ulleungdo and were later revoked by Kanpaku of Japanese Tokugawa Shogunate in January 1696.|$|E

25|$|The Hudson is {{sometimes}} called, in geological terms, a drowned river.

This project was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which later became Logan's longest runway. Residents of the neighborhood, known as Wood Island, were bought {{out of their homes}} and forced to relocate. Public opposition came to a head when residents lay down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the construction zone.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the {{fishermen}} at Brixham needed {{to expand their}} <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon.

The most important inland <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> is the Ob’–Irtysh River Basin (about 27 percent). Sixty species {{are caught in the}} inland fisheries of Russia. In volume terms, whitefish (Coregonidae), cyprinids, zanders and perch are most important. Set nets are the most common gear used in inland water commercial fisheries. Seines are also used on big rivers and lakes, and small trawls on the big lakes. In 2005, the official catch in the inland waters was 72,000 tonnes.|$|E
