40|$|SummaryRibosome {{dynamics}} play {{an important}} role in translation. The rotation of the ribosomal subunits relative to one another is essential for tRNA-mRNA translocation. An important unresolved question is whether subunit rotation limits the rate of translocation. Here, we monitor subunit rotation relative to peptide bond formation and translocation using ensemble kinetics and single-molecule FRET. We observe that spontaneous <b>forward</b> subunit <b>rotation</b> occurs at a rate of 40  s− 1, independent of the rate of preceding peptide bond formation. Elongation factor G (EF-G) accelerates <b>forward</b> subunit <b>rotation</b> to 200 s− 1. tRNA-mRNA movement is much slower (10 – 40 s− 1), suggesting that <b>forward</b> subunit <b>rotation</b> does not limit the rate of translocation. The transition back to the non-rotated state of the ribosome kinetically coincides with tRNA-mRNA movement. Thus, large-scale movements of the ribosome are intrinsically rapid and gated by its ligands such as EF-G and tRNA...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Individuals {{with short}} lower {{anterior}} facial height (LAFH), reduced mandibular plane angle, and excessive overbite resulting from upward and <b>forward</b> mandibular <b>rotation</b> are traditionally classified as skeletal deep bites. Our {{purpose was to}} explore phenotypic variation within short LAFH individuals using geometric morphometric methods. Methods: Cephalograms of 101 individuals (64 female, 37 male; age range: 7 - 62 years) with LAFH to total anterior facial height (TAFH), ratio (LAFH/TAFH), at or below 52. 6 % were studied. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and canonical variate analysis captured phenotypic variation and identified homogenous groups. Results: Four principal components were identified which accounted for 49 % of the variation within the skeletal vertical and sagittal dimensions, flexure of the gonial angle, and incisor angulation. Cluster analysis resulted in 3 discrete short LAFH subpenotypes. Conclusions: Within the selected population of short LAFH individuals, we found: A range of morphologic variation. Convergent and divergent facial patterns with concomitant variation in gonial angle and ramus height. Anteriorly directed condylar morphology correlated with characteristics of extreme forward mandibular rotation; less anteriorly directed condylar morphology correlated with characteristics of backward mandibular rotation.

These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both <b>forward</b> <b>rotation</b> (forward loop, cheese roll) and backward rotations(back-loop, push-loop).

50|$|In a torque {{converter}} {{there are at}} least three rotating elements: the impeller, which is mechanically driven by the prime mover; the turbine, which drives the load; and the stator, which is interposed between the impeller and turbine so that it can alter oil flow returning from the turbine to the impeller. The classic {{torque converter}} design dictates that the stator be prevented from rotating under any condition, hence the term stator. In practice, however, the stator is mounted on an overrunning clutch, which prevents the stator from counter-rotating with respect to the prime mover but allows <b>forward</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
30|$|Ida et al. [28] used X-rays to {{evaluate}} the pelvic posture among cases of acetabular dysplasia (AD) (100 hips from 94 patients, mostly female) with (40 hips) and without (60 hips) cam deformity, {{and found that the}} pelves with combined AD and cam-FAI showed higher <b>forward</b> pelvic <b>rotation</b> (i.e., lower PT) while standing than pelves with pure dysplasia. In detail, the authors measured two less common pelvic parameters, the pelvic inclination angle (i.e., the acute sagittal angle between the line joining the promontorium to the upper surface of the pubic symphisis and the vertical axis) and the pelvic angle (i.e., the sagittal acute angle between the line joining the posterior edge of the sacral plate to the midpoint of the bicoxofemoral axis and the vertical axis), and found that both these parameters were significantly reduced when a cam deformity was associated with dysplasia, only in the upright position and not in decubitus. Notwithstanding the different SS, lumbar lordosis did not differ between the two groups. Intra-/inter-rater reliability was properly assessed, examiners were adequately blind regarding clinical information, and the two groups were comparable with regard to the most relevant confounding variables. Unfortunately no information is provided about PI. The authors conclude that cam deformity is associated with significant <b>forward</b> pelvic <b>rotation</b> in dysplastic acetabula, and this might affect the outcome of corrective acetabular surgery, predisposing to postoperative FAI.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Motion sensors {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to obtain spatiotemporal measures of mobility-related activities such as sit-stand and stand-sit transitions. However, the application of new sensor-based methods for assessing sit-stand-sit performance requires the detection of crucial events such as seat on/off in the sensor-based data. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the agreement of detecting sit-stand and stand-sit events based on a novel body-fixed-sensor method with a force-plate based analysis. Methods Twelve older adults and 10 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease with mean age of 70 years performed sit-stand-sit movements while trunk movements were measured with a sensor-unit at vertebrae L 2 -L 4 and reaction forces were measured with separate force plates below the feet and chair. Movement onsets and ends were determined. In addition, seat off and seat on were determined based on forces acting on the chair. Data analysis focused on the agreement of the timing of sit-stand and stand-sit events as detected by the two methods. Results For the start and end of standing-up, only small delays existed for the start of <b>forward</b> trunk <b>rotation</b> and end of backward trunk rotation compared to movement onset/end as detected in the force-plate data. The end of <b>forward</b> trunk <b>rotation</b> had a small and consistent delay compared to seat off, whereas during sitting-down, the end of <b>forward</b> trunk <b>rotation</b> occurred earlier in relation to seat on. In detecting the end of sitting-down, backward trunk rotation ended after reaching the minimum in the below-feet vertical force signal. Since only small time differences existed between the two methods for detecting the start of sitting-down, longer movement durations were found for the sensor-based method. Relative agreement between the two methods in assessing movement duration was high (i. e. ICCs[*]≥[*] 0. 75), except for duration of standing-up in the Parkinson’s patients (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 61). Conclusions This study demonstrated high agreement of body-fixed-sensor based detection of sit-stand and stand-sit events with that based on force plates in older adults and patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease. Further development and testing is needed to establish reliability for unstandardized performance in clinical and home settings. </p...|$|R

This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the net exchange of heat between the black sides and the environment initially cools the black sides faster than the white sides.

For example, if an athlete lands feet first but falls back because they are not correctly balanced, a lower distance will be measured.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the application of the Begg technique in achieving specific treatment objectives in relation to facial type. Emphasis is placed on both the control of incisor position and the vertical position of the mandible. In order to meet these objectives the site of extractions can be varied, as well as components of the Begg system, such as the use of intermaxillary elastics and arch wire modification. In brachyfacial types with <b>forward</b> mandibular growth <b>rotation,</b> treatment objectives may include incisor intrusion and backwards rotation of the mandible using a non-extraction technique. In contrast, in dolichofacial types with <b>forward</b> mandibular growth <b>rotation,</b> intrusion of incisors and a stable vertical mandibular position may be the primary treatment objectives. In these cases extraction of the four first premolars is usually necessary. The objective is a final tooth position which is in harmony with the facial profile, and compatible with subsequent occlusal maturation...|$|R
40|$|Knee {{movements}} play {{a critical}} role in most balance corrections. Loss of knee flexibility may cause postural instability. Conversely, trained voluntary knee flexions executed during balance corrections might help to overcome balance deficits. We examined whether bilateral knee flexion could be added to automatic balance corrections generated by sudden balance perturbations. We investigated how this could be achieved and whether it improved or worsened balance control. Twenty-four healthy subjects participated in three different test conditions, in which they had to flex their knees following an auditory cue (VOLUNTARY condition), had to restore their balance in response to multidirectional rotations of a support surface (REACTIVE condition), or the combination of these two (COMBINED condition). A new variable set (PREDICTED), calculated as the mathematical sum of VOLUNTARY and REACTIVE, was compared with the COMBINED variable set. COMBINED responses following <b>forward</b> <b>rotations</b> were close to PREDICTED, or greater, suggesting adequate integration of knee flexion into the automatic balance reactions. For backward rotations, the COMBINED condition resulted in several near-falls, and this was generally associated with smaller knee flexion and smaller EMG responses. Subjects compensated by using greater trunk flexion and arm movements. Activity in several muscles displayed earlier onsets for the COMBINED condition following backward rotations. We conclude that healthy adults can incorporate voluntary knee flexion into their automatic balance corrections and that this depends on the direction of the postural perturbation. These findings highlight the flexibility of the human balance repertoire and underscore both the advantages and limitations of using trained voluntary movements to aid balance corrections in man...|$|R
