When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>party,</b> while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening.

They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>party,</b> and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] was {{directed}} by Vaughan Arnell. On 24 August 2012, One Direction announced that an accompanying music video for [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] was filmed at a [...] "secret place." [...] Afterwards {{it was confirmed that}} this place was Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. In August 2012, images of the shoot leaked on to the internet, which featured members of One Direction along with a group of people <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> in a pool. According to a MTV News article published on 14 September 2012, the video would feature a [...] "summer music festival vibe" [...] with the group [...] "getting wet and wild, acting silly with props and getting soaked by water guns." [...] The official video was initially due to premiere on 24 September 2012. However, a poor quality version of the music video leaked online on 20 September 2012: the same day it was officially published on One Direction's Vevo channel on YouTube.

It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who is smiling with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, [...] "Whatever," [...] to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an {{apparent}} semi-futuristic world, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style chair in front of a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on {{the very edge of the}} bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed from the chair, are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, [...] "few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'".

2500|$|November 1977 saw {{the release}} of the jazz-funk {{oriented}} <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>Party</b> [...] which would be the final album release featuring the Pointer Sisters in their original four-woman format: in fact it was only on the title cut that all four members sang, the album's other cuts featuring Anita, Bonnie and Ruth but not June Pointer. Recorded in 1976 the album's release was so delayed as to cause an eighteen-month gap between <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>Party</b> and the precedent Pointer Sisters' album Steppin - the compilation album The Best of the Pointer Sisters had been issued in July 1976 - and without the impetus of a major hit single the <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>Party</b> album itself caused scant commercial interest. One track, [...] "Don't It Drive You Crazy" [...] with Bonnie Pointer on lead, would become a cult hit in the UK as part of the rare groove phenomenon.|$|E
