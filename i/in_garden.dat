5|$|External parasites of {{the garden}} warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur <b>in</b> <b>garden</b> warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Garden</b> Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} the highway {{like all other}} state trunkline highways under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its highways. These surveys are expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the traffic counts for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that 692vehicles a day used the segment near the state park. Through the middle section <b>in</b> <b>Garden,</b> the peak volume was 892vehicles daily which dropped to 878at the USjunction. The commercial AADT was 54trucks for the entire highway. M-183 has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown <b>in</b> <b>garden</b> plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{returned}} to Assam in June 1943, to organize for Bissell the Assam-American Air Base Command (AAABC) which he led as a mixed force composed primarily of Tenth Air Force units with {{some elements of}} the Fourteenth Air Force. Haynes was tasked with coordinating area defense and offensive destruction of the enemy, {{the emphasis on the}} former. For the first two months, Haynes was given fewer officers and men than he deemed necessary, and the AAABC made little headway in its mission. In mid-August, large-scale re-organization of Allied forces in Asia resulted in the AAABC being renamed the , and placed under George E. Stratemeyer. Haynes led the group until September 1943, when he {{returned to}} the U.S. after 18 months in Asia. Before he left, he told American reporters that his forces had helped deny the port of Rangoon to the enemy, and helped soften Burma for invasion. He stated that the highlight of his time in Asia was the air raid against Hong Kong. After his upcoming air crossing of the Atlantic, his eighth such, Haynes said that the first thing he intended to do was look up his 14-year-old son in high school and his wife who was working in the drafting department at Sperry <b>in</b> <b>Garden</b> City, New York.|$|E
