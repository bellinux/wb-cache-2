5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} long-term {{trends in}} antibiotic resistance of common bacterial species isolated {{at a university}} hospital and in its intensive care units (ICUs). MethodsLevels of antibiotic resistance of common bacterial pathogens were investigated at the Karolinska Hospital during the 12 -year period 1988 - 99. Resistance rates were analyzed for the entire hospital, {{as well as for}} <b>ICUs</b> combined. ResultsAt <b>the</b> Karolinska Hospital, we found increased ciprofloxacin resistance among Escherichia coli isolates, from 0 % in 1991 to 11 % <b>in</b> 1999. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs,</b> <b>the</b> corresponding increase was from 0 % to 4. 8 % during the same period. Co-trimoxazole resistance levels increased from 7. 5 % to 14 %, with lower levels for <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> For ampicillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin, the levels of resistance were similar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole hospital and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, imipenem resistance was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> For ciprofloxacin, resistance increased from 2. 5 % in 1991 to 13 % <b>in</b> 1999 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole hospital, with similar figures for <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> ConclusionThe resistance rates at the Karolinska Hospital were still generally low, but were increasing for some antibiotic-microbe combinations. The results emphasize the importance of including all sectors of a hospital in resistance surveillance studies, and also the value of long surveillance periods...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{risk for}} {{nosocomial}} infections (NIs) is 5 - 10 times higher in patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Intensive Care Units (ICUs) than in patients staying <b>in</b> other wards. <b>The</b> higher incidence rates of NIs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> {{may be explained}} by the fact that <b>the</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> have more severe underlying disease, and are exposed to the invasive diagnostic and therapeutical procedures. The unreasonable use of antibiotics leads to the selection of multiresistant agents, which have been increasingly recorded as the NIs causative agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of NIs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period January-June 2005. Methods. The study of incidence was performed <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> methodology of the Centers for Diseases and Prevention. Any infections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period from January to June 2005 were registered. The results both from medical documentation and from the direct contacts with the medical personnel were analyzed. The samples were tested using standard methods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microbiological laboratory. Results. The incidence rates of NIs patients ranged from 1. 5 to 40. 8, and the incidence rates of infections were 1. 5 to 65. 6 per 1 000 patient’s days. Out of the total number of NIs, urinary infections accounted for 44. 6 %, blood infections for 37. 6 %, and surgical site infections for 16. 9 %. Conclusion. The most frequent cause of nosocomial urinary infections was Klebsiella, of nosocomial sepsis - coagulase − negative staphylococci, and of surgical site infections - Staphylococcus aureus...|$|R

30|$|Results Fifty-seven {{booklets}} {{were distributed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU</b> (8  % of admitted patients). During {{the study period}} (07 / 2014 – 07 / 2015), 93 children were likely to visit their relative. A total of 195 staff members participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study (75  % of ICU staff).

Participants were equally recruited at <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU</b> (87 participants, 74  % of <b>ICU</b> staff) and <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (108 participants, 76  % of <b>ICU</b> staff). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of staff members who supported at least one visiting child over the 3  months prior to the questionnaire increased from 41  % before the intervention to 69  % after the intervention (p <  0.001), whereas it was not significantly different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (38 vs 39  %, p =  0.97). A multivariate analysis confirmed {{that the use of}} the booklet was an independent factor for increasing the rate of caregivers who supported visiting children [OR 4.0, 95  % CI [2.0; 7.9], p <  0.001]. No significant effect of occupation (OR 0.9, p =  0.89), age (OR 1.7, p =  0.15) and years of experience in critical care (OR 0.7, p =  0.34) emerged from this analysis. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of participants who disagreed with child visits decreased from 35 to 14  % (p =  0.002), whereas it remained stable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (30 vs 34  %, p =  0.51). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of participants who claimed that the admission policy for child visits had to be improved decreased from 94 to 76  % (p =  0.001), whereas it remained stable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (91 vs 91  %, p =  0.94).

25|$|Each year, {{more than}} 2.5 {{million people in}} the United States develop {{pressure}} ulcers. In acute care settings in the United States, the incidence of bedsores is 0.4% to 38%; within long-term care it is 2.2% to 23.9%, and in home care, it is 0% to 17%. Similarly, there is wide variation in prevalence: 10% to 18% in acute care, 2.3% to 28% in long-term care, and 0% to 29% in home care. There is a much higher rate of bedsores in intensive care units because of immunocompromised individuals, with 8% to 40% of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> developing bedsores. However, pressure ulcer prevalence is highly dependent on the methodology used to collect the data. Using the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) methodology there are similar figures for pressure ulcers in acutely sick people in the hospital. There are differences across countries, but using this methodology pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe was consistently high, from 8.3% (Italy) to 22.9% (Sweden). A recent study in Jordan also showed a figure in this range. Some research shows differences in pressure-ulcer detection among white and black residents in nursing homes.|$|E

500|$|At Fifth Year Festival: Chicago, the Brothers {{finally reached}} the top of the {{mountain}} again, defeating Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal to win the tag team championship. Their reign, however, proved to be brief, as they in turn to dropped the belts to Naruki Doi and Shingo Takagi in their first defense, at Fifth Year Festival: Liverpool. After this match, the storyline was that the brothers felt they needed to [...] "man up" [...] due to losing the title in their first defense, just as they had the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship earlier in the year. Thus, the two faced off what was described as [...] "one time only" [...] at Fifth Year Festival: Finale. The match ended in a draw, with both of them unable to answer the referee's standing ten-count. At the next event, All Star Extravaganza III, they won the title back from Doi and Shingo, but in the course of the match Mark was seriously injured attempting a Shooting Star Press to the floor. Mark was kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> of hospital for two nights, and suffered a seizure there before eventually being released. Two weeks later, at Fighting Spirit, Mark made an unadvertised and unannounced return, entering through the crowd to come to his brother's side during his match with Erick Stevens against Kevin Steen and El Generico. The storyline was that with Mark out and injured, Jay was tagging with Stevens as a replacement. The No Remorse Corps then ran in and attacked Stevens, and Jay was momentarily left without a partner until Mark entered. Mark eventually suffered the fall in the match after several bumps to the head. They then began to feud with Steen and Generico. After successfully retaining the tag title over Claudio Castagnoli and Matt Sydal at ROH's first pay-per-view Respect is Earned, Steen and Generico showed up and immediately demanded their title shot; the scene followed with a wild brawl all over the building. The feud was followed on both ROH's standard canon, with Steen defeating Mark at A Fight at the Roxbury, and the PPV series, with the Brothers successfully retaining the tag team title against Steen and Generico at Driven, after which Steen repeatedly attacked both brothers with a ladder. The Briscoes then retained over Steen and Generico in a steel cage match at Caged Rage and in ROH's first-ever ladder match at Man Up.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{formatting}} the medical order sheet {{has an effect}} on the accuracy and security of antibiotics prescription. DESIGN: Prospective assessment of antibiotics prescription over time, before and after <b>the</b> intervention, <b>in</b> comparison with a control ward. SETTING: The medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical or surgical ICU between February 1 and April 30, 1997, and July 1 and August 31, 2000, for whom antibiotics were prescribed. INTERVENTION: Formatting of the medical order sheet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surgical <b>ICU</b> <b>in</b> 1998. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compliance with the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists' criteria for prescription safety was measured. The proportion of safe orders increased in both units, but the increase was 4. 6 times greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surgical <b>ICU</b> (66 % vs. 74 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>ICU</b> and 48 % vs. 74 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surgical <b>ICU).</b> For unsafe orders, the proportion of ambiguous orders decreased by half <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>ICU</b> (9 % vs. 17 %) and nearly disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surgical <b>ICU</b> (1 % vs. 30 %). The only missing criterion remaining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surgical <b>ICU</b> was <b>the</b> drug dose unit, which could not be preformatted. The aim of antibiotics prescription (either prophylactic or therapeutic) was indicated only in 51 % of the order sheets. CONCLUSIONS: Formatting of the order sheet markedly increased security of antibiotics prescription. These findings must be confirmed in other settings and with different drug classes. Formatting the medical order sheet decreases the potential for prescribing errors before full computerized prescription is available...|$|R
