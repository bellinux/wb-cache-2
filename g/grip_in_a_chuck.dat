A file is [...] "blunt" [...] if its sides and width are both parallel throughout its length. It is [...] "tapered" [...] if there is <b>a</b> reduction <b>in</b> its dimensions from its heel toward its point. A file may taper in width, in thickness, or both. A [...] "tang" [...] is a protrusion at the heel, tapered, parallel sided, or conical, for <b>gripping,</b> inserting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> handle, or mounting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece is held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck.</b> The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R

50|$|The minimum {{requirement}} of <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> box {{is that it}} store the camper's camp kitchen devices.

5000|$|The first {{successful}} drills were the piston type, or [...] "reciprocators." [...] The drill steel piston and chuck moved together and reciprocated. In Leyner's hammer drill the steel was held loosely <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> {{attached to the}} cylinder itself, while the piston inside the cylinder reciprocated, striking blows on the blunt end of the drill steel. The hammer drill was lighter, speedier, and used less air than the reciprocating drill.|$|R

40|$|The model {{presented}} {{in the first part}} of this work is used here to estimate the diameter error in the most common turning operations. In fact, the diameter error is considered as a variable depending on the deflections of the tool, workpiece holder and workpiece, which are considered the main factors responsible for the machining accuracy. The proposed model has been applied to the three most common turning schemes related to workpiece fixturing, where the workpiece is clamped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck,</b> or supported between two centers, or clamped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> at the spindle and supported on a center at the tailstock. Some numerical examples have been computed using the proposed model to predict the diameter error along the workpiece and the cutting force along the workpiece axis, as well as the influence of the cutting force components on the error prediction. The results provide additional insight into error formation in the turning process. Finally, some experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the developed model. Good agreement has been obtained between numerical and experimental results. The proposed model represents a first step towards accuracy control in machining operations and, thus, towards optimization of the manufacturing process...|$|R
