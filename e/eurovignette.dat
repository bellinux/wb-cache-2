5000|$|<b>Eurovignette</b> is a {{road toll}} for trucks of minimum 12 metric tons. The system was adopted in 1999, {{and is used}} in Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Sweden. (Belgium left the <b>Eurovignette</b> scheme on 1 April 2016 {{in favor of a}} distance-based tolling system.) ...|$|E
50|$|Motorways and expressways are a {{toll-free}} road network for all lighter vehicles. The <b>Eurovignette</b> system for trucks was abolished in August 2003. A distance-based toll charge was introduced from 1 January 2005 for vehicles of over 12 tons, {{operated by the}} Toll Collect company.|$|E
50|$|The European Parliament {{is moving}} to ensure that charges on heavy-goods {{vehicles}} should be {{based in part on}} the air and noise pollution they produce and the congestion they cause, according to legislation approved by the Transport Committee. The <b>Eurovignette</b> scheme has been proposed, whereby new charges would be potentially levied against things such as noise and air pollution and also weight related damages from the lorries themselves.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{calculations of}} the costs of road traffic noise in Europe that include the development of improved noise weighting factors according to vehicle class, speed and time of the day. The <b>Eurovignette</b> Directive allows EU Member States to levy infrastructure charges to compensate for the external costs of noise caused by heavy goods vehicles. Here we outline a method to calculate such costs in accordance to the <b>Eurovignette</b> Directive, which requires using weighting factors both for vehicle classes and times of the day. The Directive does not provide specific values or guidelines for calculating these factors. Moreover, while the Directive only focuses on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for day and night, we extend the calculations to other vehicle classes and time periods...|$|E
30|$|In 2007, the European Commission (EC) {{announced}} a European freight transport action plan. One {{of the concepts}} introduced is that of “green transport corridors”. Green transport corridors include shortsea shipping, rail, inland waterways and road transport combinations to enable environmentally friendly transport solutions for the European industry. The EC also proposes to revise the Directive on the charging of road transport for infrastructure use (<b>Eurovignette).</b>|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to analyse}} {{the impact of}} two {{transport}} pricing policies using the PLANET model. The transport policies are (1) a harmonisation of excise duties on petrol and diesel and (2) road pricing for heavy goods vehicles {{in accordance with the}} EU proposal for the <b>Eurovignette</b> III directive. The effects studied concern the consequences for the transport activity for persons and goods, the environmental impact and the impact on social welfare. For both policy types, the impact on the public budget is neutralized through general taxation or labour taxation. Long-term forecasting, Transport policy, Passenger and freight transport...|$|E
40|$|We {{contribute}} {{an extension}} of the agent-based freight transport analysis model TAPAS-Z, whose aim is to simulate decision- making and other activities in transport chains. TAPAS-Z is a further development of the TAPAS model, and it enables stochastic variation, based on statistical distributions, of the locations of senders and receivers of freight, hence providing improved support for simulation of transport between larger regions. The model extension presented in this paper enables stochastic sampling of sender and receiver locations from historically known data, which we argue is beneficial in those situations where such data exist. We also contribute a case study where we used our extended TAPAS-Z model to simulate transport of timber from forest felling places to a Swedish paper mill. The case study illustrates how we recommend conducting a case study using the extended TAPAS-Z model. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the possible implications of a structural change from a time-based to a distance-based <b>Eurovignette</b> system for heavy freight trucks in Sweden, which will lead to increased costs for most road users. As a mitigation action for the increased costs, we studied the possibility to use heavier trucks than the currently allowed 60 tonne trucks. The simulation results suggest that an introduction of a distance-based <b>Eurovignette</b> is expected to cause a small modal shift from road to rail for the studied type of transport. Furthermore, an introduction of larger freight trucks is expected to lead to a complete shift to road transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} <b>Eurovignette</b> Directive 2011 has {{reinforced the}} {{discussion on the}} highly contested ‘polluter pays principle’. This paper presents {{the course of the}} legislative procedure ab ovo ad malum and pinpoints instances of the legislator negotiating beyond the frame of publicity provided by the Treaties. At the same time it provides for a critical analysis of the novelties in the field of charging of heavy goods vehicles on the EU’s roads and reveals that the Council is the true decision-maker in this very legislative project, whereas the Parliament, and even more the Commission, were less able to push through their views. The new Directive has brought some progress in the development of European transport policy, but it could not meet the high expectations this legislative project was accompanied by from its very beginning...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} the Czech toll {{system and its}} future are presented. E-toll Czech project: Facts and Figures (today) are {{included}} and the next steps {{in the process of}} developing microwave infrastructure are mentioned. In the event of possible system extension of the roads of the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd class (ca 55, 000 km), the satellite technology will be used. The feasibility of such a combination of these two technologies, microwave and satellite, is subject to the compatibility of both systems in terms of the control equipment. For the microwave toll system, economic analyses according to EU directives were prepared for the Czech Ministry of Transport. Special attention is paid to the problems of traffic congestion, noise and damage to the environment, on the basis of the "user pays" and "polluter pays" according to the <b>Eurovignette</b> Directive principles. A complete survey of the EU toll system is included in the list of information sources...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 the ‘Eurovignette’ {{directive}} on distance-based {{road pricing}} in Europe was finally {{passed by the}} European Parliament and the European Council. Although this will bring benefits {{to the environment and}} contribute towards financing the cost of maintaining road infrastructure, it will also have negative effects on trade because of the increased costs of accessing markets. This study measures the transfer of revenue (spatial spillovers) derived from the introduction of the <b>Eurovignette</b> directive using a Geographic Information System (GIS). A spatial spillover matrix is obtained that reflects the cost of toll fees on exports paid by each country for the use of roads in each of the other countries. From this spillover matrix between countries and calculation of the repercussion of the fees on the final price of exports, it is possible to know which countries are winners and which are losers as a consequence of introducing a common road pricing policy.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of a re-introduction of a distance-related charge on heavy trucks in Sweden. The {{kilometre}} charge is set to cover the annual road maintenance costs and is calculated for 10 different truck and trailer configurations. Three scenarios are simulated in a CGE model of Sweden: (i) the charge alone is imposed; (ii) the charge is imposed while the sum of the annual <b>Eurovignette</b> charge and the annual vehicle tax is lowered to the minimum level set by the European Union; and (iii) as in the former but with twice the level of the kilometre charge. The results imply that the charge leads to significantly reduced road wear although it appears that most of the reduction stems from reduced trucking activity and not from substitution towards less damaging trucks. Extensive substitutions towards other modes take place and only between 56 and 78 per cent of the ex ante statically predicted amount of tax revenue could actually be expected to be collected once the charge is imposed. The effects seem to cancel out on aggregate. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a charging policy for heavy goods vehicles in European Union (EU) member countries has been imposed to reflect costs of construction and maintenance of infrastructure as well as externalities such as congestion, accidents and environmental impact. In this context, EU countries approved the <b>Eurovignette</b> directive (1999 / 62 /EC) and its amending directive (2006 / 38 /EC) which established a legal framework to regulate the system of tolls. Even if that regulation seek s to increase the efficien cy of freight, it will trigger direct and indirect effects on Spain’s regional economies by increasing transport costs. This paper presents {{the development of a}} multiregional Input-Output methodology (MRIO) with elastic trade coefficients to predict in terregional trade, using transport attributes integrated in multinomial logit models. This method is highly useful to carry out an ex-ante evaluation of transport policies because it involves road freight transport cost sensitivity, and determine regional distributive and substitution economic effect s of countries like Spain, characterized by socio-demographic and economic attributes, differentiated region by region. It will thus be possible to determine cost-effective strategies, given different policy scenarios. MRIO mode l would then be used to determine the impact on the employment rate of imposing a charge in the Madrid-Sevilla corridor in Spain. This methodology is important for measuring the impact on the employment rate since {{it is one of the}} main macroeconomic indicators of Spain’s regional and national economic situation. A previous research developed (DESTINO) using a MRIO method estimated employment impacts of road pricing policy across Spanish regions considering a fuel tax charge (€/liter) in the entire shortest cost path network for freight transport. Actually, it found that the variation in employment is expected to be substantial for some regions, and negligible for others. For example, in this Spanish case study of regional employment has showed reductions between 16. 1 % (Rioja) and 1. 4 % (Madrid region). This variation range seems to be related to either the intensity of freight transport in each region or dependency of regions to transport intensive economic sect ors. In fact, regions with freight transport intensive sectors will lose more jobs while regions with a predominantly service economy undergo a fairly insignificant loss of employment. This paper is focused on evaluating a freight transport vehicle-kilometer charge (€/km) in a non-tolled motorway corridor (A- 4) between Madrid-Sevilla (517 Km.). The consequences of the road pricing policy implementation show s that the employment reductions are not as high as the diminution stated in the previous research because this corridor does not affect the whole freight transport system of Spain...|$|E
