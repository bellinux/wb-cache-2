5|$|Acupuncture <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific {{acute pain}} or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more}} than no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better,</b> because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E

Several participants, such as Sébastien Hinault, implied that he <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|During the program, another psychic {{was doing}} a sorting of 250 Zener cards, {{guessing}} which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, {{she was able to}} get only fifty predictions correct, which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than random guessing.|$|E

25|$|The {{best known}} brand in strobe tuner {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first strobe tuner, the Model 400. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true strobe tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying {{it in a way that}} imitates a strobe tuner.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than in most other states.|$|E

25|$|Serum (blood) {{levels of}} androgens (hormones {{associated}} with male development), including androstenedione and testosterone may be elevated. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels above 700–800µg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made exclusively by the adrenal glands. The free testosterone level {{is thought to}} be the best measure, with ~60% of PCOS patients demonstrating supranormal levels. The Free androgen index (FAI) of the ratio of testosterone to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is high and is meant to be a predictor of free testosterone, but is a poor parameter for this and <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than testosterone alone as a marker for PCOS, possibly because FAI is correlated with the degree of obesity.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Wray - He {{is first}} met playing, and {{cheating}} at, cards with Aubrey in Desolation Island; his cheating is challenged by Aubrey publicly, but no duel ensues. Later, {{he is the}} son-in-law of Admiral Harte, as well as Second Secretary at the Admiralty. He has a poisonous hatred for Jack Aubrey and works silently to blight his career. He is responsible for causing dissension between Maturin and Diana by not passing on his letters to her. He is a double agent working for the French, shown in Treason's Harbour, who passes naval secrets to French intelligence, which pays him generously. He is reluctant to cover his gambling debts on his own funds, asking the French to pass him more money. When his wife Fanny Harte inherits, he will be very wealthy. Her father arranged the marriage in The Ionian Mission and they are married {{by the start of}} the next novel, Treason's Harbour. But Admiral Harte tied the money to his daughter and her children; when he dies in Treason's Harbour, Wray <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> off financially. Wray makes much trouble for the British cause, for the London stock exchange (The Reverse of the Medal) to gain money to pay his debts, and for Aubrey and Maturin, as a shadowy opponent. Wray's dual role is discovered in The Reverse of the Medal and he flees for France in The Letter of Marque, leaving behind proof of his role in manipulating the stock exchange and setting up Aubrey for the blame. He has a homosexual lover, Edward Ledward, another highly placed official in the British Treasury, who is also a spy for France and flees with him when they are exposed by Duhamel. In The Thirteen Gun Salute, Wray and Ledward are part of a French diplomatic mission to Malaya competing for the Malay court's allegiance against a British contingent which includes Aubrey and Maturin. When the French mission fails, Maturin dissects Ledward and Wray after having possibly shot them himself.|$|E

And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been." [...] That same year, Rosen forewarned possible excesses of the new movement; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, PopMatters Rob Horning responded to Rosen's embracing of poptimism and wrote that it is [...] "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction." [...] Writing for The Quietus in 2017, Michael Hann argued that [...] "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and lists the following as a few poptimist [...] "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge": ...|$|E
