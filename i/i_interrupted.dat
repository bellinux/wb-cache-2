5|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> {{the efforts}} to secure a breed standard, with stud book {{selection}} not resuming until 1920. Within a few years, the ideal height was set around , and its breeding spread throughout Auxois and neighboring regions.|$|E
5|$|The Auxois is {{a direct}} {{descendant}} of the Bourguignon of the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, blood was added from other French draft breeds before {{the creation of a}} stud book in 1912. After the creation of the stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> efforts to set the breed standard, but testing resumed in 1920, and between then and World War II the Auxois was the pride of regional farmers. The breed reached its peak in the 1930s, but by the 1960s began to decline with the advent of mechanization.|$|E

In July 1917 he was posted to France as a temporary Warrant Officer in the 3rd Division Artillery. In 1918, {{he was awarded the}} Meritorious Service Medal for gallantry and reached the rank of corporal. The death of his father later in the year led to his repatriation from Britain and prevented his appearance with the AIF cricket team.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army was overwhelmed by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E

During the War, Hill worked on the college textbook.|$|E
25|$|The McMillan Plan in {{many respects}} was an early form of urban renewal that removed many of the slums that {{surrounded}} the Capitol, replacing them with new public monuments and government buildings. The Plan proposed a redesign of the National Mall {{and the construction of}} the future Burnham-designed Union Station. World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> the execution of the Plan, but construction of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922 largely completed it.|$|E

25|$|He {{remained}} at Glossop until January 1914, {{before returning to}} The Dell. He had failed to break back into the first team before the outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> his career. During the war he guested for West Ham United as well as turning out regularly for Southampton. Although he was offered terms to join West Ham {{at the end of}} the war, he decided to stay in Southampton where he had been offered a directorship with a firm of fruit importers.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, {{he chose}} a {{literary}} career, pursuing interests {{in the history of}} the Napoleonic Wars. [...] He wrote five books on the Wars, most of which are in use a century later. His studies of Napoleon's conquest of Prussia 1806–1807 (1901) and Napoleon's Campaign in Poland, 1806–1807 (1901) were among the first such books in the English language. [...] He also wrote several regimental histories, a study of Simon Bolivar, and a descriptive study of Colombia. World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> his literary pursuits; he served in the Finance Branch of the Ministry of Munitions. In 1920, Petre was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} two decades {{researchers}} made several attempts to isolate – as a potential treatment – whatever the islets produced. In 1906 George Ludwig Zuelzer achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the University of Chicago used aqueous pancreatic extracts, and noted [...] "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. Israel Kleiner demonstrated similar effects at Rockefeller University in 1915, but World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> his work and he did not return to it.|$|E

2500|$|In Napoleon's Last Campaign, Petre {{posits that}} the Emperor Napoleon {{abandoned}} the guiding principles {{of his previous}} success, which lay in his relentless pursuit of his opponent's main army. In the Saxon Campaign, Napoleon lost sight of his primary objectives, becoming mired in secondary achievements. Petre noted also the vast increase in sheer numbers, {{on both sides of}} the contest, and predicted that in terms of numbers, [...] "we must wait for the wars of tomorrow to see those numbers exceeded." [...] World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> his work as a military historian; he was recalled from retirement to work in the Finance office of the Munitions Ministry. On 26 March 1920, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912 Gulbenkian was {{the driving}} force behind the {{creation}} of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC)—a consortium of the largest European oil companies aimed at cooperatively procuring oil exploration and development rights in the Ottoman territory of Mesopotamia, while excluding other interests. [...] The German interests would be limited to a 25% share, with a 35% for the British, and the remaining for Gulbenkian to choose. [...] So, he gave Royal Dutch Shell 25% and kept 15% for himself as [...] "the conceiver, the founder, and the artisan of the Turkish Petroleum combine." [...] A promise of these rights was made to the TPC, but the onset of World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> their efforts. [...] At first, the British Foreign Office supported the d'Arcy group to gain a share and replace Calouste's share, but Gulbenkian worked closely with French concerns, arranged for the French to receive the German's share as part of the spoils of victory, [...] and, in return, the French protected his interest.|$|E
2500|$|Flooding {{overwhelmed}} northwestern Mississippi in 1912–1913, causing heavy {{damage to}} the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, {{on a scale of}} 2:1. Although U.S. participation in World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to [...] in the 1920s. Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which broke through the levees. There were losses {{of millions of dollars in}} property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including Washington and Bolivar counties.|$|E

2500|$|The orchestra's first {{concert was}} held in 1912 at Tonawama Hall in Burns. With funds {{provided}} by rancher Bill Hanley, lawyer and artist Charles Erskine Scott Wood, and additional Burns businessmen, Dodge purchased musical instruments {{for the children and}} expanded the orchestra to thirty to thirty-five members. By 1915, the orchestra was touring throughout Eastern Oregon on a Chautauqua circuit. With $2,000 in funds raised by the aforementioned businessmen, the ensemble visited Western Oregon in September 1916 and performed seven concerts within two days. Now known as the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra, the ensemble won $100 at the Oregon State Fair in Salem and performed several concerts in Portland, including one at the Imperial Hotel and one for opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink at the Portland Hotel. During the symphony's week-long tour, one Oregonian reporter wrote: [...] "The journey of the little people {{is considered one of the}} finest exhibitions of community spirit ever shown in this state." [...] Schumann-Heink planned to support the orchestra's efforts to tour, and promised to host a benefit concert the following year. However, the nation's involvement in World War <b>I</b> <b>interrupted</b> plans for additional tours. The orchestra disbanded in 1918 when Dodge relocated to Portland.|$|E
