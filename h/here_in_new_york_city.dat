And we raced over to a benefit for a guy named John Anderson, who is the Independent Party {{candidate}} for the presidency of the United States; and The Gun Club happened to be performing that night, over at this other place, and it was a blast! And this is for my friend, Jeffrey Lee Pierce.|$|E
50|$|Kelly {{was born}} on 6 February 1952 in New Ross, County Wexford, Republic of Ireland, to an Irish father and a Sicilian mother. In 1966 he emigrated to New York City where he worked pushing a hot dog cart, {{unloading}} barges, as well as doing a number of menial jobs. Eventually he fell into an apprenticeship as a sign writer. While there his mentor convinced him to finish secondary school and in 1971 he was offered an athletic scholarship in gymnastics to the City University of New York. It was <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> that he was first introduced to theatre and having a brief stint at acting became interested in writing. In 1972, through friends he had made in New York, he was offered a one year position as a coach for the Icelandic National Gymnastics Team. Following this he became a Hospital Corpsman in the US Navy and assisted, among other things, in the rescue efforts of Heimaey island, Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland following the volcanic eruption there, {{and later in the}} evacuation of Saigon in 1975 helping to resettle tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees to the city of Westminster, Orange County.Near the end of his naval enlistment Kelly enlisted in the U.S. Army, became an engineer and translator, and having gone through the Marine Force Recon course in Coronado California, applied and was accepted into Army Special Forces training.|$|E

40|$|Manifest destiny {{for all of}} the Americas, and {{especially}} for the vast lands that were included in Jefferson’s great purchase from Napoleon and that continu-ally haunted his own French and Rousseaulike thinking, has continually pre-sented a fascinating face in terms of labeling and terminology {{as well as in the}} tonal uses of language both as a tool for progress and as veil or mask for concealment. I open this paper with a convoluted sentence for a very German and Romantic notion: the West. Biographies of Adolf Hitler suggest that even he loved to read American Westerns in translation as well as the German imi-tators of our westerns; and his obsessive drive for lebensraum seems almost quintessentially American (Toland). But putting political correctness and moral concerns aside for the moment – if that can at all be done with good conscience <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> only three years after 9 / 11 – the historical and political tension used to talk about “American Empire ” from Jefferson and Alexander von Humboldt onward until our century, by which I mean still the 20 th century, also tells us much about epistemology and the practica...|$|E
40|$|In New York City {{and around}} the nation, there is intense {{interest}} in {{the question of what}} it takes to turn around a low-performing school. This study focused on two sets of initially low-performing NYC middle schools. The first group (the "turnaround schools") exhibited significant growth in academic performance between 2006 and 2010, while the other group saw minimal growth or remained stagnant during the same period. To gain an understanding of how the turnaround schools improved, researchers conducted in-depth interviews with principals and focus groups with teachers in both sets of schools. This report presents a rich picture of the conditions and strategies that enabled the turnaround schools to boost student achievement. Specifically, it identifies three interrelated "essential conditions" that were largely principal driven: aligning needs with goals, creating a positive work environment, and addressing student discipline and safety. These essential conditions, in turn, set the stage for implementing specific strategies to improve teaching and learning: developing teachers internally, creating small learning communities, targeting student sub-populations, and using data to inform instruction. The report also describes several ongoing challenges faced by all the schools. Finally, it draws on the study's findings to make recommendations for improving the effectiveness of middle schools <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> {{and around the}} country. The study is part of an ongoing focus on the middle grades for the Research Alliance...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{testimony}} presented to the New York City Council Select Committee on Information Technology in Government's hearing, "An Examination of New York City's E-Government Initiatives. " June 24, 2002 The Center for Technology in Government has been active in digital government research and experimentation since 1996 when we worked with a handful of New York State agencies to develop their very first web sites. Since that time, the Center has worked with scores of federal, state, and local government agencies, including some <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City.</b> These projects generated case studies, research reports, and practical guidelines on the strategies, policies, and technologies that contribute to effective e-government. We've also built e-government application prototypes, including one that is now the NYS Geographic Information System Clearinghouse. All of these experiences have provided a rich body of knowledge about the public service advances made possible by emerging information technologies. We have learned that the traditional problems organizations face when they adopt new technologies (and new ways of working) still remain [...] -and some new ones have entered the scene. I'd like to use my time with you this afternoon to outline a working definition of e-government, to present some of the overarching needs that government professionals face in creating e-government, and then to mention some effective practices that might serve as learning model...|$|E
