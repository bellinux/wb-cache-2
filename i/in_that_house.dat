5|$|The 1966 {{legislative}} session {{was much more}} successful for Breathitt. His economic development program, which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries, 57,000 new jobs, and more than $1billion in new plant investment, was recognized as the nation's best by the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $100million in state revenue. The pro-administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections, and Waterfield, Breathitt's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor, was stripped of much of his authority. Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate, providing effective leadership <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> of the General Assembly. Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations {{for most of the}} state's political districts. Wetherby's leadership was so effective that the budget passed both houses of the Assembly, virtually unchanged, by votes of 99–0 and 31–5 only ten days later.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earnings}} of The Bridge of San Luis Rey, in 1930 Wilder built a house for his family in Hamden, Connecticut. His sister Isabel lived there {{for the rest of}} her life.

25|$|The {{imbalance}} in representation <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>House</b> is apparent when considering population size. The six senators from BC constitute only {{one for every}} 775,000 people vs. one for every 75,000 in P.E.I. which has four senators. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have much smaller populations than BC, yet each has ten Senators according to a Global News summary. Correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment, but that {{is unlikely to be}} supported by the Atlantic Provinces.|$|E

While in the Senate, he and Reverdy Johnson were the only Democrats <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> {{to vote for the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to abolish slavery. After the Senate, he was appointed Minister to Austria, but his nomination was not confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with convention, the Governor-General, {{to maintain the}} stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain {{the support of the}} House of Representatives: usually the leader of the political party with a majority <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house,</b> but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority government situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to Cabinet the other ministers of the Crown, who are, in turn, accountable to the Parliament, and through it, to the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister {{and other members of the}} ministry, and she holds audience with her Australian ministers where possible.|$|E
25|$|Through many generations, it {{remained}} in the Taylor family until 1896, when Lucy W. Taylor sold the farm to George and William Bray, two brothers {{who had worked for}} the Taylors, and who were probably distant relatives. The property that Lucy sold for $400 included 50 acres (20 hectares) of uplands and adjacent marshlands which were capable of producing each year six tons of a combination of salt and fresh hay. The deed described the property as being in that part of Yarmouth known as Hockanom. It was sustained as a prosperous working farm by the Bray family until 1941. They continued to harvest salt marsh hay from Black Flat Marsh to feed their farm animals. The Brays often sold their strawberry and blueberry crops from a wheelbarrow on Old Kings Highway. In 1946 Robert J Williams purchased the farm and 88 acres for the tax due on the property. He moved from New Jersey to work for the Buzzards Bay Gas company until he retired. Robert Williams along with wife Katherin and son Robert Jr. lived on the farm and restored and improved the original farmhouse and surrounding land. They also improved the barn and a small apartment built {{into the side of the}} hill under the large ice-age boulder adjacent to the barn. Robert Williams introduced sheep to the farm and maintained them throughout his ownership. Although he worked a full-time job, he raised the sheep like the proud Welshman he was. He showed his sheep all over Massachusetts in county fairs. He sheared them and sold the wool. He also had several large vegetable gardens as well as wild and cultivated blueberries, and raspberries. The farm provided a great deal of food for the family. Robert Jr. built a home up the road for his new wife, and had a son <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> in the mid-1950s. Later he would move the family to south Yarmouth. The grandchildren would spend weekends on the farm up until the mid-1960s. The Williams family sold the farm they loved and cared for to a developer in the 1970s when Katherine became ill and could not keep up with the demands of the property. The terms stipulated that the farmhouse and barn be preserved. The Williams family saved the farm from destruction in the 1940s and in the 1970s. By the late 1980s, ownership changed hands a number of times, and the buildings saw neglect.|$|E

500|$|Whenever necessary, the Monarch is {{responsible}} for appointing a new Prime Minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other Minister of the Crown, and thereby constitutes and controls the government).

As dogs are not allowed in the residential park where they are staying, they take Lad to a kennel, but he quickly escapes {{and returns to the}} park. While waiting for the Master and Mistress to wake up, he follows a strange scent through a neighbor's house, leading to his being blamed for destroying a room <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house.</b> However, it's quickly discovered that the vandal was another neighbor's pet monkey, hidden by its owner who did not like the park's new [...] "no pet" [...] rules.

500|$|The {{land that}} Van Cortlandt Park now {{occupies}} {{was acquired by}} Van Cortlandt from Philipse in the mid-to-late 1690s. In 1699, Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook in order to power a sawmill (and later, a gristmill), creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process. In 1732, Van Cortlandt acquired an additional parcel from the Tippett family. The estate was then passed on to Jacobus's son Frederick Van Cortlandt (1699–1749) and family in 1739; it was once a vast grain plantation. [...] In 1748, Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the former Tippett property, but died before its completion. The Van Cortlandts did not primarily live <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>house,</b> instead staying in Manhattan most of the time. [...] A family burial ground was created in 1749, later {{to be known as}} [...] "Vault Hill." [...] Frederick, who was buried in Vault Hill, [...] had willed the massive home and surrounding lands to his son, James Van Cortlandt (1727–1787).|$|E

[...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor.
