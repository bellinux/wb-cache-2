40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} the sensitivity and specificity of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) total scores in detecting conscious awareness. DesignData were retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients enrolled in a specialized Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) program. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were completed using CRS-R-derived diagnoses of Minimally Conscious State (MCS) or Emerged from Minimal Conscious State (EMCS) as the reference standard for conscious awareness and the total CRS-R score as the 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 test criterion 22 ̆ 0 ac?. A receiver operating curve (ROC) was constructed to demonstrate the optimal CRS-R total cut-off score for maximizing sensitivity and specificity. SettingSpecialized DoC programParticipants 252 patients enrolled in the DoC program (157 male; mean age = 49 years; mean time from injury = 48 days; traumatic etiology= 127, non-traumatic etiology= 125; diagnosis of coma or VS= 72, diagnosis of MCS or EMCS= 182) InterventionsNot applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s) Sensitivity and specificity of CRS-R total scores in detecting conscious awarenessResultsA CRS-R total score of 10 or higher yielded a sensitivity of 0. 78 for correct identification of patients in MCS or EMCS, and specificity of 1. 00 for correct identification of patients who did not meet criteria for either of these <b>diagnoses</b> (<b>i.</b> e., <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> VS or coma).

40|$|The {{sequelae}} of maltreatment are conceptualized {{according to}} the DSM IV multiaxial system expanded for heuristic purposes. Axis I and Axis IV are expanded {{to take into account}} important variables of maltreatment. Differential Axis <b>I</b> <b>diagnoses</b> <b>are</b> identified <b>with</b> special emphasis placed on PTSD, Dissociation, Depression and Disruptive Behavior Disorders. Axes II and III are heuristically expanded to call attention to developmental psychopathology, particularly in the domains of conscience, and associated putative neurobiological sequelae of maltreatment, indicating a pathway to the psychobiology of conscience. Conscience sensitive assessment of maltreated children is illustrated with two case vignettes and selected conscience drawings. A ‘transaxial,’ conscience sensitive approach to DSM nosology is recommended as a corrective. There will likely be additional implications for the psychobiology of conscience as neuroimaging and assessment of conscience functions in health and psychopathology become more refined.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{retrospective}} chart {{review was}} conducted to determine if nutritional source of feeding and/or infant age at diagnosis of cystic fibrosis had any effect on nutritional status and subsequent growth accretion. Additionally, {{an attempt was made}} to identify predictors for poor growth in patients with undiagnosed cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Data was collected from medical and clinic charts at Primary Children 2 ̆ 7 s Medical Center (PCMC), Salt Lake City, Utah, for subjects born between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 200 <b>I,</b> who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis before 1 year of age. Thirty-one subjects met inclusion parameters. These subjects were divided into two groups: an 2 ̆ 2 early 2 ̆ 2 diagnosis group (N= 13) included those who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> before 9 weeks of age, and a 2 ̆ 2 late 2 ̆ 2 diagnosis group (N= 18) included those who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> after 9 weeks of age. 2 ̆ 2 Breastfed at diagnosis 2 ̆ 2 (N= 7) and 2 ̆ 2 not breastfed at diagnosis 2 ̆ 2 (N= 17) groups were established as well, with nutritional source of feeding remaining unknown for 7 of the 31 subjects. RESULTS: Paired t-tests indicated that children who were primarily breastfed at time of diagnosis did not grow significantly more than children who were formula-fed at time of diagnosis, although regression analysis indicated that nutritional source of feeding at time of diagnosis {{was a significant predictor of}} growth later in life. This contradiction could have come about due to the small sample size. Age at diagnosis had a significant effect on growth, at diagnosis, at age 2 years, and age 6 years. Children who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> early grew taller and weighed more than the children who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> after 9 weeks of age, both at the 2 -year mark and at the 6 - year mark. Additionally, low blood albumin levels at diagnosis were predictive of more growth at age 2 years and 6 years. Other identified predictors of growth included gender, age at diagnosis, and whether the child had a family history of cystic fibrosis. This research highlights the crucial need for early detection and correction of malnutrition in infants and children with cystic fibrosis. It should be viewed as a pilot study, with more research needed in this area...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our study {{aimed at}} (1) {{evaluating}} neonatal treatment and outcome of neonates {{with either a}} prenatal or a postnatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia (EA) and (2) analyzing the impact of prenatal diagnosis on outcome based {{on the type of}} EA. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a population-based study using data from the French National Register for infants with EA born from 2008 - 2010. We compared prenatal, maternal, and neonatal characteristics among children with prenatal vs postnatal diagnosis and EA types I and III. We defined a composite variable of morbidity (anastomotic esophageal leaks, recurrent fistula, stenosis) and death at 1 year. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-nine live births with EA were recorded with a prenatal diagnosis rate of 24. 3 %; 82. 2 % of EA type <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> prenatally compared <b>with</b> 17. 9 % of EA type III (P <. 001). Transfer after birth was lower in case of prenatal diagnosis (25. 6 % vs 82. 5 %; P <. 001). The delay between birth and first intervention did not differ significantly among groups. The defect size was longer among the prenatal diagnosis group (2. 61 vs 1. 48 cm; P <. 001). The composite variables were higher in prenatal diagnosis subset (44 % vs 27. 6 %; P =. 003) and in EA type I than in type III (58. 1 % vs 28. 3 %; P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Despite the excellent survival rate of EA, cases with antenatal detection have a higher morbidity rate related to the EA type (type I and/or long gap). Even though it does not modify neonatal treatment and the 1 -year outcome, prenatal diagnosis allows antenatal parental counselling and avoids postnatal transfers...|$|R
