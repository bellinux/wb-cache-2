25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E

500|$|In the {{creation}} of the logo, Huff was inspired by the personal crests of Samurai families. [...] In a book he’d been given, We Japanese, he found pages of crests, including the crane. [...] On his choice of the crane, he writes: [...] "I had faith that it was the perfect symbol for Japan Air Lines. [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Crane myth was all positive—it mates for life (loyalty), and flies high for miles without tiring (strength.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|Given its reputation, Jerry Huff, an American {{branding}} expert, recommended it as {{the international}} logo of Japan Airlines, after seeing a representation {{of it in a}} gallery of samurai crests.

2500|$|Contrary to Chomsky and Herman, {{the reports}} of massive Khmer Rouge atrocities and {{starvation}} in Cambodia proved to be accurate and uninflated. Many deniers or doubters of the Cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but Chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of Cambodia was without error {{based on the information}} available to him at the time. [...] Herman addressed critics in 2001: [...] "Chomsky and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very asking of questions about...the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975–1979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for Pol Pot'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research by Ludwik and Hanka Herschfeld during World War <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{frequencies}} of blood groups A, B and O differed greatly from region to region. The [...] "O" [...] blood type (usually {{resulting from the}} absence of both A and B alleles) is very common around the world, with a rate of 63% in all human populations. Type [...] "O" [...] is the primary blood type among the indigenous populations of the Americas, in-particular within Central and South America populations, with a frequency of nearly 100%. In indigenous North American populations the frequency of type [...] "A" [...] ranges from 16% to 82%. This suggests again that the initial Amerindians evolved from an isolated population with a minimal number of individuals.|$|E
2500|$|However {{often this}} tale has been reiterated, {{it is not}} beyond doubt. Dale himself {{said that it was}} handed down in University College, and showed some {{surprise}} that the constriction of the radial artery was measurable. Of Oliver’s descendants, none recalled experiments on his son. [...] Dale’s report of subcutaneous injections contradicts the concerned parties. Oliver: “During the winter of 1893–4, while prosecuting an inquiry as to … agents that vary the calibre of … arteries … <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> administration by the mouth of a glycerine extract of the adrenals of the sheep and calf produced a marked constrictive action on the arteries.” Schäfer: “In the autumn of 1893 there called upon me in my laboratory in University College a gentleman who was personally unknown to me. … I found that my visitor was Dr. George Oliver, [...] was desirous of discussing with me the results which he had been obtaining from the exhibition by the mouth of extracts from certain animal tissues, and the effects which these had in his hands produced upon the blood vessels of man.” Systemic effects of orally given adrenaline are highly unlikely. So details of the canonical text may be legend.|$|E

40|$|Every year, {{approximately}} 17 500 drunk {{drivers are}} sued in Sweden. Of these, only 10 percent are women. The women are therefore considered a minority.
