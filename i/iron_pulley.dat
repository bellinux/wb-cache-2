25|$|Covered wagons {{pulled by}} oxen were common, {{particularly}} in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the Nauvoo Neighbor printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15lb of <b>iron,</b> <b>pulleys</b> and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, {{just east of the}} Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.|$|R

60|$|Our path {{had been}} {{gradually}} rising {{all the way}} from St. Clare's Well; and, when we left Trevethey Stone, we still continued to ascend, proceeding along the tram-way leading to the Caraton Mine. Soon the scene presented another abrupt and extraordinary change. We had been walking hitherto amid almost invariable silence and solitude; but now, with each succeeding minute, strange, mingled, unintermitting noises began to grow louder and louder around us. We followed a sharp curve in the tram-way, and immediately found ourselves saluted by an entirely new prospect, and surrounded by an utterly bewildering noise. All about us monstrous wheels were turning slowly; machinery was clanking and groaning in the hoarsest discords; invisible waters were pouring onward with a rushing sound; high above our heads, on skeleton platforms, iron chains clattered fast and fiercely over <b>iron</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and huge steam pumps puffed and gasped, and slowly raised and depressed their heavy black beams of wood. Far beneath the embankment on which we stood, men, women, and children were breaking and washing ore in a perfect marsh of copper-coloured mud and copper-coloured water. We had penetrated to the very centre of the noise, the bustle, and the population on the surface of a great mine.|$|R

Departed from Sydney with general cargo for Broadsound; and ran aground on Lady Musgrave Is; maybe on Heron Is or One Tree Island or Masthead Reef Lost on a reef off Heron Island {{on the night of}} 17 December 1868. The crew took to the boat and safely reached the pilot station at Keppel Island.The vessel was {{originally}} stated as having hit at Lady Musgrave reef (most unlikely) later news reports claim wreck on Heron Island with some other reports mention the wreck on either One Tree Island or Mast Head.The vessel was built in 1861 at Ulladulla New South Wales and registered in Sydney with the Official number of 36858 and a Registered number of 9/1861 with a gross tonnage of 80 tons and 82 feet in length.From the original reportsOne of the boats dispatched to the wreck of the Jane Lockhart, schooner, has returned with the sails and a portion of the running and standing gear. The vessel, it appears, did not strike on Bunkers Group, as reported by Captain Machen, but upon what is known as Heron Island, about ninety miles to the northward of Bunkers Group. When the boat reached the vessel she was settled in a hollow in one of the reefs, the outer formation of the hollow acting as a breakwater against the seas. One side of the vessel was quite visible, and the new copper sheathing appeared uninjured. Captain Norris, who went down in charge of the boat, unbent the sails, so that the position of the vessel might as much as possible remain unaltered; he left the yards and masts standing.and 6 months later it was reported asThe Rose, schooner, has returned from the wreck of the Jane Lockhart, on Masthead Reef, whither she went on June 15 Captain Dwyer informs us that the Jane Lockhart still lies in a very snug position, and he has no doubt but that himself, and Mr Norris, the purchaser of the wreck, will be able, ultimately, to raise the vessel and bring her safely to RockhamptonNearly the whole of the period that they were at the reef, very heavy weather prevailed, staving operations towards the recovery of the cargo, but luckily the strong SE winds lulled for about three days Captain Dwyer availed himself of the occasion, set to work, rigged up a staging between the masts of the Lockhart, schooner, and by means of a rope and a South Sea Island diver, managed to bring up from eighty to ninety large <b>iron</b> <b>pulley</b> wheels, besides a quantity of machinery and sundries, comprising Ale, porter, liqueur brandy, cutlery, ironmongery, etc Unfortunately the Roses water ran out, much to the chagrin of the crew, who would have raised a great deal more, only having to run into port for supplies ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{the casting}} process of pulley {{is a hot}} and {{difficult}} topic in industry. As {{the production of the}} nodular cast <b>iron</b> <b>pulley</b> requires chill for final feeding in the traditional casting technology. To avoid the cold iron in casting process, this paper presents a new technology for 50 - 60017 - 00 type pulley. Simulated results, obtained from commercial software "MAGMA", indicate that liquid metal fills the sand smoothly, and no porosity is found in the casting. Then, 20 pieces of samples were produced to test the performance, validating the proposed technology. Finally, the results could be applied to other designs of nodular cast <b>iron</b> <b>pulley</b> process...|$|E
5000|$|The EBT {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} a complete, {{original}} railroad rather than a collection of pieces from various locations, as most tourist railroads are. All six of the [...] narrow gauge steam locomotives that operated on the railroad in its last years as a coal hauler are still on site, and some are used for the excursion trains. Other original equipment includes a [...] switcher steam locomotive (non-operational), operating track-gang cars, the M-3 motorcar (built from scratch by the EBT with an engine and transmission from an automobile), and the M-1, a motorcar (doodlebug) based on scaled-down J. G. Brill and Company plans built by the EBT in 1927. The majority of rolling stock that operated on the railroad in its later coal-hauling years remains on the property in varying condition, including over a dozen flatcars, several boxcars and well over 150 hoppers. Tourist trains use original EBT passenger equipment, as well as converted EBT freight cars. The original railroad maintenance shops have a pair of Babcock & Wilcox boilers, a 19th-century stationary steam engine, and an overhead line shaft system (steel shafts, wood and <b>iron</b> <b>pulleys</b> and leather and canvas belts) that powers antique machine tools, sheet-forming machines, foundry equipment, blacksmithing tools and woodworking machines. Most all 33 mi of the railroad's original main 30 mile line is still in place, though only 5 mi are currently used. In recent years disused trackage from Rockhill Furnace southward and Robertsdale southward have been cleared and gauged for use with speeders and handcars (track-gang cars).|$|R

40|$|As {{the global}} {{population}} rises, food security {{is among the}} most important grand challenges of our time. While agriculture has significantly developed in parts of the world, other parts are severely underdeveloped, inhibiting agriculture productivity, which is a necessary component of the solution to the food security challenge. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in particular, has seen little growth in productivity, something that has been correlated to its low agricultural mechanization. One barrier to mechanization in SSA, where the average farm size is less than 2 Ha, is the cost of farm equipment. This leaves many farmers with just basic tools to perform farm operations. Threshing is a critical part of processing grains, which are staple crops in most countries. Traditional methods of threshing are time and energy consuming and can result in significant grain losses. Threshers that are available are imported, expensive, or too large for most farms. This thesis investigated a locally appropriate and sustainable multigrain threshing machine as a means of improving the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers in SSA. An axial-flow threshing machine was designed for the threshing and cleaning of maize and soybeans. The thresher was 5. 2 ft (1. 6 m) long, 4. 3 ft (1. 3 m) high and 1. 4 ft (0. 4 m) wide. At an engine speed of 3000 rpm, the drum had a peripheral speed of 39 ft/s (12 m/s), the sieve oscillated at 10 Hz, and air speed at the fan outlet was 29 ft/s (8. 9 m/s). To simplify local manufacturing and minimize costs, only basic parts and materials, like rebar, angle <b>iron,</b> and <b>pulleys,</b> were used in the thresher. Tests of the thresher were performed using pre-weighed stalks of soybeans or un-husked corncobs. The crop was run through the thresher, and afterwards, weights of the grain and material other than grain (MOG) were measured in four different locations: on the ground, in the thresher, out the cylinder discharge, and in the grain bin. After initial tests, minor modifications were made to the thresher, and final tests were conducted. The final results showed that 96 % of corn and 94 % of soybeans were collected in the grain bin, with MOG amounts of 1. 3 % and 6. 6 % respectively. The feeding of material into the thresher, not the power or threshing capacity of the machine, restricted the feed rates. Grain feed rates of over 200 kg/h (corn) and over 20 kg/h (soybeans) were achieved. The results have demonstrated strong potential for the machine to be manufactured and used in SSA as a labor saving device for smallholder farmers to increase productivity and decrease losses. ...|$|R
