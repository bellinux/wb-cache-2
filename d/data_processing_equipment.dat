Cellular solid structures have great impact on sensory properties and associated with also textural-mechanical properties. XMT is able to present rigorous quantitative information related to cellular architecture of solid foods such as cell size and distribution, cell wall thickness, cell connectedness and porosity both in 2 D and 3 D. The accurate microstructural characterization of cellular solid foods would also help food engineers and scientists to understand and develop links between structure–mechanical–sensory properties. Based on these {{and the use of}} numerical simulation technologies together with modelling approaches can be used to design novel food structures and textures.

40|$|Surface {{waves are}} {{commonly}} used for vibration-based nondestructive testing for infrastructure. Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) {{has been used to}} detect subsurface properties for geologic inspections. Recently, efforts were made to scale down these subsurface detection approaches to see how they perform on small-scale structures such as concrete slabs and pavements. Additional efforts have been made to replace the traditional surface-mounted transducers with non-contact acoustic transducers. Though some success has been achieved, most of these new approaches are inefficient because they require point-to-point measurements or off-line signal analysis. This article introduces a Mobile Acoustic Subsurface Sensing system as MASS, which is an improved surface wave based implementation for measuring the subsurface profile of roadways. The compact MASS system is a 3 -wheeled cart outfitted with an electromagnetic impact source, distance register, non-contact acoustic sensors and <b>data</b> acquisition/ <b>processing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The key advantage of the MASS system is the capability to collect measurements continuously at walking speed in an automatic way.
