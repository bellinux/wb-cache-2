25|$|After {{graduating from}} Bryant High School in 1924, Merman {{was hired as}} a stenographer by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> break, she met Vic Kliesrath, who offered her a job at the Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation for a $5 {{increase}} above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer. She was eventually made personal secretary to company president Caleb Bragg, whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous night when she was out late performing at private parties. During this period, Merman also began appearing in nightclubs, first hired by Jimmy Durante's partner Lou Clayton. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.|$|E

As he prepares to fix <b>her</b> <b>lunch,</b> he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue, intending to surreptitiously feeding it to her, as he has many times before. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting. Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words on a screen, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} {{as part of}} the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–01) and was written by writing partners John Frink and Don Payne. [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] was the first episode of the show directed by Lauren MacMullan, who joined the staff of The Simpsons following the cancellation of the short-lived television series Mission Hill, which was created by former Simpsons writers and executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein on which she worked as a supervising director and designer. American actress and stand-up comedian Kathy Griffin guest starred in the episode as the bully Francine. MacMullan designed this new character herself and tried to make her seem like a professional bully by having her carry <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> box with her all the time like a briefcase.|$|E
50|$|Fuskova was {{the first}} woman who came out and openly {{declared}} that she was a lesbian on Argentine television.

Fuskova was married; she has three children.|$|R

500|$|Henry hired Swiss {{troops to}} help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up {{barricades}} {{in the streets and}} refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise. When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, [...] "Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape." [...] As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.|$|E
500|$|Her {{control over}} the text is less certain. Her staff claim she reads {{everything}} written for publication, but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, read any of Vogues arts coverage or book reviews. Earlier in her career, she often left writing of the text that accompanied her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area. Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor's letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself. She often turns her mobile phone off in order to eat <b>her</b> <b>lunch,</b> usually a steak (or bunless hamburger), undisturbed. High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. [...] "It was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs every single day" [...] for lunch, says a coworker at Harpers & Queen. [...] "She would eat nothing else." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{city manager}} Chris Traeger tries to remove red {{meat from the}} city hall {{cafeteria}} {{as part of a}} government-wide health initiative in [...] "Soulmates," [...] Ron intervenes by challenging Chris to a cook-off. Chris agrees to abandon his plan if Ron's regular hamburgers are deemed better than his lean meat turkey burgers. Although Ron exerts little effort compared to Chris, his burgers easily win the contest. In [...] "Road Trip," [...] Ron reluctantly agrees to be interviewed by a young girl for her school assignment, during which he explains his libertarian beliefs about small government, and illustrates the concept of taxes by eating 40percent of <b>her</b> <b>lunch.</b> The two bond, and he ends the day by giving her a claymore landmine as a gift. Ron gets in trouble the next day when the girl's mother explains her daughter's assignment was [...] "Why Government Matters," [...] and that Lauren simply wrote [...] "It doesn't." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", {{the lead}} single and first {{track of the}} album, was mainly written by Lohan as a letter to her father, Michael Lohan, who was incarcerated in June 2005 after {{surviving}} a car crash {{for which he was}} charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Additional writing and song production was done by Greg Wells and Kara DioGuardi, who revealed, [...] "If you solo the vocals you'll hear race cars, because we brought the studio to [...] trailer on [...] I'm not kidding! She had no time to do the record, so she would be on <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> break, and I'd be like, 'Throw that thing down your throat and get over here, 'cause we got to finish these vocals!' So I sat for 14 hours on the set and would grab her for, like, 10 minutes at a time. The poor girl. That's the reality of young Hollywood. When they're hot, they're worked to death. It was 18/20-hour days. ... And I swear: 'Vroom! Vroom!' You can hear it in the back." [...] "My Innocence" [...] is also about the singer's father. Lohan also covered [...] "I Want You to Want Me" [...] by Cheap Trick and [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] by Stevie Nicks for the album.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{complimentary}} {{towards the}} episode, praising the acting talent of January Jones and the ensemble cast {{as well as}} Jon Hamm's debut in the director's chair. Some, however, were not as impressed by the fat suit techniques used on January Jones to both hide her pregnancy and convey the character's weight gain. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He felt {{that some of the}} scenes were too on-the-nose and that some of the symbolism was a little overt. VanDerWerff specifically cited the scenes where Don talks with the young girl at the concert as on-the-nose, comparing Don in this scene to Joe Friday. He did, however, praise the subplot involving Betty's weight gain as well as the final scene. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said that all of the stories were linked by the threat of replacement and liked the interaction between Roger and Peggy, which he felt was a rare occurrence. He said that it was too soon to judge the Ginsberg character and that the Betty storyline was the weakest of the main plots. Writer Myles McNutt found January Jones [...] "highly compelling" [...] and the storyline offering a [...] "decidedly human turn for the character, with <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> with Joyce offering insight that we are robbed of without Betty having any friends to confide in normally." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among the [...] "firsts" [...] by Marshall Field's was {{the concept}} of the {{department}} store tea room. In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having lunch at a downtown restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field's clerk shared <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> (a chicken pot pie) with a tired shopper, Field's hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete their shopping. To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring's chicken pot pie.|$|E

She dropped <b>her</b> <b>lunch,</b> a bowl of chili, onto the boys and was suspended for six days. Two months later, after more confrontation, Brown was suspended {{for the rest of the}} school year. She transferred to New Lincoln High School in New York City. As depicted in the 1981 made-for-TV docudrama Crisis at Central High, and as mentioned by Melba Pattillo Beals in Warriors Don't Cry, white students were punished only when their offense was [...] "both egregious and witnessed by an adult".

2500|$|Bazlen {{was born}} in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Her father was Arthur Bazlen, a retail chain executive, and her mother was Maggie Daly, a {{newspaper}} columnist with Chicago's American (Chicago Today & Chicago Tribune). Maggie Daly was, with her three sisters, one of what Time magazine referred to as “the celebrated Daly sisters,” who were known for their writing and work in journalism, fashion and advertising. Life magazine ran two feature stories on the sisters with a young Bazlen appearing in the second. Columnist Maggie ("Daly Diary" [...] in Chicago's American), the oldest sister, a one-time model was known for <b>her</b> <b>lunch</b> time Chicago fashion shows and as a radio and television talk show guest and TV show host. Kay Daly, who worked in advertising with such people as Richard Avedon, became a Revlon vice president responsible for its advertising. Novelist and writer Maureen Daly became famous for writing Seventeenth Summer at age 19. Sheila Daly, the youngest, who wrote a Chicago Tribune teen column beginning {{at a very young}} age, eventually went into advertising as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{covers for}} the third volume of The Invisibles were [...] "done on the computer," [...] in part because [...] "Vertigo were paying for [...] "painted" [...] covers and [...] felt [...] had to deliver {{something}} more than line and flat color." [...] The experimental nature of the twelve covers was assisted by the fact that, says Bolland [...] "neither I nor Shelly had seen that issue's script." [...] For the trade paperback covers, Bolland [...] "was determined to make each one weirder than the last," [...] and so created a Francis Bacon inspired [...] "fleshy mass [...] with a typewriter" [...] for Entropy in the UK. Having convinced Karen Berger (Editor in chief of Vertigo) and Shelly Roeberg {{that it was a}} good idea, the artist recalls that [...] "Shelly rang up and, rather than telling me how wonderful I was, said that when she saw it she nearly lost <b>her</b> <b>lunch!</b> I was asked to turn his skin color from flesh to blue to tone him down a bit." [...] For the final Invisible Kingdom TPB cover, Bolland produced [...] "a cover containing 12 small alternative Invisibles covers," [...] which [...] "took a long time to do."
