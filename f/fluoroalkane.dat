It has been speculated that the fluoropentane might function as an alkylating agent or is further metabolized into toxic fluoroacetic acid.

This bond can be relatively weak (in {{the case of an}} iodoalkane) or quite stable (as {{in the case of a}} <b>fluoroalkane).</b> In general, with the exception of fluorinated compounds, haloalkanes readily undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions or elimination reactions. The substitution on the carbon, the acidity of an adjacent proton, the solvent conditions, etc. all can influence the outcome of the reactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, iodine {{transfer}} polymerization uses a mono- or diiodo-perfluoroalkane as {{the initial}} chain transfer agent.

The {{energy of the}} iodine-perfluoroalkane bond is low and, in contrast to iodo-hydrocarbon bonds, its polarization small. [...] Therefore, the iodine is easily abstracted {{in the presence of}} free radicals. Upon encountering an iodoperfluoroalkane, a growing poly(fluoroolefin) chain will abstract the iodine and terminate, leaving the now-created perfluoroalkyl radical to add further monomer. But the iodine-terminated poly(fluoroolefin) itself acts as a chain transfer agent. As in RAFT processes, as long as the rate of initiation is kept low, the net result is the formation of a monodisperse molecular weight distribution.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the study of}} fluorinated molecules is justified by the innumerous ap-plications that these compounds are founding in many diverse and interesting areas as a consequence of their unusual properties. They are being used as substitutes for chlori-nated solvents, surfactants in supercritical solvents, environmental probes, and in numer-ous biomedical applications. The choice of the best <b>fluoroalkane</b> to be used for a given application depends on its properties and in some cases, such as in biomedical applica-tions, that choice has to be precise. Thus, the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of these compounds is of extreme importance as well as the ability to describe and predict them at different conditions using thermodynamic models. In this work, the soft-SAFT EoS is used to describe the solubility of gases as oxygen, xenon and radon in saturated and substituted perfluoroalkanes.

The multi-vicinal fluorine motif is new in organic chemistry and therefore stereoselective methods giving rapid access to these motifs and with flexibility need to be explored. The research in the thesis succeeded in the preparation of (2 S, 3 R, 4 S) - 314 and (2 S, 3 S, 4 R) - 328. In Chapter 1, an overview of the impact of fluorine in organic molecules is given. Recent developments in asymmetric electrophilic and nucleophilic fluorination are described, as well as the preparation of multivicinal <b>fluoroalkane</b> motifs. Aldol reactions of either (R) - or (S) -N-(α-fluoropropyl) - 2 -oxazolidinones, mediated by TiCl 4 are reported in Chapter 2. Such aldol reactions gave rise to identical α-fluoro-β-hydroxy- aldol products with high diastereoselectivities (95 % dr). After removal from the auxiliary α- fluoro-β-hydroxy- products were converted to the corresponding α,β-difluoro products. The synthesis of non symmetric vicinal trifluoro motifs (2 S, 3 R, 4 S) - 314 and (2 S, 3 S, 4 R) - 328 is described in Chapter 3. They were prepared by direct fluorination in three steps of the corresponding (2 R, 3 R, 4 R) -erythro and (2 R, 3 S, 4 S) -threo enantio-enriched epoxy-alcohols.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{research}} is the vibrational Feshbach resonance (VFR) mechanism for positron annihilation on molecules below the threshold for positronium formation. This process results in resonances in the positron-molecule annihilation rate when the incident positron has energy [epsilon]=[omega]v - [epsilon]b, where [omega]v is the energy of a molecular vibration and [epsilon]b is the positron-molecule binding energy. To understand this process, annihilation rates are measured {{as a function of}} positron energy for a variety of molecular species. These experiments provide new insight into the VFR process. In small molecules, the annihilation spectrum can be described well by a recent theory, which was brought to fruition with the assistance of data presented here. It is shown that the magnitudes of the VFR resonances in these molecules depend only on a simple scaling factor g = [sqroot][epsilon]b/[epsilon]. This theory fails in larger molecules, where the magnitudes of annihilation resonances rise rapidly with molecular size. However in hydrocarbons, when the scaling factor g is normalized out, the resonance due to the C-H stretch mode follows a universal scaling with the number of vibrational degrees of freedom. This is interpreted as evidence that the VFR are being enhanced by intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR). To date, only <b>fluoroalkane</b> molecules deviate from this trend, exhibiting a suppression of annihilation above a certain energy threshold. It is demonstrated that a resonant inelastic process involving the C-F stretch mode is responsible for this behavior. Data are presented for a number of deeply bound species and compared to molecules of similar size. The relationship between binding energy and various physical parameters is explored. A number of other phenomena are discussed, including the observation of combination-mode VFR, providing added insight into the annihilation proces...|$|E
40|$|Hyper-cross-linked, hybrid {{membranes}} {{consist of}} covalent networks of alternating organic and inorganic, or biological groups. This thesis {{reports on the}} preparation of such hybrid networks via interfacial polymerization. The structure-property relationships of the hybrid networks depend strongly on the type, size and flexibility of the constituents. The collection of polymers that can be synthesized via interfacial polymerization includes polyamides, polyurethanes, polyureas, polyanilines, polyimides, and polycarbonates. In addition, the technique {{can be used to}} prepare defect-free, ultrathin films of metal organic frameworks, organic-inorganic hybrids, and bio-hybrids. Here, inorganic-organic network materials based on polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) that are covalently bound by imide bridges have been prepared. The membranes are characterized by a high degree of cross-linking, {{as a result of the}} large number of functional groups on the POSS cages. Even at temperatures up to 300 °C, macromolecular dynamics of the hybrid networks based on short imide bridges is limited. This is illustrated by the relatively small shrinkage during heat treatment of the poly[POSS-(amic acid) ] precursors and the high permselectivities in gas separation applications at a broad temperature range. Poly(POSS imide) s with long, flexible imide bridges display a higher degree of network flexibility. The flexibility of the hybrid network materials prepared with relatively long imide bridges is reflected by the unique sorption behavior of <b>fluoroalkane</b> based poly(POSS-imide). The membrane layers sorb large amounts of CO 2 and CH 4, up to an extent that the molar volume of the adsorbed gas exceeds that of the liquid molar volume of these gases. The interfacial polymerization method used for the inorganic-organic networks has been extended towards biological hybrids. The preparation of all-protein layers that consist of enzymatically active and fluorescently active films is reported. The broad applicability of interfacial polymerization for the preparation of ultrathin hybrid films provide prospect for further development of materials with unique functionalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{calculation}} {{of the effect of}} a linear electric field of a polar substituent on proton chemical shifts based on partial atomic charges is shown to give a complete account of fluorine SCS in rigid molecules for all long range protons (> three bonds). A value of the linear electric field coefficient AZ of 3. 67 × 10 212 esu (63 ppm au) is obtained. For vicinal protons (H?C?C?F) the electric field calculation is accurate for monofluorine substitution but considerably overestimates the effects for difluoro (CF 2) and trifluoro (CF 3) substituents. A model based on fluorine polarisability and correcting for di- and tri-fluoro substituents gives good agreement with the observed SCS. The combined scheme predicts the proton chemical shifts of a variety of <b>fluoroalkanes</b> over 60 data points spanning ca. 6 ppm with an rms error of 0. 11 ppm. The compounds include <b>fluoroalkanes,</b> cyclohexanes, bornanes, norboranes and steroids.

40|$|The work {{contained}} within this thesis {{is a study}} of inclusion compounds using solid-state NMR. Such compounds typically exhibit static and/or dynamic disorder, which precludes the use of diffraction-based techniques to obtain detailed structural information.

However, the dynamic nature of the guest molecules within inclusion compounds can yield unusual results for routinely applied experiments, such as cross polarisation, heteronuclear dipolar decoupling and dipolar dephasing. Therefore, some of the more fundamental aspects of solid-state NMR have first been explored. The inclusion compounds of particular interest are those which contain urea or thiourea as the host species. The ordering of guest molecules and host dynamics have been investigated via both one- and two-dimensional (^ 13) C and (^ 1) H NMR experiments for the 2 -hydroxyalkane/urea inclusion compounds. For the 1 -fluorotetradecane/urea inclusion compound, an approach involving a combination of (^ 1) H→(^ 13) C and (^ 19) F→(^ 13) C cross-polarisation experiments, with both single-channel (^H) and double-channel decoupling ((^ 1) H,(^ 19) F) has been devised to assign (^ 13) C resonances and hence deduce guest ordering. Steady-state and transient (^ 19) F MAS NOE experiments have been used to probe the dynamics of the 1 -fluorotetradecane/urea inclusion compound. Using the considerable sensitivity advantage of (^ 19) F NMR, over that of (^ 13) C, a detailed study of the conformational dynamics exhibited by fluorocyclohexane molecules included within thiourea has been performed via bandshape analysis, selective polarisation inversion and 2 D exchange experiments.

40|$|The {{properties}} of a polymer surface {{can be manipulated}} {{by the addition of}} a small quantity of surface active functionalised polymer to the bulk. On annealing above the glass transition these low surface energy functional groups attach to the air/polymer interface forming a brush like layer. To quantify this effect perdeuterated polystyrenes with <b>fluoroalkane</b> groups at specific locations in the polymer have been blended with unmodified polystyrene. Three key areas have been studied; effect of molecular architecture; effect of the molecular weight of the matrix polymer; and the rate of formation of the segregating layer. The complementary techniques of neutron reflectometry and nuclear reaction analysis have been used to determine the near surface depth profile of the deuterated polymer. Architectures studied were linear polystyrene with functional groups {{at both ends of the}} polymer chain, a 3 -armed star with a functional core and linear polystyrene with functional groups evenly spaced along the chain. The architecture affected the shape of the composition profile but had little effect on the surface volume fraction and surface excess values obtained for the same bulk volume fraction. Self-consistent field theory simulations were carried out to determine the 'sticking energy' of the functional groups and good comparisons were obtained between the experimental volume fraction profiles and those predicted. Some segregation of functional polymer was observed during sample preparation and equilibrium segregation was obtained in less than one hour for 50000 M(_W) linear polymer up to eight hours for the 3 -armed star after annealing under vacuum at 413 K.

Scanning tunneling microscopy {{has been used as}} a powerful tool for the visualization of molecules in real space on a conducting substrate surface. For more than a decade, we have been investigating the self-assembly of a series of triangle-shaped phenyleneethynylene macrocycles called dehydrobenzo[12]annulenes (DBAs). These molecules are substituted with six alkyl chains and are capable of forming hexagonal porous 2 D molecular networks via van der Waals interactions between interdigitated alkyl chains at the interface of organic solvents and graphite. The dimension of the nanoporous space or nanowell formed by the self-assembly of DBAs can be controlled from 1. 6 to 4. 7 nm by simply changing the alkyl chain length from C 6 to C 20. Single molecules as well as homoclusters and heteroclusters are capable of coadsorbing within the host matrix using shape- and size-complementarity principles. Moreover, on the basis of the versatility of the DBA molecules that allows chemical modification of the alkyl chain terminals, we were able to decorate the interior space of the nanoporous networks with functional groups such as azobenzenedicarboxylic acid for photoresponsive guest adsorption/ desorption or <b>fluoroalkanes</b> and tetraethylene glycol groups for selective guest binding by electrostatic interactions and zincporphyrin units for complexation with a guest by charge-transfer interactions.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis is directed toward the efficient, enantioselective synthesis of chiral products that have useful functionality. This goal was pursued through catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation, a reaction class that selectively introduces one or two stereocenters into a molecule in an atom-efficient step. This reaction uses a small amount (often < 1 mol%) of a chiral catalyst to impart stereoselectivity to the product formed. Though catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation {{is not a new}} reaction type, there remain many substrate classes for which it is ineffective. The present thesis describes efforts to extend the reaction to some of these substrates classes. Some of the products synthesized in these studies may eventually find use as building blocks for the production of chiral pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or flavouring or colouring agents. However, the primary and immediate aim of this thesis was to develop and demonstrate new catalysts that are rapid and effective in the asymmetric hydrogenation of a broad range of compounds. Paper I describes the design and construction of two new, related chiral iridium compounds that are catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation. They each contain an N,P-donating phosphinooxazoline ligand that is held together by a rigid bicyclic unit. One of these iridium compounds catalyzed the asymmetric hydrogenation of acyclic aryl imines, often with very good enantioselectivities. This is particularly notable because acyclic imines are difficult to reduce with useful enantioselectivity. The second catalyst was useful for the asymmetric hydrogenation of two aryl olefins. In Paper II, the class of catalysts introduced into Paper I is expanded to include many more related compounds, and these are also applied to the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral imines and olefins. By studying a range of related catalysts that differ in a single attribute, we were able to probe how different parts of the catalyst affect the yield and selectivity of the hydrogenation reactions. Whereas iridium catalysts had been applied to the asymmetric hydrogenation of imines and largely unfunctionalized olefins prior to this work (with varied degrees of success), they had not been used to reduce fluoroolefins. Their hydrogenation, which is discussed in Paper III, was complicated by concomitant defluorination to yield non-halogenated alkanes. To combat this problem, several iridium-based hydrogenation catalysts were applied to the reaction. Two catalysts stood out for their ability to produce chiral <b>fluoroalkanes</b> in good enantioselectivity while minimizing the defluorination reaction, and one of these bore a phosphinooxazoline ligand of the type described in Papers I and II. Enol phosphinates are another class of olefins that had not previously been subjected to iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. They do, however, constitute an attractive substrate class, because the product chiral alkyl phosphinates can be transformed into chiral alcohols or chiral phosphines with no erosion of enantiopurity. Iridium complexes of the phosphinooxazoline ligands described in Papers I and II were extremely effective catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of enol phosphinates. They produced alkyl phosphinates from di- and trisubstituted enol phosphinate, β-ketoester-derived enol phosphinates, and even purely alkyl-substituted enol phopshinates, in very high yields and enantioselectivities...|$|R

Bei En-Molekülen mit asymmetrischer sterischer Hinderung, wie den Carenen, verläuft die kinetisch kontrollierte CF 2 -Addition stereospezifisch. Durch Addition an, von chiralen Tartraten abgeleiteten, chiralen α,β-ungesättigten Acetalen werden hohe Diastereoselektivitäten erreicht. Für diese Reaktion konnte eine {{alternative}} Methode entwickelt werden, welche das (CF 3) 2 Cd durch Diethylcadmium und CF 3 I ersetzt. Tieftemperatur-NMR-Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass hierbei CF 3 CdEt die aktive Difluorcarbenquelle darstellt. Oxirane werden durch (CF 3) 2 Cd in hohen Ausbeuten in Difluorcyclopropane überführt. Die kontrollierte thermische Zersetzung von (CF 3) 2 Cd in Gegenwart von Alkoholen und Carbonsäuren führt zu Difluormethylethern und –estern. Die Ausbeuten hängen hierbei von der Acidität der OH-Funktion ab. Während aromatische Aldehyde durch (CF 3) 2 Cd in Difluormethylbenzol-Derivate überführt werden, stellen gem -(Difluormethoxy) fluoralkane die Hauptprodukte von aliphatischen Aldehyden dar. Analoge Reaktionen werden im Falle von Ketonen beobachtet. Der Mechanismus dieser Umsetzungen wird diskutiert. Die Reaktion mit sterisch beladenen cycloaliphatischen Thioketonen führt zur Bildung von Difluorthiiranen und 2, 2 -Difluor- 1, 3 -dithiacyclopentanen. Aromatische Thioketone werden in 1, 1, 2, 2 -Tetrafluorcyclopropane überführt. Die stereospezifische Öffnung des Dreirings in 2 -Alkoxymethyl- 1, 1 -difluor- 3 -phenylcyclopropanen ist durch starke Säuren, wie Bromwasserstoff- oder Perchlorsäure, möglich. In ähnlicher Weise können 4 -Chlor- 3, 3 -difluor- 4 -phenyl- 1 -butene durch Reaktion dieser Cyclopropane mit SOCl 2, SnCl 4 oder SbCl 5 erhalten werden. Die entsprechenden Iod-Derivate sind mit Me 3 SiI zugänglich. The aim of {{this thesis}} was (a) to explore the synthetic potential of the recently available, donor-free bis(trifluoromethyl) cadmium, (CF 3) 2 Cd, as a low-temperature source for the generation of difluorocarbene, CF 2, (b) to synthesize a variety of difluorocyclopropanes, (c) to examine possibilities for the controlled stereospecific addition of CF 2 to multiple bond systems or its insertion into acidic X-H bonds, and (d) to investigate the reactivity of selected difluorocyclopropanes. While the reactivity is reduced by donor molecules, (CF 3) 2 Cd is extremely reactive in non-coordinating solvents and evolves CF 2 well below 0  °C. In the presence of electron-rich alkenes or alkynes, cyclopropanes or cyclopropenes, respectively, are formed in high yields, while dimerization of CF 2 is preferred with electron–poor systems such as allyl bromide. The kinetically controlled addition of CF 2 to sterically hindered double bonds such as carenes proceeds stereospecifically. High diastereospecificity is achieved upon addition of CF 2 to chiral α,β-unsaturated acetals which are derived from aldehydes and chiral tartrates. For this reaction, an alternative "one-pot" synthesis was developed replacing the dangerous (CF 3) 2 Cd by diethylcadmium and CF 3 I. Low-temperature NMR investigations indicated that CF 3 CdEt is the active CF 2 source in this case. Oxiranes are converted by (CF 3) 2 Cd to the corresponding difluorocyclopropanes by desoxygenation followed by re-addition of CF 2. The controlled thermal decomposition of (CF 3) 2 Cd {{in the presence of}} alcohols or carboxylic acids allows the preparation of difluoromethyl ethers or esters, respectively - the yields depending on the acidity of the respective OH function. While 1, 1 -difluoromethylbenzene derivatives are obtained from (CF 3) 2 Cd with aromatic aldehydes, gem -(difluoromethyl) <b>fluoroalkanes</b> are the major products of the reaction with aliphatic aldehydes. Corresponding conversions are found with ketones. The mechanism of the reactions is discussed. In case of aliphatic ketones, elimination of HF followed by addition of CF 2 also provides 1, 1, 2 -trifluoro- and 1, 1 -difluoro- 2 -(difluoromethoxy) cyclopropanes in moderate amounts. With sterically crowded cycloaliphatic thioketones, both formation of difluorothiiranes and of 2, 2 -difluoro- 1, 3 -dithiacyclopentanes are observed, the latter being formed by addition of CF 2 to the CS double bond followed by addition of a second thioketone molecule and cyclization. Aromatic thioketones are converted to 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrafluorocyclopropanes by desulfurization and addition of a second CF 2 moiety. The stereospecific opening of the three membered ring of 2 -alkoxymethyl- 1, 1 -difluoro- 3 -phenylcyclopropanes is possible with strong acids such as hydrobromic or perchloric acid. Similarly, 4 -chloro- 3, 3 -difluoro- 4 -phenyl- 1 -butenes are obtained by reaction of these cyclopropanes with SOCl 2, SnCl 4, or SbCl 5 while the corresponding iodo derivatives are accessible by reaction with Me 3 SiI. </P...|$|R
