5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lower the current {{consumer}} tariff for electricity, the government {{has decided not to}} renew the power purchase agreements of privately owned thermal power stations when their licences expire, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> with the six now-decommissioned private power producers listed below. The government will utilize the new Sampur plant combined with new renewable sources to accommodate the lost private-sector capacity, with plans to introduce nuclear power after 2030.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done.</b> It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

60|$|When he {{had stood}} on the hearth-rug, {{counting}} the pattern and counting also the future chances of his own life, the remembrances of Mrs. Bold's comfortable income had certainly not damped his first assured feeling of love for her. And why should <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so? Need <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so with the purest of men? Be that as it may, Mr. Arabin decided against himself; he decided that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> so in his case, {{and that he was}} not the purest of men.|$|R

25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting <b>has</b> to <b>do</b> {{with a lot of}} things. Color is among the things <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to <b>do</b> with. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> to <b>do</b> with surface. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> to <b>do</b> with shape, <b>It</b> <b>has</b> to <b>do</b> with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|R

25|$|It {{was named}} after George Howells Broadhurst, an Anglo-American dramatist who came to America in 1886. In {{addition}} to writing plays, he managed theaters in Milwaukee, Baltimore, and San Francisco before he decided to open his own {{in association with the}} Shubert brothers. The theatre was constructed to house both musicals and plays, which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> successfully for more than a century. It has been designated a New York City landmark.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{distinguished}} Coughlan's {{situation from}} one where an authority {{had not given}} an express promise but had only made a representation that an individual was entitled to be treated {{in a manner consistent}} with a policy in force at the time. In this situation, the authority is only compelled to take into account its previous position or the representation made to the individual before deciding how it should proceed, and if <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> so the court may only determine if the authority acted in a Wednesbury-unreasonable manner.|$|E
25|$|The first question, then, {{was whether}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> had an {{adequate}} {{opportunity to do}} so, regardless of whether <b>it</b> actually <b>had.</b> Soler claimed that <b>it</b> could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so at the Supreme Court since the record was already fixed.

25|$|Most of {{the territories}} are {{directly}} {{administered by the}} Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although {{less than that of}} the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.|$|E
25|$|Consider a Stackelberg game (i.e. {{one which}} {{fulfills}} the requirements described above for sustaining a Stackelberg equilibrium) in which, for some reason, the leader believes that whatever action it takes, the follower will choose a Cournot quantity (perhaps the leader {{believes that the}} follower is irrational). If the leader played a Stackelberg action, (it believes) that the follower will play Cournot. Hence it is non-optimal for the leader to play Stackelberg. In fact, its best response (by the definition of Cournot equilibrium) is to play Cournot quantity. Once <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> this, the best response of the follower is to play Cournot.|$|E
25|$|The first {{seeks to}} resolve a longstanding debate in {{historical}} linguistics by making a case for the Kurgan hypothesis {{on the origins of}} the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, {{were it not for the}} ability to digest milk.|$|E

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
