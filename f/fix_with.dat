Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to hear or understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a [...] "total breakdown in communications by the flightcrew."

40|$|Background: Unstable pelvic {{fractures}} {{are complex}} and serious injuries. Selection of a fixation method for these fractures remains a challenging problem for orthopedic surgeons. This study aimed to compare the stability of Tile C pelvic fractures <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> two iliosacral (IS) screws and minimally invasive adjustable plate (MIAP) combined with one IS screw. Methods: This study was a biomechanical experiment. Six embalmed specimens of the adult pelvis were used. The soft tissue {{was removed from the}} specimens, and the spines from the fourth lumbar vertebra to the proximal one-third of both femurs were retained. The pubic symphysis, bilateral sacroiliac joints and ligaments, bilateral hip joints, bilateral sacrotuberous ligaments, and bilateral sacrospinous ligaments were intact. Tile C pelvic fractures were made on the specimens. The symphysis pubis was <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> a plate, and the fracture on the posterior pelvic ring was <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> two kinds of internal fixation in turn. The specimens were placed in a biomechanical machine at a standing neutral posture. A cyclic vertical load of up to 500 N was applied, and displacement was recorded. Shifts in the fracture gap were measured by a grating displacement sensor. Statistical analysis used: Paired-samples t-test. Results: Under the vertical load of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 N, the average displacement of the specimens <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> MIAP combined with one IS screw was 0. 46, 0. 735, 1. 377, 1. 823, and 2. 215 mm, respectively, which was significantly lower than that of specimens <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> two IS screws under corresponding load (P < 0. 05). Under the vertical load of 500 N, the shift in the fracture gap of specimens <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> MIAP combined with one IS screw was 0. 261 ± 0. 095 mm, and that of specimens <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> two IS screws was 0. 809 ± 0. 170 mm. The difference was significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The stability of Tile C pelvic fractures <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> MIAP combined with one IS screw was better than that <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> two IS screws...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of fixative on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and anisotropy within spinal cord white matter. As glutaraldehyde (GL) better preserves axonal ultrastructure as compared with paraformaldehyde (PF), we hypothesize that spinal cord white matter <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> GL will have increased anisotropic water diffusion as compared <b>with</b> specimens <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> PF. METHODS: Eleven rats were perfusion-fixed with either 4 % PF {{or a combination of}} 2. 5 % GL and 4 % PF. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the ex vivo spinal cord was performed using a 9. 4 T magnet with b values up to 3100 s/mm 2. In-plane resolution was 39 �m � 39 �m, and section thickness was 500 �m. RESULTS: Overall, animals <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> a combination of GL and PF (GL-PF) showed a greater increase in longitudinal ADC (lADC) as compared to those <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> PF only, without differences in transverse ADC (tADC). As a consequence of the increased lADC, overall anisotropic diffusion increased in those animals <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> GL-PF, as measured with an anisotropy index (AI � tADC/lADC). Evaluation of specific tracts demonstrated that lADC for animals <b>fixed</b> <b>with</b> GL-PF were significantly elevated in the rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, an...|$|R

6000|$|... § 2. Every general name, then, {{must have}} a certain and knowable meaning. Now the meaning (as has so often been explained) of a general connotative name, resides in the connotation; in the {{attribute}} on account of which, and to express which, the name is given. Thus, the name animal being given to all things which possess the attributes of sensation and voluntary motion, the word connotes those attributes exclusively, and they constitute the whole of its meaning. If the name be abstract, its denotation is {{the same with the}} connotation of the corresponding concrete; it designates directly the attribute, which the concrete term implies. To give a precise meaning to general names is, then, to <b>fix</b> <b>with</b> steadiness the attribute or attributes connoted by each concrete general name, and denoted by the corresponding abstract. Since abstract names, in the order of their creation, do not precede but follow concrete ones, as is proved by the etymological fact that they are almost always derived from them; we may consider their meaning as determined by, and dependent on, the meaning of their concrete; and thus the problem of giving a distinct meaning to general language, is all included in that of giving a precise connotation to all concrete general names.|$|E

With that solitary exception, however, the entire group remains essentially volcanic in its composition, exactly as it was when I first saw its youthful craters and its red-hot ash-cones pushed gradually up, century after century, from the deep blue waters of the Mid-Miocene ocean.|$|E

60|$|Nor need it {{be thought}} that, because the {{ultimate}} methods of work employed by painters {{vary according to}} the particular effects produced by each, there would be any difficulty in obtaining their collective assent to a system of elementary precept. The facts of which it is necessary that the student should be assured in his early efforts, are so simple, so few, and so well known to all able draughtsmen that, as I have just said, it would be rather doubt of the need of stating what seemed to them self-evident, than reluctance to speak authoritatively on points capable of dispute, that would {{stand in the way of}} their giving form to a code of general instruction. To take merely two instances: It will perhaps appear hardly credible that among amateur students, however far advanced in more showy accomplishments, there will not be found one in a hundred who can make an accurate drawing to scale. It is much if they can copy anything with approximate fidelity of its real size. Now, the inaccuracy of eye which prevents a student from drawing to scale is in fact nothing else than an entire want of appreciation of proportion, and therefore of composition. He who alters the relations of dimensions to each other in his copy, shows that he does not enjoy those relations in the original--that is to say, that all appreciation of noble design (which is based on the most exquisite relations of magnitude) is impossible to him. To give him habits of mathematical accuracy in transference of the outline of complex form, is therefore among the first, and even among the most important, means of educating his taste. A student who can <b>fix</b> <b>with</b> precision the cardinal points of a bird's wing, extended in any fixed position, and can then draw the curves of its individual plumes without measurable error, has advanced further towards a power of understanding the design of the great masters than he could by reading many volumes of criticism, or passing many months in undisciplined examination of works of art.|$|E
60|$|If {{we wish to}} make an {{impression}} {{on the minds of}} any persons in France, or to persuade them to join our standard, it is impossible that they should not be more easily led, and more readily formed and disciplined, (civilly and martially disciplined,) by those who speak their language, who are acquainted with their manners, who are conversant with their usages and habits of thinking, and who have a local knowledge of their country, and some remains of ancient credit and consideration, than with a body congregated from all tongues and tribes. Where none of the respectable native interests are seen in the transaction, it is impossible that any declarations can convince those that are within, or those that are without, that anything else than some sort of hostility in the style of a conqueror is meant. At best, it will appear to such wavering persons, (if such there are,) whom we mean to <b>fix</b> <b>with</b> us, a choice whether they are to continue a prey to domestic banditti, or to be fought for as a carrion carcass and picked to the bone by all the crows and vultures of the sky. They may take protection, (and they would, I doubt not,) but they can have neither alacrity nor zeal in such a cause. When they see nothing but bands of English, Spaniards, Neapolitans, Sardinians, Prussians, Austrians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Slavonians, Croatians, acting as principals, it is impossible they should think we come with a beneficent design. Many of those fierce and barbarous people have already given proofs how little they regard any French party whatsoever. Some of these nations the people of France are jealous of: such are the English and the Spaniards;--others they despise: such are the Italians;--others they hate and dread: such are the German and Danubian powers. At best, such interposition of ancient enemies excites apprehension; but in this case, how can they suppose that we come to maintain their legitimate monarchy in a truly paternal French government, to protect their privileges, their laws, their religion, and their property, when they see us make use of no one person who has any interest in them, any knowledge of them, or any the least zeal for them? On the contrary, they see that we do not suffer any of those who have shown a zeal in that cause which we seem to make our own to come freely into any place in which the allies obtain any footing.|$|E

'It's {{an awkward}} sort of muddle to have got oneself into.' {{he thought to}} himself as he walked along the asphalte {{pavement}} in front of the sea-wall: 'a most confoundedly awkward fix to have got oneself into with a pretty girl of the lower classes. She's beautiful certainly; that there's no denying; the handsomest woman on the whole I ever remember to have seen at any time anywhere; and when I'm actually by her side--though it's a weakness to confess it--I'm really not quite sure that I'm not positively quite in love with her! She'd make a grand sort of Messalina, without a doubt, a model for a painter, with her frank imperious face, and her splendid voluptuous figure; a Faustina, a Catherine of Russia, an Ann Boleyn--to be fitly painted only by a Rubens or a Gustave Courbet. Yet how I can ever have been such a particular fool as to go and get myself entangled with her I can't imagine. Heredity, heredity; it must run in the family, for certain. There's Ernest has gone and handed himself over bodily to this grocer person somewhere down in Devonshire; and I myself, who perfectly see the folly of his absurd proceeding, have independently put myself into this very similar awkward <b>fix</b> <b>with</b> Selah Briggs here. Selah Briggs, indeed! The very name reeks with commingled dissent, vulgarity, and greengrocery. Her father's deacon of his chapel, and goes out at night when there's no missionary meeting on, to wait at serious dinner parties! Or rather, I suppose he'd desert the most enticing missionary to earn a casual half-crown at even an ungodly champagne-drinking dinner! Then that's the difference between me and Ernest. Ernest's selfish, incurably and radically selfish. Because this Oswald girl happens to take his passing fancy, and to fit in with his impossible Schurzian notions, he'll actually go and marry her. Not only will he have no consideration for mother--who really is a very decent sort of body in her own fashion, if you don't rub her up the wrong way or expect too much from her--but he'll also interfere, without a thought, with MY prospects and my advancement. Now, THAT I call really selfish; and selfishness is a vulgar piggish vice that I thoroughly abominate. I don't deny that I'm a trifle selfish myself, of course, in a refined and cultivated manner--I flatter myself, in fact, that introspective analysis is one of my strong points; and I don't conceal my own failings from my own consciousness with any weak girlish prevarications. But after all, as Hobbes very well showed (though our shallow modern philosophers pretend to laugh at him), selfishness {{in one form or another}} is at the very base of all human motives; the difference really is between sympathetic and unsympathetic selfishness--between piggishness and cultivated feelings. Now I will NOT give way to the foolish and selfish impulses which would lead me to marry Selah Briggs. I will put a curb upon my inclinations, and do what is really best in the end for all the persons concerned--and for myself especially.' ...|$|E
