Widespread influenza activity is being reported in most U. S. states, with influenza A (H 3 N 2) viruses most common. H 3 N 2 -predominant flu seasons {{have been associated with}} more hospitalizations and deaths in older people and young children in the past. In addition, approximately two-thirds of H 3 N 2 viruses that have been tested at CDC are antigenically or genetically different from the H 3 N 2 vaccine virus. This difference suggests that vaccine effectiveness may be reduced this season. High <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> being observed, similar to what was seen during the 2012 - 2013 influenza season. <b>Hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> especially high among people 65 years and older. In this context, the use of influenza antiviral drugs as an adjunct to vaccination becomes even more important than usual in protecting people from influenza. Antiviral medications are effective in treating influenza and reducing complications. Antivirals are available and recommended, but evidence from the current and previous influenza seasons suggests that they are severely underutilized. This CDC Health Update is being issued 1) to remind clinicians that influenza should be high on their list of possible diagnoses for ill patients, because influenza activity is elevated nationwide, and 2) to advise clinicians that all hospitalized patients and all high-risk patients (either hospitalized or outpatient) with suspected influenza should be treated as soon as possible with one of three available influenza antiviral medications. This should be done without waiting for confirmatory influenza testing. While antiviral drugs work best when given early, therapeutic benefit has been observed even when treatment is initiated later.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine overall and cause‐specific <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> among survivors of childhood cancer and compare rates to the U. S. population. Procedure The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospective cohort of 5 + year survivors of childhood malignancies treated at 26 participating centers. Self‐reported hospitalizations from 10, 366 survivors (diagnosed 1970 – 1986) were compared to U. S. population rates using age‐ and sex‐stratified standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Reasons for hospitalization were evaluated and associations between demographic, cancer and treatment‐related risk factors with hospitalization were investigated. Results Survivors were, on average, 20. 9 years from cancer diagnosis (SD: 4. 6, range: 13 – 32) and 28. 6 years of age (SD: 7. 7, range: 13 – 51). Survivor <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> 1. 6 times the U. S. population (95 % CI: 1. 6; 1. 7). Increased <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> noted irrespective of gender, age at follow‐up and cancer diagnosis, with highest SIRs noted among male (SIR[*]=[*] 2. 6, 95 % CI: 2. 2; 3. 0) and female (SIR[*]=[*] 2. 7, 95 % CI: 2. 4; 3. 1) survivors aged 45 – 54. Female gender, an existing chronic health condition and/or a second neoplasm, and prior treatment with radiation were associated with an increased risk of non‐obstetrical hospitalization.

Thirty-seven hospital service areas for children [HSAP] were created with the method of "small area analysis", reflecting user-based health markets. Descriptive statistics and general linear models were applied to analyze the data. Results The mean stationary hospitalization rate over four years was 66. 1 discharges per 1000 children. Hospitalizations for respiratory problem are most dominant in young children (25. 9 %) and highest <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> associated with geographical factors of urban areas and specific language regions.

40|$|Patient {{outcomes}} are better for those patients hospitalized in institutions with higher case volumes, 1 – 5 especially for surgical conditions. 6, 7 Heart failure (HF), {{one of the}} most common reasons for hospitalization in North America, 8, 9 is one of the few cardiovascular conditions with an increas-ing prevalence, 10 and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> continuing to increase. 11 Recently, Joynt and colleagues 12 reported that patients admitted to hospitals with medium (200 – 400 HF cases per 23 months) or high HF volume (> 400 HF cases per 23 months) exhibited lower rates of mortality or readmission within 30 days than those patients admitted to low-volume hospitals. Process measures (such as percentage of patients with HF who received discharge instructions) were also more often completed in the medium- or high-volume hospitals. Ross and colleagues also showed that admission to a hospital with higher HF case volume was associated with a reduction in 30 -day mortality. 5 Clinical Perspective on p 1154 Although most patients with HF admitted to hospital first present to an emergency department (ED), 10, 13 we are not aware of any studies till date that have examined whether ED experience with managing HF influences outcomes. Specifically, we asked the question “do EDs that see higher volumes of HF cases discharge a higher proportion home, admit a sicker spectrum of patients, and have better outcomes than lower volume EDs?...|$|E
40|$|At present time, {{there is}} {{uncertainty}} regarding whether influenza-like illness in healthy adults is best managed by preventive efforts {{that use the}} trivalent influenza vaccine, administration of neuraminidase inhibitors {{at the onset of}} illness, or recommendation of supportive care alone at the onset of illness. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis that examined these 3 strategies for managing influenza-like illness. Vaccination with inactivated trivalent vaccine would save approximately $ 25 per person while resulting in a net gain of ∼ 3. 2 quality-adjusted hours relative to providing treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. A quality-adjusted hour is a fraction of a quality-adjusted life-year, which is the equivalent of 1 year lived in perfect health. Treatment with oseltamivir was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness of approximately $ 27, 619 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to providing supportive care. Vaccination is cost-saving relative to providing either treatment with oseltamivir or providing supportive care alone. Influenza virus infections account for ∼ 30, 000 deaths, upward of 200, 000 hospitalizations, and more than a million ambulatory care visits and days of lost work in the United States each year [1 – 4]. However, mortality for adults who do not have diabetes, chronic lung dis-ease, or heart disease is rare, and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> much lower than they are among elderly individuals or persons with chronic disease [4]. Nonetheless, un-dervaccination of healthy adults almost certainly results in morbidity and mortality when the virus is trans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock {{syndrome}} (DHF/DSS) {{is a growing}} global health problem. It is not known how age affects the outcome of secondary dengue infections. In an island setting, a large DHF/DSS outbreak in Cuba occurred in 1981. Involved were individuals, 3 – 40 year old, whose only lifetime dengue exposure was to DEN- 1 in 1977 and DEN- 2 in 1981. In this report we calculate age-specific DHF/DSS hospitalization and death rates based on secondary DEN 2 infections. Methods: Published and unpublished hospital and seroepidemiologic data from the 1981 DHF/DSS outbreak {{were used for the}} analysis. Results: Children, aged 3 and 4 years, with secondary DEN- 2 infections were found to have a high death rate (25. 4 / 10 000 secondary DEN- 2 infections). The death rate fell with increasing age, being 15. 9 -fold lower in the 10 – 14 -year age group. The death rate for children aged 3 – 14 years was 14. 5 -fold higher than in young adults aged 15 – 39 years. The death rate rose somewhat in adults aged 50 years and older. DHF/DSS hospitalization rates showed the same trend as death rates. Conclusions: Age is an important variable in the outcome of secondary DEN- 2 infections. DHF/DSS case fatality and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> highest in young infants and the elderly. The risk that a child will die during a secondary DEN- 2 infection is nearly 15 -fold higher than the risk in adults...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{infection}} occurs commonly {{in infants}} aged ≤ 2 years, and severe infection results in hospitalization with accompanying morbidity and mortality. Palivizumab {{has been available}} for prophylaxis for the past 15 years. Prospective data on patients who received palivizumab from 2005 to 2012 has been assembled in the Canadian registry (CARESS) to document utilization, compliance, and health outcomes in both hospital and community settings. Long-term data is necessary to evaluate the impact of palivizumab on the incidence of RSV infections, minimize healthcare resources, and identify which infant subpopulations are receiving prophylaxis. A database search was also conducted for similar information from published registries, and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> compared to results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Overall <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> (percent; range) for respiratory-related illnesses and RSV-specific infection in infants who meet standard indications for prophylaxis were 6. 6 (3. 3 – 7. 7) and 1. 55 (0. 3 – 2. 06), respectively, in CARESS, which closely aligns with registry data from 4 other countries, despite the former comprising the largest cohort of complex patients internationally. Overall RSV-related <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> lower across registries compared to equivalent patients in RCTs. Registry data provides valuable information regarding real-world experience with palivizumab, while facilitating the genesis of new research themes...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundChronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality caused by cigarette smoking and other environmental exposures. While variation in exposures may affect COPD morbidity and mortality, little is known about geographic variation, a surrogate of exposures. The objective of this manuscript is to explore the geographic variation in COPD <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> among the Texas population in 2006. MethodsThe study population consisted of all Texas residents with COPD hospitalizations in the 2006 Texas Health Care Information Council (THCIC) data. County population estimates stratified by race, age, and gender were linked to THCIC data to calculate county level COPD <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> per 100, 000 admissions. The data were merged with Urban Influence Codes by county, and metropolitan status was determined by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) criteria. Variation in COPD <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> analyzed using Poisson Regression. ResultsOverall, non Hispanic (NH) Whites had the highest <b>rate</b> of <b>hospitalization,</b> followed by NH Blacks (rate ratio =  0. 42) and Hispanics (RR =  0. 17), the 65 + age category had the highest <b>rates</b> of <b>hospitalization.</b> In the metropolitan counties COPD <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> lower than non-metropolitan counties, however in metropolitan counties the <b>rates</b> of <b>hospitalization</b> were significantly higher (p <  0. 0001) in females compared to males. The <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> significantly higher in males in public health regions 10 and 11, which are predominantly non-metropolitan counties. ConclusionsIn Texas there is substantial geographic variation in <b>hospitalization</b> <b>rates</b> associated with gender and race/ethnicity. Other factors that may contribute to the variation and require further investigation include differences in smoking and exposure to other environmental risk factors, access to primary care, medical practice patterns, and coding practices...|$|R
