In Seven Network these involved questions relating to whether certain documents should be subject to privilege, or whether the reports of various experts should be admitted, while the <b>interlocutory</b> <b>judgments</b> in Cha involved procedural questions. Some of the legal problems in Cha were created by the plaintiff running out of money due to the length of the case which, in part, was caused by the fact that it involved 14 respondents. The case therefore raises issues as to whether the final award of a relatively modest $ 240, 000 warranted the long defamation trial. Seven Network meanwhile raises issues as to whether the estimated cost of $ 200 m was justified, particularly as it is. tax deductable for the companies, and whether companies should be allowed to use the court system for such litigation...|$|R

5000|$|In many cases, a {{two-step process}} may be required: 1) a trial, during which oral and {{documentary}} evidence is heard, and either affirms or denies {{the right of}} the moving party to effect a partition of the subject property(s), and, if affirmed, results in an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>judgment</b> (sometimes called a [...] "first interlocutory judgment"), and 2) particularly in a contested partition, an evidentiary hearing (also a trial), usually after the property(s) have been appraised by experts, and during which trial additional oral and documentary evidence is heard, the property(s) are ordered divided and awarded proportionally where possible, including cash compensation where proportional division is impractical or impossible (sometimes called a [...] "second interlocutory judgment"). The division usually requires the employment of experts such as engineers and surveyors, and the preparation of special reports (which include conveyance deeds and easement deeds). As a final act, the court, in a hearing (not a trial), will accept the special reports and order that these be executed by a title company, which will also effectuate [...] "recordation" [...] of the conveyance and easement deeds (any cash compensation due any of the parties will also be effectuated within the escrow).|$|E
