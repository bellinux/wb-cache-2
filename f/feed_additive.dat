25|$|Arsenic {{is used as}} a <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> in {{poultry and}} swine production, in {{particular}} in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve feed efficiency, and to prevent disease. An example is roxarsone, which had been used as a broiler starter by about 70% of U.S. broiler growers. The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens. A successor to Alpharma, Zoetis, continues to sell nitarsone, primarily for use in turkeys.|$|E

Cottonseed meal, 1.5 {{million tons of}} which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is [...] suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals, is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, {{as it was in}} Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and poultry. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals. Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle. A proposal to end the use of cattle blood, restaurant scraps, and poultry litter (fecal matter, feathers, bedding material) in January 2004 has yet to be implemented.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{summarizes}} the experimental knowledge on efficacy, possible modes of activity and aspects of application of phytogenic products as <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> for poultry. <b>Feed</b> <b>additives</b> are a group of feed ingredients that can cause a desired animal response in a non-nutrient role such as pH shift, growth or metabolic modifier. Many substances found in nature have a wide range of growth promoting, immunostimulatory or antimicrobial activity. Common <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> used in poultry diets include antimicrobials, antioxidants, pH control agents and exzymes. Phytogenic are a relatively young class of <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> and in recent years this <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> have gained considerable attention in the feed industry. They are a wide variety of herbs, spices and products derived thereof and are mainly essential oils. Although, numerous reports have demonstrated antioxidative and antimicrobial and immune stimulation efficacy in vitro, respective experimental in vivo evidences is still quite limited. A limited number of experimental comparisons of phytogenic <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> with antibiotics and acidifiers have suggested similar effects on the gut. Gut microflora has significant effects on host nutrition, health and growth performance by interacting with nutrient utilization and the development of gut system of the host. In addition, some phytogenic compounds seem to promote intestinal mucus production.

This series of fact sheets includes some of the major classifications of products used as <b>feed</b> <b>additives.</b> Every effort has been made to ensure that all the information in every fact sheet is current and based on the latest scientific publications available at the time of writing. The objective of these fact sheets is to discuss some of the basic concepts to help producers improve their understanding of these products. They also aim to promote more responsible and judicious use of <b>feed</b> <b>additives.</b> Beneficial claims from dietary inclusions of acidifiers include control of bacterial growth in feed, increased growth performance, improvement in nutrient digestibility, and control of harmful bacteria in the gut. Antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, have been used in pig production for over 50 years. Early studies indicated significant improvements in pig growth performance when antibiotics were fed. With the improvements in production practices and health status of pig herds, positive responses to in-feed antibiotics may not be as large in today’s modern facilities. Additionally, the magnitude of response differs with the stage of pig growth. Use of antibiotics as <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> is subject to regulatory policies to prevent residues and enhance public health. It is therefore important {{to be aware of the}} current information available concerning the effects of commonly used in-feed antibiotics in pig production...|$|R

The objective of these fact sheets is to discuss some of the basic concepts to help producers improve their understanding of these products. They also aim to promote more responsible and judicious use of <b>feed</b> <b>additives.</b> Feed-additive products used in swine diets include natural and synthetic substances and have been grouped in this series of fact sheets according to the classifications shown in the text box. Each group of <b>feed</b> <b>additives</b> is discussed in a separate fact sheet, with special emphasis on some of the common questions that producers might have for each product. <b>Feed</b> <b>additives</b> offer a variety of potential benefits. However, they add to total production cost and should be evaluated carefully. Because their use in pig diets is to improve performance and profitability, an effective feed-additive product must be able to pay for itself. It must be able to provide an improvement in productivity that is, at minimum, equivalent to the added cost of the feed-additive product. This highlights the value of scientifi c data from well-designed experiments as the basis for evaluating such products. Having access to such information is critical in determining if one product’s claims are actually possible and repeatable in commercial settings. Producers must always try to verify that the data for a particular product came from controlled, unbiased experiments with supporting statistical data. When choosing between feed-additive products, priority for using a specific product should be given to those that have been shown to provide consistent results in research trials...|$|R
