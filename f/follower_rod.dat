40|$|Equivalent single- and multi-degree-of-freedom {{models have}} been {{developed}} for a flexible cam-follower mechanism. Both transverse and axial flexibility of the follower and return spring, as well as transverse and torsional flexibility of the camshaft have been included. In the multi-degree-of-freedom model, the camshaft is assigned two rotational degrees of freedom, one at the cam and the other at the flywheel. The follower mass has a degree of freedom in the axial as well as the transverse direction of the <b>follower</b> <b>rod.</b> The analytical models take into account the fluctuating camshaft angular speed as the input excitation. The governing equations of motion, with time-periodic coefficients, have been systematically developed. The return spring was believed to influence the follower response in ways previously not understood, necessitating a closer examination of its kinematics of deformation. An analytic expression for the transverse stiffness of a closed-coiled helical spring with an axial, transverse and end moment, has been derived. A closed-form expression is obtained when the ends are constrained to remain parallel. Such constraints, and the varying transverse flexibility of the return spring with axial deflection led to a newly described phenomenon of moment stiffening. A sideways tracking of the follower roller on the cam surface is observed, in an experimental cam-follower mechanism, for both the rise and return motions of the follower. It results from the camshaft deflection, causing the cam to exert a thrust load on the follower roller. The tracking gives rise to erroneous experimental cam rise and return profiles. Follower mass responses for Rise-Return-Rise and Rise-Dwell-Return-Dwell follower motion event types, and simple harmonic and polynomial cam rise and return profiles, have been investigated. The multi-degree-of-freedom model, unlike the single-degree-of-freedom model, uniformly predicts the experimental follower mass response accurately for both follower motion events. The overall frequency and amplitude contents of the analytical and experimental responses, noticeably during the top and bottom dwell periods, compare very favorably. Parametric stability charts are presented for both follower motion event types as well as the two cam rise and return profiles considered. ...|$|E
50|$|Like the {{preceding}} /5 bikes, the /6 models are air-cooled, four-stroke, opposed-twin (boxer) engines with hemispherical combustion chambers. The engine {{is built around}} a one-piece tunnel crank-case. The camshaft is driven by a duplex chain and is located below the crankshaft. Valves are actuated by the camshaft through hardened <b>followers,</b> push <b>rods,</b> and rocker arms. The same base 247 engine was used for these motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of the {{production}} form of Fokker's [...] "Stangensteuerung" [...] synchronization mechanism. The green handle is used to lower the red cam follower onto the cam wheel attached to the propeller shaft. When the cam raises the <b>follower,</b> the blue <b>rod</b> is depressed against the spring, enabling the yellow trigger plate to be reached when the purple firing button is pressed.|$|R
50|$|The /5 {{models are}} air-cooled, four-stroke, opposed-twin (boxer) engines with {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers. The engine {{is built around}} a one-piece tunnel crank-case. The camshaft is driven by a duplex chain and is located below the crankshaft (unlike the /2 series which had the gear-driven camshaft above the crank). This reversed arrangement improves ground clearance for the same center of gravity and assists lubrication of the camshaft. Valves are actuated by the camshaft through hardened <b>followers,</b> push <b>rods,</b> and rocker arms. The 500 cc and 600 cc models are equipped with Bing slide-type carburetors with 26 mm throats. The R75/5 comes with 32 mm Bing CV (Constant Vacuum/constant depression) type carburetors. As in all BMW motorcycles at the time, the clutch is a single-disk dry clutch.|$|R
50|$|Bristol {{chose to}} base its first model {{on the best}} {{features}} of two outstanding pre-war BMWs, namely the 328's engine, and the 326's frame. These were covered with a neat mainly steel body but with aluminium bonnet, door and boot skins and inspired by the BMW 327's. The Bristol 400 featured a slightly modified version of BMW's six-cylinder pushrod engine of 1,971 cc (bore 66 mm, stroke 96 mm). This engine, considered advanced for its time due to its hemispherical combustion chambers and very short inlet and exhaust ports, developed 80 horsepower at 4,500 revs per minutes and could carry the 400 to {{a top speed of}} around 148 km/h (92 mph) with acceleration to match. In order to maintain a hemispherical combustion chamber, the valves had to be positioned at an angle to the head. In order to drive both sets of valves from a single camshaft, the Bristol engine used a system of <b>rods,</b> <b>followers</b> and bell-cranks to drive the valves {{on the far side of}} the engine from the camshaft. Owners soon found that setting and maintaining the numerous clearances in the system was difficult but vital to keep the engine in tune. The gearbox was a four-speed manual with synchromesh on the upper three ratios and a freewheel on first.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe local energy photon deposit must be {{accounted}} accurately for Gen-IV fast reactors, advanced light-water nuclear reactors (Gen-III+) {{and the new}} experimental Jules Horowitz Reactor (JHR). The γ energy accounts for about 10 % of the total energy released {{in the core of}} a thermal or fast reactor. The γ-energy release is much greater in the core of the reactor than in its structural sub-assemblies (such as reflector, control <b>rod</b> <b>followers,</b> dummy sub-assemblies). However, because of the propagation of γ from the core regions to the neighboring fuel-free assemblies, the contribution of γ energy to the total heating can be dominant. For reasons related to their performance, power reactors require a 7. 5 % (1 σ) uncertainty for the energy deposition in non-fuelled zones. For the JHR material-testing reactor, a 5 % (1 s) uncertainty is required in experimental positions. In order to verify the adequacy of the calculation of γ-heating, TLD and γ-fission chambers were used to derive the experimental heating values. Experimental programs were and are still conducted in different Cadarache facilities such as MASURCA (for SFR), MINERVE and EOLE (for JHR and Gen-III+ reactors). The comparison of calculated and measured γ-heating values shows an underestimation in all experimental programs indicating that for the most γ-production data from 239 Pu in current nuclear-data libraries is highly suspicious. The first evaluation priority is for prompt γ-multiplicity for U and Pu fission but similar values for otheractinides such as Pu and U are also required. The nuclear data library JEFF 3. 1. 1 contains most of the photon production data. However, there are some nuclei for which there are missing or erroneous data which need to be completed or modified. A review of the data available shows a lack of measurements for conducting serious evaluation efforts. New measurements are needed to guide new evaluation efforts which benefit from consolidated modeling techniques...|$|R
