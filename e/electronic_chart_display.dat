50|$|The last {{decades have}} seen huge {{developments}} in technology within navigation and communication systems. Sophisticated and advanced technology is developing rapidly.

40|$|Approved for Public Release; Distribution is UnlimitedReal-time {{recursive}} {{parameter identification}} {{is applied to}} surface vessel modeling for maneuvering path prediction. An end-to end system is developed to simulate vessel motion, identify vessel parameters and estimate future path. Path prediction improves bridge team situational awareness by providing a real-time depiction of future motion over the ground on an <b>electronic</b> <b>chart</b> and <b>display</b> system (ECDIS). The extended least-squares (ELS) parameter identification approach allows the system to be installed on most platforms without prior knowledge of system dynamics, provided vessel states are available. The system continually tunes to actual environmental conditions, including vessel ballasting, current, wind and sensor biases. In addition to path prediction, the system estimates maximum vessel roll angle during maneuvering. Maximum roll prediction enhances carrier flight deck safety and increases operational effectiveness by reducing sea room requirements. Suitable performance is demonstrated in real-world maneuvering conditions to recommend that maneuvering path prediction {{be incorporated into the}} US Navy's AN/SSN- 6 Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI) <b>electronic</b> <b>charting</b> system.

40|$|Water depth {{is usually}} {{measured}} along a cruise with ship-board echo sounder. For navigational safety, the <b>electronic</b> nautical <b>chart</b> <b>displays</b> the shallower depth from above method, therefore {{it may not}} reflect the true topography of the sea bottom which is required by users like divers, aquaculture, coastal engineering, etc [...] In the remote area or non-accessible regions, depth information is even less than the nautical chart. Formosat- 2 multispectral image was used to derive the detailed bathymetry of Nawan region, without requiring optical data of water. The light is attenuated exponentially in passing through the water, either downward from sea surface, or upward from bottom reflection. The total radiance received by satellites includes scattered light from the atmosphere and water column, and reflected light from the sea surface and the sea bottom. The optical property of Nanwan water is clean and homogeneous. The ratio of reflected blue light to green light depends mostly on the water depth, and is much less by the change in bottom albedo. The surface wave-induced reflectance is a systematic error that may be estimated by near infrared band. The water depth therefore can be calculated from three bands (Blue, Green, and near Infrared) of Formosat- 2 images. The maximal derivable depth from this method is 35 m in Nanwan area, which {{is better than the}} methods of two bands (Blue and Green). Because remote sensing data are average values within a pixel...|$|R
