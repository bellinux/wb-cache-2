Considering this advantage, the separation and detection of nitrostarch was performed as a first application of the MSC- 1. Minimal sample amounts of nitrostarch (1. 7 μg) were detected.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Sulfated {{galactans}} (agarans and carrageenans) are {{accumulated in}} the cell wall of various red algae (Rhodophyta) species. These polysaccharides are of commercial importance in the food, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries due to their unique physicochemical properties. Although having received significant research attention over the last 20 years, events regarding their biosynthesis have not been elucidated. Aiming for the identification of galactosyltransferase (GalT) genes involved in sulfated galactan biosynthesis, cDNA expression libraries were constructed from the prolific agar-producing South African red seaweed Gelidium pristoides (Turner) Kützing and screened by functional complementation of UDP-galactose 4 -epimerase deficient mutants (E. coli and S. cerevisiae). Regretfully, no GalTs were identified. The study however yielded the first UGE enzyme described for a red seaweed. Southern hybridization indicated the presence of two UGE copies and confirmed the gene originated from G. pristoides. Bioinformatic analysis of G. pristoides UGE shows amino acid sequence homology to known UGEs from various organisms. The enzyme was shown to be functional in E. coli crude extracts and showed affinity for UDP-D-galactose, similar to other UDP-galactose 4 -epimerases. Further, the isolated G. pristoides UGE (GpUGE) was biochemically characterized and its kinetic parameters determined. We {{found that there was}} no kinetic difference between this enzyme and previously described UGE enzymes except enhanced activity in the presence of exogenously added NAD+. The UDP-galactose 4 -epimerase (UDP-glucose 4 -epimerase, UGE, EC 5. 1. 3. 2) is an essential Leloir pathway enzyme facilitating the catalytic inter-conversion between UDP-D-glucose and UDP-D-galactose. UDP-D-galactose is the nucleotide sugar required by galactosyltransferases for the production of red algae sulfated galactans. UGE is suspected as being responsible for supplying UDP-D-galactose for the synthesis of sulfated galactans. In planta monitoring of GpUGE transcript levels with respect to dark and light cycling indicated high expression of the enzyme at night, while expression diminished during the day. The occurrence of increased nocturnal UGE expression correlates with floridean starch breakdown at night. Evidence for hydrolysis of floridean starch is also reflected in obtained G. pristoides transcriptome sequence data. In red algae, floridean starch degradation coincides with sulfated galactan production. The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysis enzyme transcripts alongside increased expression of GpUGE suggests the enzyme plays a role in supplying UDP-Dgalactose for sulfated galactan production. As far as we know, this the first report of sequencing and biochemical characterization of a UGE from red seaweed...|$|E

A procedure for the separation <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> into its component populations was developed. Digital image {{analysis showed that}} the resulting preparations contained 1 % or less of the other granule population and were representative <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>starch</b> fraction in flour. The relative surface areas and volumes of these two types <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules were calculated and {{the results indicated that}} for an equal volume <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules, the small granules have 3. 5 [...] 4. 5 times the surface area of the large granules. The protein content of each population was determined from the nitrogen content. The small granules were found to contain 0. 35 % protein as compared to 0. 15 % protein in the large granules. Microspectrofluorometry was used as a means of indirectly measuring protein content and establishing the distribution of protein within the granules, before and after treatments to extract the protein. Extracted proteins from the soft wheat variety Fredrick were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine their distribution between the large and small starch granules. The large starch granules were found to contain one major protein and the small granules eight major proteins. These nine proteins were then isolated by electroelution and a partial characterization was carried out by determining amino acid compositions, N-terminal sequences, protease susceptibilities, peptide maps, and carbohydrate content. The results indicated that the nine proteins have several properties in common and they may be composed of similar structural units. In particular, the amino acid compositions, protease susceptibilities and peptide maps varied only slightly. However, there were a few differences among the proteins. Some of the them tested positive for carbohydrate, while others did not. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that most of the N-termini were blocked, and the two distinct sequences obtained showed no homology to the primary structure of any known protein. One of the major differences between hard and soft wheats {{is the degree to which}} the starch granules are damaged during milling. The extent of damage can be visualized by certain stains, the most common being Congo Red. However, another related dye, Hessian Bordeaux, was found to stain damaged granules much more intensely. The maximum absorbance <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules stained with Hessian Bordeaux was more than five times that <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules stained with an equivalent concentration of Congo Red.

40|$|Orobanche alba Stephan ex Willd is an achlorophyllous root {{parasite}} rare in Poland. It prefers dry {{and sunny}} slopes, xerothermic grasslands and pastures, mountain pastures, light scrubs, and rock fissures and ledges. The hosts of O. alba include Thymus polytrichus A. ern. ex Borbás, Clinopodium vulgare L. and Origanum vulgare L. The tick and fleshy 10 - 70 cm high stem in this species bears an inflorescence composed of zygomorphic, white or yellow “spotted” flowers covered by purple glandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes {{of this type}} are also borne on {{other parts of the}} plant, i. e. on the stem, scaly leaves, sepals, filaments, and the style. The secondary metabolites secreted by the glandular trichomes are related to defense of plants against the attack of herbivores and pathogens or act as attractants to pollinators or for fruit dispersal. The micromorphology and histochemistry of the glandular trichomes in O. alba were examined using scanning electron and light microscopes. In order to determine the type of secondary metabolites produced by the trichomes, the flowing histochemical assays were used: Sudan III and neutral red for detection of lipophilic compounds, IKI for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> and FeCl 3 for detection of phenolic compounds. The peltate glandular trichomes of O. alba were characterised by a varied length (0. 15 ‑ 0. 48 mm) and different activity phases. The trichome was composed of one larger basal epidermal cell, 1 - 3 hyaline stalk cells with a striated cuticle, a neck cell with a smooth cuticle on the surface, and a globose head formed of 8 - 18 secretory cells arranged in a circle. Many stalk cells of the trichomes, particularly those located on the corolla, contained anthocyanins, which give the trichomes dark carmine colour. In turn, the colour of the heads was dependent on trichome age: the heads were brown in older trichomes and yellow in younger hairs. Secretion was produced by both young and older trichomes. It penetrated through the walls of secretory cells of the heads and accumulated in the subcuticular space, wherefrom it was released as smaller or larger droplets through cuticle micropores. Aging of trichomes was accompanied by shrinkage and corrugation as well as collapse of the secretory cells of the head and stalk cells. Results of histochemical tests showed positive reaction to poliphenols and lipids. Polyphenols occurred abundantly in the heads, neck cells, and stalk cells, particularly in older trichomes, whereas lipophilic compounds were detected in the subcuticular space and in the heads of some trichomes. No starch was detected in the trichomes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 When {{it comes}} to carbohydrate, it has been assumed that only mono- and disaccharides, but not oligo- and polysaccharides, can be tasted. However, because of its {{importance}} in the human diet, oral <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> or its hydrolysis products would be beneficial. The main goal {{of this study was}} to investigate whether humans can detect starch or its hydrolysis products through the gustatory system. In the first study, the taste responsiveness to sugars and maltodextrins were measured. Results showed that maltodextrins could be tasted and that the responsiveness to maltodextrins were highly correlated to one another (r = 0. 69 – 0. 82, P 0. 05). These results were suggestive of a gustatory detection of glucose oligomer and polymer mixtures independent of that to sugars. Nevertheless, maltodextrins contain a broad mixture of glucose oligomers and polymers of varying chain lengths. Thus, it was unclear what target substrates can facilitate the detection of glucose oligomers and/or polymers. The second study thus further elucidated the specific chain length ranges that can be tasted. Results showed that the taste of glucose oligomers (degree of polymerization, DP, 7 and 14) (P 0. 05) can be discriminated from water blanks without the confounding effects of other sensory cues (i. e., odor and texture). Further, when hT 1 R 2 /hT 1 R 3 sweet taste receptors were blocked by lactisole, a known sweet inhibitor, the sweet substances could not be discriminated from blanks (P > 0. 05) while glucose oligomers (DP 7 and 14) still could be (P < 0. 05). This suggests that glucose oligomer detection was independent of the sweet taste receptor mechanism. Accordingly, during a focus group, subjects described the taste of glucose oligomers as 'starchy' while they described sweet substances as ‘sweet’. While these data suggest that humans may have an independent taste receptor that is activated by glucose oligomers, they also raise a question regarding the availability of glucose oligomers in the human diet. Glucose oligomers can be produced in the mouth during oral digestion of starch by way of salivary α-amylase hydrolysis. Thus, the third study investigated whether starch or its hydrolysis products can be tasted and if at all, what factors influence its perception. Results showed that cooking was effective in aiding salivary α-amylase hydrolysis and the amounts of glucose oligomers produced increased with increasing reaction time. Further, subjects with high amylase activity had higher total amounts of glucose oligomers produced than those with low activity. Accordingly, salivary α-amylase activity was found to modulate taste responsiveness. Overall, these studies were the first to demonstrate that humans can taste glucose oligomers. The 'starchy' taste may represent the 'sixth' taste category. A novel taste receptor for complex glucose-based saccharides has been previously proposed in animal models but is yet to be identified. If such exists, its main function is presumably to identify and signal the body of incoming starch, a substance that is an important source of energy...|$|E

Depending on processing conditions, the average molecular weight of the branched polymer was 1. 5 × 10 6 to 1. 1 × 107 Da. Resulting starch fragmentation was shown to strongly impact bowl life and overall sensory quality of the finished corn flakes. Corn flake samples containing high amounts <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> fragmentation were positively correlated to increased water uptake and increased leaching <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> fragments into water. Processing conditions resulting in corn flakes of the same milled flake thickness, but containing different amounts <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> fragmentation, further corresponded to different bowl lives with the flake sample containing the highest amount <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> fragmentation yielding the poorest bowl life. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on the {{distribution}} and pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) tuber. A fresh sweet potato tuber was cut into six equivalent parts. The extractable contents and pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> {{from different parts of}} fresh sweet potato tuber were determined. The results showed that the extractable content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the Middle section of sweet potato tuber is lower than that from the head and the end section of sweet potato tuber. The extractable content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the inner-end part and the outer-Middle part of sweet potato tuber are 16. 2 % and 10. 3 % respectively. The amylose content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> is relatively higher in the Middle section and outer layer of sweet potato tuber. The amylose content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the outer-Middle part and the inner-end part of sweet potato tuber are 29. 5 % and 26. 7 % respectively. Pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from different parts of sweet potato tubers are different from each other. Among them, the starches from inner-end part of sweet potato tuber have the highest viscosities and a lower breakdown...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{processing}} and eating qualities of noodles are largely {{related to the}} quality and quantity of wheat protein (gluten), the importance <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> a major ingredient of wheat flour, is often overlooked. Recent developments on the multilevel structural model <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> have brought new insights into the role <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> for better processing and noodle eating qualities. With critical analysis and discussion, this review outlines the comprehensive relationships between the multilevel (molecular, crystalline, and granular) starch structure, noodle eating qualities, and related physicochemical properties. Further, the major and minor structural features <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> and their contributions toward noodle quality are summarized and presented as a schematic diagram, which shows the effects <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> structure on cooked noodles. These features provide new insights for the scientific community, as well as industry, into the role <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> along with gluten, on the quality of noodles...|$|R
40|$|Although {{steatorrhea}} is {{the most}} obvious symptom of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), enzymatic digestion <b>of</b> protein and <b>starch</b> is also impaired. Low praecaecal digestibility <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> causes a forced microbial fermentation accounting for energy losses and meteorism. To optimise dietetic measures, knowledge of praecaecal digestibility <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> is needed but such information from PEI patients is rare. Minipigs fitted with an ileocaecal fistula with (n= 3) or without (n= 3) pancreatic duct ligation (PL) were used to estimate the rate of praecaecal disappearance (pcD) <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> Different botanical sources <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> (rice, amaranth, potato, and pea) were fed either raw or cooked. In the controls (C), there was an almost complete pcD (> 92 %) except for potato starch (61. 5 %) which was significantly lower. In PL pcD <b>of</b> raw <b>starch</b> was significantly lower for all sources <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> except for amaranth (87. 9 %). Thermal processing increased pcD in PL, reaching values <b>of</b> C for <b>starch</b> from rice, potato, and pea. This study clearly underlines the need for precise specification <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> used for patients with specific dietetic needs like PEI. Data should be generated in suitable animal models or patients as tests in healthy individuals would not have given similar conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{is a type}} of carbohydrate, {{consumed}} within foods or added into foods {{after being}} isolated from its source. It also can be modified and then added into food products. One of the modifications <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> cross-linking, improves its thickening properties. Starch is modified not only for food but also industrial purposes. The concept <b>of</b> incorporating <b>starch</b> into plastic products also requires modification <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> because <b>of</b> its negative effects on water absorption and solubility of starch-plastic composite. ^ Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> in a batch system takes a long time and requires a drying process. Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> by reactive extrusion can reduce reaction time and eliminate the need for a drying process. The objectives of this study were to cross-link starch with phosphorus in an extruder, thereby reducing water absorption and solubility <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> ^ In the first part, starch was extruded with water, 0. 2 M sodium hydroxide and 2. 5 % sodium trimetaphosphate. The effects of moisture content of the feed and screw speed of the extruder on mean residence time, phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> water absorption index, and water solubility index <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> were examined. Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> with incorporated phosphorus, was confirmed by paste viscosity measurement. Minimum reaction time, adjusted by moisture content of feed and screw speed, for cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> was determined. Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> with 0. 2 M sodium hydroxide and 2. 5 % sodium trimetaphosphate reduced the water solubility index but did not reduce the water absorption index significantly. ^ In the second part, starch was extruded with higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide and sodium trimetaphosphate. The effects of sodium hydroxide and sodium trimetaphosphate concentrations, at constant moisture content and screw speed, on phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> water absorption index, water solubility index, radial expansions and bulk densities of extrudates were examined. The amount of phosphorus incorporated into starch was enhanced and water absorption index was reduced 40 % at higher sodium hydroxide and sodium trimetaphosphate concentrations. ^ In the third part, twin-screw and single screw extruders, with and without a mixing elements were used for cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> with phosphorus. The effect of extruder type and mixing element on phosphorylation, water absorption index, and water solubility index were studied. Replacement of the single screw extruder with a twin-screw extruder and use of a mixing element did not enhance the incorporation of phosphorus. ...|$|R

On the basis of microscopic and histochemical studies, using X-glc (5 -Bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-�-D-glycopyranoside) as substrate, �-glucosidase activity was found in half the pollen of the transgenic tobacco plants. <b>Detection</b> <b>of</b> the �-glucosidase (Zm-p 60. 1) was achieved using �-glucosidase histochemical and biochemical assays. The activities of selected enzymes of sucrose metabolism (UDPGpyrophosphorylase) and starch metabolism (ADPG-pyrophosphorylase, starch-phosphorylase, and amylase) were biochemically analyzed. Histochemical studies with potassium iodide revealed that 50 % of the pollen of the positive plants (i. e. tobacco plants expressing �-glucosidase activity) exhibited normal starch accumulation. Biochemical determination <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> revealed that the pollen expressing Zm-p 60. 1 contained significantly lower amount <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> {{in comparison to the}} pollen from negative plants (i. e., tobacco plants not expressing �-glucosidase activity).

40|$|Components <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> {{granules}} {{were investigated}} {{to reveal the}} roles of components in the overall rheology <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels. In a reconstitution study, replacement <b>of</b> insoluble <b>starch</b> with soluble starch decreased the viscosity of pastes and reduced the stickiness of gels. Rice amylopectin fine structure was found to significantly correlate with paste breakdown. Proportion of long chains of amylopectin was negatively correlated and proportion of short chains positively correlated with paste breakdown. Influences <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and other granule-associated proteins on rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels were studied using a normal and three isogenic waxy (a waxy null and two GBSS-containing waxy mutants) maize starches. Starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, reduced paste breakdown and viscosity <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes. The viscoelasticity of pastes and gels was greatly reduced as more starch-granule-associated proteins were removed. Light microscopy of pastes suggested that starch granule-associated proteins influence the rheology of pastes through increasing the rigidity <b>of</b> gelatinized <b>starch</b> granules. The study indicated that starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, can significantly change the rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels despite its low concentration in <b>starch</b> pastes. Location <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granule-associated proteins was revealed using a protein specific dye with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Starch granule-associated proteins {{were found to be}} concentrated in internal concentric rings in potato, maize, and wheat <b>starches.</b> Observation <b>of</b> granule proteins at different optical depths of field showed that proteins were distributed in discrete spheres. Amylose-free potato and waxy corn starch granules showed no internal protein spheres, indicating that the protein spheres are composed of GBSS and are likely associated with location of amylose. GBSS was also found to be strongly associated with isolated gelatinized granule remnants of normal potato, maize and wheat starches while virtually no protein was found in remnants of amylose-free potato and waxy maize starch. Starch granule-associated proteins, including GBSS, were found to be partially lost during alkaline extraction <b>of</b> rice <b>starch.</b> Variation in amount of loss in GBSS and other granule-associated proteins was found among different rice lines. Starch damage caused by ball milling was shown to reduce the viscosity and elastic nature <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes. The study showed that soluble starch, amylopectin, and starch granule-associated proteins have their unique functions and contribute to the overall rheology <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels. Confocal microscopy <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granule-associated proteins provided the structural/locational basis for the rheological function <b>of</b> GBSS in <b>starch</b> pastes. ...|$|R
