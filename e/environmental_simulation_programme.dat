40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} {{and characteristics of}} a large multi-parameter <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> cabin are introduced. Due to the difficulties of control methods and the easily damaged characteristics, control systems for the large multi-parameter <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> cabin are difficult to be controlled quickly and accurately with a classical PID algorithm. Considering the dynamic state characteristics of the <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> test chamber, a lumped parameter model of the control system is established to accurately control the multiple parameters of the environmental chamber and a fuzzy control algorithm combined with expert-PID decision is introduced into the temperature, pressure, and rotation speed control systems. Both simulations and experimental results have shown that compared with classical PID control, this fuzzy-expert control method can decrease overshoot as well as enhance the capacity of anti-dynamic disturbance with robustness. It can also resolve the contradiction between rapidity and small overshoot, and is suitable for application in a large multi-parameter <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> cabin control system...|$|R

40|$|Urban dwellers {{in cities}} located in hot-arid or hothumid regions have greater needs {{to live in}} between outdoor and indoor environments. The {{sustainability}} of urban building design in these regions cannot be fully assessed by indoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> not {{taking into account the}} microclimatic factors of the surrounding urban neighbourhood. We find that the current suites of outdoor and indoor simulation software do not connect with each other to give us a holistic understanding of both outdoor and indoor simulation results. This paper reports on our current development of a methodological framework for bridging the current gap between outdoor and indoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation.</b> Our objective is that assessment of sustainability at an urban neighbourhood level can be carried out more holistically, and hence achieving more valid <b>environmental</b> <b>simulations</b> from an urban  dwelling point of view.

40|$|Abstract – This {{paper is}} about {{the concept of the}} {{combination}} of renewable energy parks and water desalination. During the energy production a lot of waste heat is produced which is in the majority of cases unused. The needed (waste) heat for the water desalination unit can be generated with biomass power plants, geo thermal or solar power. So the idea is to use this unused energy to convert saltwater into freshwater. This water can be used to irrigate fields or to produce common products. The advantage is that the produced water and energy can be used independent from each other. The current project {{is about the}} optimization between the water desalination unit from the company Terrawater [5] and the produced waste heat from a renewable energy source. At first there will be coded a <b>simulation</b> <b>programme</b> for a physical – mathematical model. Furthermore a control programme will be written which works together with the <b>simulation</b> <b>programme</b> to control the heat flow volume from the power plant or heat generator to the desalination unit to get the best performance and a best amount of freshwater.

Accentuation of slosh activity in free flight is demonstrated from both simulation results and flight records. The requirement to consider engine inertia carefully in roll loop analysis is highlighted. Results of structural response when flexural mode is excited are presented.
