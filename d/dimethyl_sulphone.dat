No H/D and 160 / 180 exchanges take place thermally or photochemically under the reaction conditions applied.

40|$|Dialkyl sulphones, RSO 2 R, {{have been}} {{considered}} as model compounds for the radiolysis of poly(olefin sulphone) s, {A figure is presented}. They show preferential C-S scission and SO 2 elimination, attribute to the relatively low strengths of these bonds. Combination of the alkyl radicals, which are produced singly or in pairs according to whether one or two C-S scissions occur in one molecule, competes with hydrogen abstraction from sulphone molecules. The latter is favoured for single C-S scissions and as {{the size of the}} radical increases and hence its mobility decreases. An important degradation reaction in radiolysis is considered to be ionization to form the cation radical of the dialkyl sulphone, followed by a single C-S scission to produce the alkyl radical and the complementary alkyl sulphonyl cation, which may undergo scission of the remaining C-S bond to produce SO 2. GC/MS studies of the volatile products from <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> have shown that radiolysis results in a complexity of fragmentation and combination reactions, involving scission of most bonds in the molecule.

The investigations have provided new insights into the oxidation mechanisms of both DMS and DMSO, e. g., {{it has been shown that}} interactions of the DMS-OH adduct with O 2 form DMSO in the absence of NO and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (CH 3 SO 2 CH 3 : DMSO 2) in its presence. The data support an SO 2 yield of around 70 % from OH + DMS in the remote marine atmosphere. Investigations on the OH-radical initiated oxidation of dimethyl sulphoxide (CH 3 SOCH 3 : DMSO) have shown for the first time that methane sulphinic acid (CH 3 S(O) OH: MSIA) is the major product. Within the experimental conditions employed in the experiments only a modest dependence of the aerosol yield on temperature and initial NO concentration was observed. The experiments support that sulphuric acid formed from OH + SO 2 is the major component of the aerosol with only minor contributions from MSA and MSIA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{characterized}} by the progressive accumulation of various potential toxic solutes. Furthermore, uremic plasma is a complex mixture hampering accurate determination of uremic toxin levels and the identification of novel uremic solutes. METHODS: In this study, we applied (1) H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, following three distinct deproteinization strategies, to determine differences in the plasma metabolic status of stage 3 - 4 CKD patients and healthy controls. Moreover, the human renal proximal tubule cell line (ciPTEC) was used to study the influence of newly indentified uremic solutes on renal phenotype and functionality. RESULTS: Protein removal via ultrafiltration and acetonitrile precipitation are complementary techniques and both are required to obtain a clear metabolome profile. This new approach, revealed that a total of 14 metabolites were elevated in uremic plasma. In addition to confirming the retention of several previously identified uremic toxins, including p-cresyl sulphate, two novel uremic retentions solutes were detected, namely <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DMSO 2) and 2 -hydroxyisobutyric acid (2 -HIBA). Our results show that these metabolites accumulate in non-dialysis CKD patients from 9 +/- 7 microM (control) to 51 +/- 29 microM and from 7 (0 - 9) microM (control) to 32 +/- 15 microM, respectively. Furthermore, exposure of ciPTEC to clinically relevant concentrations of both solutes resulted in an increased protein expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin with more than 10 % (p< 0. 05). Moreover, the loss of epithelial characteristics significantly correlated with a loss of glucuronidation activity (Pearson r = - 0. 63; p< 0. 05). In addition, both solutes did not affect cell viability nor mitochondrial activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of sample preparation techniques in the identification of uremic retention solutes using (1) H-NMR spectroscopy, and provide insight into the negative impact of DMSO 2 and 2 -HIBA on ciPTEC, which could aid in understanding the progressive nature of renal disease...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{dimethyl}} sulphide (DMS) and its oxidation products, methane {{sulphonic acid}} (MSA), sulphate, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DMSO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in the atmosphere have been made during all seasons of 1988 / 1990 at coastal sites in northwest Scotland and Eire. The annual average air concentration of DMS was estimated from results obtained on 92 days in 1989 / 1990 to be 58 ng (S) m− 3 and that of MSA to be 6 ng (S) m− 34. Backward air mass trajectories were used for each sampling period to explain the observed concentrations {{in terms of the}} origins of the sampled air. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were observed for DMS with maximum concentrations > 300 ng (S) m− 3 occurring at night and during the spring in air of oceanic origin. Maximum MSA concentrations (up to 120 ng (S) m− 3) were observed during the spring. Using a steady state approximation, the sea-to-air flux of DMS from the Atlantic north of 45 ° was estimated to be 0. 93 μmol m− 2 d− 1 or 96 Gg (S) yr− 1. Three methods were used to correct the observed air concentrations of the various sulphur species for anthropogenic emissions. The resultant flux of biogenic sulphur into the United Kingdom from the North Atlantic, net of any anthropogenic sulphur, was estimated to be 30 - 96 Gg (S) yr− 1, or 2 - 5 % of the total anthropogenic emission rate of sulphur from the U. K. A simple 10 -step model was used to describe the equilibria existing between the various sulphur species and CO 2 in cloud water at cloudwater concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 2. 5 g m− 3 and the resultantacidity calculated. Values of pH as low as 3. 4 were predicted, with MSA having a negligible effect and sulphate dominating. Biogenic sulphur species from the North Atlantic may therefore make a small but quantifiable contribution to the atmospheric sulphur budget of the U. K. and may {{play an important role in}} determining rainwater acidity in the west of the country...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} product {{study has}} been performed on the OH radical initiated oxidation of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) under different conditions of temperature, partial pressure of O 2 and NO x concentration. The products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of DMS have been investigated under NO x free conditions at temperatures of 284, 295 and 306 ± 2 K and the O 2 partial pressures of 20, 200 and 500 mbar. The major identified sulphur-containing products were DMSO, SO 2 and methane sulphonic acid (MSA). Evidence has been found {{for the formation of}} methane sulphinic acid (MSIA) in considerable yield. Formation of methane thiol formate (MTF) and carbonyl sulphide (OCS) has been also observed. The variation of the formation yield of DMSO and SO 2 with temperature and O 2 partial pressure {{has been found to be}} consistent with a mechanism involving both addition and abstraction channels of the initial reaction. The found formation yields of DMSO for 284 K (46. 3 ± 5. 0 %), 295 K (34. 8 ± 7. 6 %) and 306 K (24. 4 ± 2. 8 %), at 200 mbar O 2, give evidence for the predominance of the addition pathway at low temperature. High overall molar formation yields of SO 2, about 90 % at all temperatures, leads to the conclusion that further oxidation of the products in both the addition and abstraction channels results mainly in SO 2 production under the experimental conditions of this study. The major sulphur-containing products identified in the presence of NO x were SO 2, DMSO, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DMSO 2), MSA, methane sulphonyl peroxy nitrate (MSPN) and OCS. The variation of the product yields with NO x concentration at different temperatures was also found to be consistent with the occurrence of both addition and abstraction channels. It was found that increasing the initial NO concentration depresses the DMSO, SO 2 and OCS formation yields and enhances those of DMSO 2, MSA and MSPN. The branching ratio for DMSO formation was found to decrease with increasing initial NO and to decrease with increase of the temperature. This behaviour is expected for a reaction sequence involving formation of a thermally unstable peroxy radical adduct and its subsequent reaction with NO with formation of an oxy-alcoxy species which can react with molecular O 2 to form DMSO 2. The molar formation yield of SO 2 was found to decrease with increasing both the temperature and initial NO x. A study of the gas phase oxidation of DMSO by OH radicals has been performed under conditions similar to those for DMS. Formation of MSIA in a very high yield was found. The results show quite definitely that MSIA is the major oxidation product of DMSO and that its measured yield is independent of the reaction conditions. Formation of DMSO 2, SO 2, MSA and MSPN has been observed. The observed behaviour of these products supports a formation mechanism involving secondary chemistry of MSIA initiated either by OH or by peroxy radicals...|$|E

40|$|Heating milk to high {{temperatures}} such as 140 ºC, {{as used in}} ultra high temperature (UHT) processing, causes physical and chemical changes in the milk. The production of a cooked flavour is a major change which reduces consumer acceptance of the UHT milk. It has been correlated {{with the formation of}} volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) that result from milk proteins, principally the whey proteins β-lactoglobulin, containing the the sulphur amino acids cystine, cysteine and methionine. The VSCs in milk, whose concentrations are in the parts per billion to parts per million range, are highly reactive, easily oxidised, and sensitive to heat during thermal processing and analysis; this makes them a challenge to analyse. A sensitive method based on gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection coupled with headspace sampling by solid phase microextraction (SPME/GC/PFPD) was developed to detect these compounds in commercial UHT milk and to investigate their production and disappearance during heating and storage. The SPME/GC/PFPD procedure was optimised using different extraction time (15 min, 30 min, & 60 min) – temperature (30 oC, 45 oC & 60 oC) combinations with CAR/PDMS fibre to obtain maximum sensitivity. A short extraction time (15 min) at low temperature (30 oC) was chosen to provide high sensitivity for detecting all VSCs in UHT milk without introducing artefactual VSCs. The extraction method and GC run time (16 min) make this method simple and fast. Nine VSCs were detected in commercial indirectly processed UHT milk, skim and whole. These are hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), carbonyl sulphide (COS), methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulphide (DMS), carbon disulphide (CS 2), dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (Me 2 SO 2) and dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS). An additional unknown compound was detected but could not be identified by GC/MS because its concentration was below the detection limit of the MS detector. The concentrations of H 2 S, DMS and DMTS were higher than their threshold values indicating their importance in milk flavour, especially cooked flavour. Several {{attempts have been made to}} reduce the cooked flavour in UHT milk. In the current research, the use of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) to oxidise the VSCs and thereby reduce cooked flavour was investigated. H 2 O 2 is used as a milk preservative and is generally recognised as safe (GRAS) in USA. Several concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0. 001 %, 0. 005 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 02 % & 0. 03 %) were added to milk to assess its effects on VSCs and on whey proteins denaturation in UHT milk. H 2 O 2 effectively reduced the concentration of all VSCs, except DMDS which was increased, presumably by oxidation of MeSH. H 2 S was completely oxidised or reduced below its threshold value. Low concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0. 001 % & 0. 005 %) had no effect on, or decreased, the extent of denaturation of β-lactoglobulin when added after or before processing, respectively. Some UHT plants use severe heating conditions, leading to high levels of denaturation of whey proteins, particularly β-Lg, the main source of the VSCs in milk. Correlations between heat severity, β-Lg denaturation and individual VSC generation were investigated in milk batch-heated at 80 oC and 90 oC, and UHT milk processed at 120 - 150 oC. In accordance with previous reports, β-Lg was more heat-sensitive than α-La. Only five VSCs were detected. The concentrations of H 2 S and MeSH correlated well with denaturation of β-Lg and α-La. DMS concentration correlated well with β-Lg in UHT milk but not in the batch-heated milk. CS 2 did not show a good correlation with heat intensity and appeared to plateau out after a certain level of heating. Conversely, COS and MeSH seemed to require a certain minimum amount of heat before generation commenced; this corresponded to denaturation of β-Lg above 49 % and 89 % respectively at 80 oC. The higher concentrations of DMS and H 2 S in UHT milk compared with batch-heated samples having similar degrees of denaturation suggested other possible sources for their production and the importance of the heat severity in generating them. For example, at high heat intensity, S-methylmethionine and thiamine could be sources of DMS and H 2 S respectively. Furthermore, in whole milk as used in this work, milk fat globule membrane proteins are another source of VSCs. The outcome of this study will help UHT manufacturers to understand the production and disappearance of the VSCs in commercial UHT milk and how to adjust the processing conditions to avoid generation of cooked flavour. Additionally, the promising results of using low concentrations of H 2 O 2 to oxidise the VSCs will provide the industry with another means of reducing cooked flavour. Before H 2 O 2 use is implemented in UHT processing, future studies are required to evaluate all of its effects, including sporicidal effects. Overall, this study makes a contribution to finding a solution to the cooked flavour problem in UHT milk, thereby increasing market share of this milk in countries such as Australia, the UK and North America where cooked flavour is the main barrier to its consumer acceptance...|$|E
40|$|Solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{has been}} widely used {{in a variety of}} sample {{matrices}} and proven to be a simple, fast and solvent-free sample preparation technique. A challenging limitation in the further development of this technique has been the insufficient sensitivity for some trace applications. This limitation lies mainly in the small volume of the extraction phase. According to the fundamentals of SPME, different strategies can be employed to achieve higher sensitivity for SPME sampling. These include cooling down the extraction phase, preparing a high capacity particle-loading extraction phase, as well as using a thin film with high surface area-to-volume ratio as the extraction phase. In this thesis, four sampling approaches were developed for high sensitivity sampling by employing cold fiber, thin film, cooling membrane and particle loading membrane as sampling tools. These proposed methods were applied to liquid, solid and particularly trace gas analysis. First, a fully automated cold fiber device that improves the sensitivity of the technique by cooling down the extraction phase was developed. This device was coupled to a GERSTEL® MultiPurpose Sampler (MPS 2), and applied to the analysis of volatiles and semi-volatiles in aqueous and solid matrices. The proposed device was thoroughly evaluated for its extraction performance, robustness, reproducibility and reliability by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The evaluation of the automated cold fiber device was carried out using a group of compounds characterized by different volatilities and polarities. Extraction efficiency and analytical figures of merit were compared to commercial SPME fibers. In the analysis of aqueous standard samples, the automated cold fiber device showed a significant improvement in extraction efficiency when compared to commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and non-cooled cold fiber. This was achieved due to the low temperature of the coating during sampling. Results from the cold fiber and commercial divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber analysis of solid sample matrices were obtained and compared. Results demonstrated that the temperature gap between the sample matrix and the coating significantly improved the distribution coefficient, and consequently, the extraction amount. The newly automated cold fiber device presents a platform for headspace analysis of volatiles and semi-volatiles for a large number of samples, with improved throughput and sensitivity. Thin film microextraction (TFME) improves the sensitivity by employing a membrane with a high surface area-to-volume ratio as the extraction phase. In Chapter 3, a simple non-invasive sample preparation method using TFME is proposed for sampling volatile skin emissions. Evaluation experiments were conducted to test the reproducibility of the sampling device, the effect of the membrane size, and the method for storage. Results supported the reproducibility of multi-membrane sampling, and demonstrated that sampling efficiency can be improved using a larger membrane. However, ability to control the sampling environment and time was proved to be critical in order to obtain reliable information; the in vivo skin emission sampling was also influenced by skin metabolism and environmental conditions. Next, the method of storage was fully investigated for the membrane device before and after sampling. This investigation of storage permitted the sampling and instrument analysis to be conducted at different locations. Finally, the developed skin sampling device was applied in the identification of dietary biomarkers after garlic and alcohol ingestion. In this experiment, the previously reported potential biomarkers <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphone,</b> allyl methyl sulfide and allyl mercaptan were detected after garlic intake, and ethanol was detected after the ingestion of alcohol. Experiments were also conducted in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from upper back, forearm and back thigh of the body on the same individual. Results showed that 27 compounds can be detected from all of the 3 locations. However, these compounds were quantitatively different. In addition, sampling of the upper back, where the density of sebaceous glands is relatively high, detected more compounds than the other regions. In Chapter 4, a novel sample preparation method that combines the advantages of cold fiber and thin film was developed to achieve the high extraction efficiency necessary for high sensitivity gas sampling. A cooling sampling device was developed for the thin film microextraction. Method development for this sampling approach included evaluation of membrane temperature effect, membrane size effect, air flow rate and humidity effect. Results showed that high sensitivity for equilibrium sampling can be achieved by either cooling down the membrane and/or using a large volume extraction phase. On the other hand, for pre-equilibrium extraction, in which the extracted amount was mainly determined by membrane surface area and diffusion coefficient, high sensitivity was obtained by thin membranes with a large surface area and/or high sampling flow rate. In addition, humidity evaluations showed no significant effect on extraction efficiency due to the absorption property of the liquid extraction phase. Next, the limit of detection (LOD) and reproducibility of the developed cooling membrane gas sampling method were evaluated. LOD with a membrane radius of 1 cm at room temperature sampling were 9. 24 ng/L, 0. 12 ng/L, 0. 10 ng/L for limonene, cinnamaldehyde and 2 -pentadecanone, respectively. Intra- and inter-membrane sampling reproducibility had a relative standard deviation (RSD%) lower than 8 % and 13 %, respectively. Results uniformly demonstrated that the proposed cooling membrane device could serve as a powerful tool for gas in trace analysis. In Chapter 5, a particle-loading membrane was developed to combine advantages of high distribution coefficient and high surface area geometry, and applied in trace gas sampling. Bar coating, a simple and easy preparation method was applied in the preparation of the DVB/PDMS membrane. Membrane morphology, particle ratio, membrane size and extraction efficiency were fully evaluated for the prepared membrane. Results show that the DVB particles are uniformly distributed in the PDMS base. The addition of a DVB particle enhanced the stiffness of the membrane to some extent, and improved the extraction capacity of the membrane. Extraction capacity for benzene was enhanced by a factor of 100 when the membrane DVB particle ratio increased from 0 % to 30 %. Additionally, the prepared DVB/PDMS membrane provided higher extraction efficiency than pure PDMS membrane and DVB/PDMS fiber, especially for highly volatile and polar compounds. The high reproducibility of the prepared DVB/PDMS membrane in air sampling demonstrated the advantage of the bar coating preparation method, and also permitted quantitative analysis. Last, the prepared particle-loading membrane was applied to semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis of indoor and outdoor air, respectively. Both the equilibrium calibration method and diffusion-based calibration method were proposed for the quantitative analysis. Results showed that the high capacity particle-loading membrane can be used for monitoring trace analytes such as perfume components and air pollutants...|$|E
