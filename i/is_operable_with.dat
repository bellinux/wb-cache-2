5000|$|The enteric {{nervous system}} {{is one of}} the main {{divisions}} of the nervous system and is the main focus of neurogastroenterology. The enteric nervous system refers to the entire system of neurons that govern the gastrointestinal system. [...] It is capable of operating independently of the brain and spinal cord, but does rely on innervation from the autonomic nervous system via the vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia in healthy subjects. However, studies have shown that the system <b>is</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> a severed vagus nerve. [...] The neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor functions of the system, in addition to the secretion of gastrointestinal enzymes. These neurons communicate through many neurotransmitters similar to the CNS, including acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. The large presence of serotonin and dopamine in the gut are key areas of research for neurogastroenterologists.|$|E
5000|$|The RCIC system {{operates}} on high-pressure steam from the reactor itself, and thus <b>is</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> no electric power other than battery power {{to operate the}} control valves. Those turn the RCIC on and off as necessary to maintain correct water levels in the reactor. (If run continuously, the RCIC would overfill the reactor and send water down its own steam supply line.) During a station blackout (where all off-site power is lost and the diesel generators fail) the RCIC system may be [...] "black started" [...] with no AC and manually activated. The RCIC system condenses its steam into the reactor suppression pool. The RCIC can make up this water loss, from either of two sources: a makeup water tank located outside containment, or the wetwell itself. RCIC is not designed to maintain reactor water level during a LOCA or other leak. Similar to HPCI, the RCIC turbine can be run in recirculation mode to remove steam from the reactor and help depressurize the reactor.|$|E
50|$|All of the L-4 {{variants}} {{have the}} same layout and are all largely built of composite materials. They are high-wing monoplanes with twin engines mounted close to the fuselage {{and on top of}} the wing. The wings have straight taper on both edges and almost square tips. The L-4 has a pair of flaps on each wing. Its hull has two steps and there are small winglets at waterlevel just aft of the trailing edge. The cabin extends from below the leading edge rearwards to the winglets. Fixed floats under the wings stabilze the L-4 on water; it <b>is</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> waves to 400 mm (15 in) high. The most unusual feature of the L-4 is the empennage arrangement. There are twin fins, mounted on the fuselage and extended forward with long, curved dorsal fillets, separated at the base by the full fuselage width and leaning slightly outwards. The fins carry conventional rudders and the single tailplane is mounted upon the fin tips, extending well beyond them. Tailplane and single piece elevator together are trapezoidal; there is a trim tab at the centre of the elevator. The L-4 has a conventional undercarriage for land use, all three wheels and the water rudder being retractable.|$|E

The next generation of top-level synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems will comprise, among others, high resolution and long-range imaging capabilities, highly sensitive ground moving target indication and a multitude of sophisticated operational modes. The variety of tasks can be fulfilled only {{by the use of}} a reconfigurable phased array antenna together with a comprehensive wideband system design and a multichannel capability. At FGAN a new experimental X-band radar has been conceived, which will possess in its final upgrade an electronically steerable phased array consisting of 16 autonomous and reconfigurable subapertures, five independent receive channels, and a total signal bandwidth of about 1. 8 GHz. The sensor is called PAMIR (Phased Array Multifunctional Imaging Radar). It is envisaged to demonstrate SAR imaging at a very high resolution and for a long range. The fine resolution will also be achieved with inverse SAR (ISAR) imaging of ground moving objects. Furthermore, the number of receive channels will allow ground-moving target indication (GMTI) by space-time adaptive processing and single-pass interferometric SAR (IfSAR) with a very high 3 -D resolution. In its current stage of extension PAMIR <b>is</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> one receive channel and a mechanically steerable antenna array.

40|$|Targeted cancer therapy {{concepts}} often aim at {{the induction}} of adjuvant antitumor immunity or stimulation of tumor cell apoptosis. There is further evidence that combined application of immune stimulating and tumor apoptosis-inducing compounds elicits a synergistic antitumor effect. Here, we describe the development and characterization of bifunctional fusion proteins consisting of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain derived from the CD 40 -specific monoclonal antibody G 28 - 5 that is fused to the N-terminus of stabilized trimeric soluble variants of the death ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). As shown before by us and others for other cell surface antigen-targeted scFv-TRAIL fusion proteins, scFv:G 28 -TRAIL displayed an enhanced capacity to induce apoptosis upon CD 40 binding. Studies with scFv:G 28 fusion proteins of TRAIL mutants that discriminate between the two TRAIL death receptors, TRAILR 1 and TRAILR 2, further revealed that the CD 40 binding-dependent mode of apoptosis induction of scFv:G 28 -TRAIL <b>is</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> {{each of the two}} TRAIL death receptors. Binding of scFv:G 28 -TRAIL fusion proteins to CD 40 not only result in enhanced TRAIL death receptor signaling but also in activation of the targeted CD 40 molecule. In accordance with the latter, the scFv:G 28 -TRAIL fusion proteins triggered strong CD 40 -mediated maturation of dendritic cells. The CD 40 -targeted TRAIL fusion proteins described in this study therefore represent a novel type of bifunctional fusion proteins that couple stimulation of antigen presenting cells and apoptosis induction...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionReviewed are {{the results}} of the {{emergent}} treatment of effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein. The protocol calls for immediate thrombolysis, followed by surgery {{at the time of the}} acute event. The one-stage procedure includes decompression of the thoracic inlet by subclavicular removal of the first rib, subclavius muscle, scalenectomy, and vein patch plasty of the stenotic segment of the vein. MethodsBetween July 1985 through June 2006, 114 patients presented with Paget-Schroetter syndrome (effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein), 97 of which (group I) were seen â‰¤ 2 weeks of onset of symptoms. They underwent an emergent protocol treatment in which thrombolysis is immediately followed by surgery at the time of the acute event. In addition, another 17 patients (group II) were referred to our institution after being treated elsewhere with initial thrombolysis, but with surgery deferred a mean 34 days (range, 2 weeks to 3 months) after the initial event. All patients underwent the same lytic and surgical protocol. Operability was determined by the findings on the venogram. Routine postoperative anticoagulation for 8 weeks was implemented with warfarin and clopidogrel. ResultsThere was 100 % success in re-establishing the flow and normal caliber of the subclavian vein in the 97 patients in group I. Seven patients showed some residual stenosis that required balloon plasty and implant of a stent. Postoperative duplex ultrasound imaging documented patency in all 97 patients (100 %). The 17 patients with delayed surgery (group II) showed progression of the fibrosis, with vein obstruction in 12 (70 %). Only five patients (29 %) <b>were</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> successful results. The remaining 12 patients were inoperable owing to extensive fibrosis and occlusion of the inflow, and all 12 have remained disabled for the use of their arm. ConclusionsThe emergent approach to treat Paget-Schroetter syndrome seems to render the optimal results, with 100 % effectiveness in re-establishing venous flow and normal caliber to the vessel. When properly conducted, this operation avoids the use of stents or balloon plasty with excellent long-term results, leaving the patients unrestricted for physical activities...|$|R
40|$|In {{women with}} {{recurrent}} cervical cancer, {{there is a}} 52 % 5 -year survival rate when exenteration of the centrally placed tumor is performed. If not exenterated, the 2 -year survival rate is less than 2 %. The {{purpose of this study}} is to ascertain whether CT can predict inoperability reliably leading to a reduction in operations which do not have a curative outcome. The records of patients with recurrence of cervical cancer who underwent laparotomies for exenteration over the last 10 years under the care of one surgeon were reviewed. The CT scans were retrospectively assessed by two radiologists without knowledge of the subsequent outcome of the laparotomy. CT scans on 31 patients were reviewed, 21 of whom underwent a radical surgical procedure. Using CT criteria, 9 cases were felt to <b>be</b> <b>operable</b> <b>with</b> a curative intent and the remaining 22 cases were deemed to be inoperable. The sensitivity of CT prediction of inoperability is 93 % (95 %Cl: 66 - 100 %) and the specificity is 47 % (95 %Cl: 23 - 72 %). In three cases ascites was the only abnormal finding other than the central pelvic mass and in all of these cases a radical procedure with clear resection margins was possible. When the group with ascites alone was not considered to have peritoneal disease underlying the ascites, the sensitivity of CT prediction of inoperability is 93 % (95 %Cl: 66 - 100 %) and the specificity of 65 % (95 % Cl: 38 - 86 %). If, in addition, lymphadenopathy is not taken as definite evidence of inoperability, the specificity rises to 82 % (95 %Cl: 57 - 96 %). A high quality CT scan is highly specific for predicting inoperability based on extension of the tumor to the pelvic side walls, encasement of adjacent vessels or ureteric dilatation and so should be a major tool in assessing women for radical surgical treatment of recurrent cervical cancer. If ascites is the only abnormal finding other than the central pelvic mass then exploration should be undertaken. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
