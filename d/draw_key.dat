5000|$|Going further, orientations (rotations) {{of objects}} and parts of objects can be {{interpolated}} as well as parts of complete characters. This process mimics that used in early cartoon films. Master animators would <b>draw</b> <b>key</b> frames of the film, then, junior animators would draw the in-between frames. This is called inbetweening or tweening and the overall process is called [...] "key frame animation". To make these motions appear realistic, interpolation algorithms have been sought which follow, or approximate real life motion dynamics. This applies to things such as the motion of arms and legs from frame to frame, or the motion of all parts of a face, given {{the motion of the}} important, key points of the face. Defining the motion of key strands of hair, spread around an animal, can be made into full fur. Using custom algorithms, motions with unique, unnatural and entertaining visual characteristics can be formed. The color of an object can be defined by key color-locations or frames allowing the computation of smooth color gradients around an object or varying in time. Algorithms such as the Kochanek-Bartels spline provide additional adjustment parameters which allow customizing the in-between behavior to suit a wide variety of situations. The article on tweening currently demonstrates several of these.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the decline}} in fossil fuel reservoirs, the {{researchers}} emphasized more on the production of biogas from organic waste. Producing the renewable energy from biodegradable waste helps to overcome the energy crisis and solid waste management, done by anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is controlled breakdown of organic matter into methane gas (60 %), carbon dioxide (40 %), trace components along with digested used as soil conditioner. However there is vast dearth of literature regarding the design considerations. The batch digestion system yields a cost-effective and economically viable means for conversion of the food waste to useful energy. It is therefore recommended that such process can be increasingly employed {{in order to get}} and simultaneously protect the environment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{open up the}} topic of ethical {{corporate}} identity: what {{we believe to be}} a new, as well as highly salient, field of inquiry for scholarship in ethics and corporate social responsibility. Taking as our starting point Balmer and Greyser’s (2003) AC 2 ID test model of corporate identity – a pragmatic tool of identity management – we explore the specificities of an ethical form of corporate identity. We <b>draw</b> <b>key</b> insights from conceptualisations of Corporate Social Responsibility and social orientated theories of business. We argue ethical identity potentially takes us beyond the personification of the corporation as agent. Instead, ethical identity is seen to be formed relationally, between parties, within a community of business and social exchange. Extending the AC 2 ID test model, we suggest the management of ethical identity requires a more socially, dialogically embedded kind of corporate practice and greater levels of critical reflexivity...|$|E

40|$|Integrated energy {{management}} {{at both the}} district and building scales can potentially improve multi-level energy efficiency, but such a solution requires the exchange and analysis of energy performance information from different stakeholders. With the complexities of {{energy management}}, there are numerous potential stakeholders and {{a considerable amount of}} information to consider. Therefore, a primary challenge is the development of a method that identifies the key stakeholders and extracts key information that supports their performance goals. In this paper, a systematic approach to identify stakeholders and key performance indicators (KPIs) is proposed to <b>draw</b> <b>key</b> information for multi-level energy performance analysis. Firstly, a three-task method for the identification and prioritization of stakeholders is suggested; secondly, a bi-index method to select the KPIs that underpin the stakeholders? performance goals is defined; finally, the proposed methodology is validated using a case study. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the methodology and illustrates that the selected KPIs contribute to the attainment of key information required to carry out a multi-level energy performance analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} the {{institutional}} arrangements for facilitating electricity regional cooperation. We begin by discussing the theory of international trade cooperation in electricity, {{with a view to}} discussing what preconditions might be important in facilitating wide area trading across national borders. We then discuss two sets of case studies. The first set of case studies focuses on three regional developing country power pools – the Southern African Power pool (SAPP), West African Power pool (WAPP) and the Central American Power Market (SIEPAC). The second set focuses on three regional power pools in more developed countries – PJM in the United States, the Single Electricity Market (SEM) in Ireland and the South East Europe market (ECSEE). These cases highlight both the potential and difficulty of having cross-jurisdictional power pools. In the light of the theory and evidence we present, we <b>draw</b> <b>key</b> lessons in the areas of: preconditions for trading; necessary institutional arrangements; practicalities of timetabling; reasons to be hopeful about future prospects; and suggestions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Care {{services}} for children depend on a limited supply of resources; {{it is vital that}} these are used to best effect. This book considers the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these services and their contribution to children's well-being. The book presents the findings of a set of original research studies. It looks at services provided by the statutory, for-profit and voluntary sectors, examining the way they are delivered and how resources are distributed. It examines the cost of providing particular services, {{the extent to which they}} improve outcomes for children and the degree to which they can be considered cost-effective. It explores what changes can and should be made to improve efficiency, paying particular attention to the possible contributions of early intervention and better co-ordination. From the research findings, Jennifer Beecham and Ian Sinclair <b>draw</b> <b>key</b> messages for practice for the use of resources and for future research in this area. This is an invaluable book for those practitioners, policy makers, managers, who are concerned with social care {{services for}} childre...|$|E
