Live Media streaming, in particular, is a promising technology for providing services such as live news clips, live sports. To avoid service interruption when the users keep moving, proper data management strategies must be engaged. In an earlier paper, the ideas and benefits of two-level cooperative media streaming with headlight pre fetching and <b>dynamic</b> <b>chaining</b> were demonstrated and they using static bit rate delivery. In this paper, we propose the QoS-based dynamic adaptation techniques for the flexible employment and smooth integration of headlight pre-fetching and <b>dynamic</b> <b>chaining</b> to continuously provide quality streaming services to mobile users. And also it provides Variable bit rate delivery. We propose a new mechanism Upload Cache in Edge Networks brings benefit for both end users and service providers. For end users, it shortens the duration while user must stay online for uploading their generated content. Also for service providers, it reduces peak traffic volume between edge networks and data centers by slightly shifting the upload timing without incurring much extra latency overhead added. Our analysis with replaying the captured traffic shows that this mechanism reduces upload tether time of 24 % end users {{by more than half}} and flattens the traffic peak for the access service provider by 37 %. To avoid disconnection and/or service breakdown when the users keep moving, proper data management strategies must be taken by all parties. We propose a two level framework and a set of new techniques for cooperative media streaming in mobile environments. General Term...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is to understand the environment of <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> on oil and gas industry in Malaysia by looking into the <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> capabilities and <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> performance. Oil and gas enterprise-wide optimization span a large spectrum in a supply chain, from the strategic to the tactical to the operational level and other various functions in the supply chain network, from purchasing of the raw materials through the refinery activities to the distribution and sales. Integrated and coordinated decision making across various geographically distributed refinery activities and storage sites also offers additional challenges to refinery operations optimization. While refinery facilities management is an integral part of enterprise-wide optimization, transportation logistics and finished product distribution management remain important parts of the oil and gas supply chain. Although, technical advancement and time were the core values aiming only for fast exploration and higher production of oil and gas, supply chain in the oil and gas industry can either make or break the project if careful attention and precautions are not taken seriously by players in an industry. Increasing economic volatility has severely disrupted the supply chains of companies across industries. Rapid swings in the availability and price of key commodities, major currency fluctuations, disturbance in financial markets, disruptive geopolitical events and continued development of customer channels on a global basis have conspired to place unique pressure on the way these companies source, manufacture and distribute products. Therefore, this study is to identify and understand the <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> capabilities and <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> performance as a whole perspective of <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chain</b> on the oil and gas industry practices.

40|$|Geographic {{information}} (GI) {{services are}} increasingly {{the state of}} the art in geoprocessing, promising novel geospatial solutions, products and services. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>chaining</b> of GI services however, presents exciting quality of service (QoS) challenges. Consequently, sustainable use of GI services demands careful consideration of the diverse user requirements and the complexities of dynamic service chaining in view of the QoS limitations of the Internet. An initial and necessary step towards provision of QoS guarantees in Internet GIS is QoS-aware service chaining, where services are discovered and composed on the basis of their non-functional quality characteristics. The paper presents an architecture for QoSaware service chaining and defines an extensible QoS model for GI services. Further, to facilitate the successful evolution of GI enterprise into effective service providing nodes on the GI service infrastructure, an integration framework for GI enterprises presented. While the provision of hard QoS guarantees on the Internet remains elusive, QoS-aware service chaining will greatly improve the quality experienced by Internet GI applications and users. ...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{the field}} of cloud {{computing}} and networking have led to development of Marketplaces (e. g., Awesim) that support Advanced Manufacturing enterprises consisting of Apps. These Marketplaces host Apps that perform simulation and modeling on specialized designs (e. g., pipes, automobile parts). However, the salient limitation in these App Marketplaces is the lack of a development environment that supports effective runtime capabilities for �??Agile Manufacturing�?? that efficiently and cost-effectively integrates several Apps when building innovative products. To address this problem, we propose a new Software-as-a-Service based App Runtime for the Marketplace environment that can be utilized for agile development of �??Apps�?? that involve high-performance modeling and simulation.

40|$|The {{explosive}} growth in Internet-powered services has fueled {{the quest for}} finding new killer Internet-based applications. This quest has often led to applications based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), especially in the emerging field of the Mobile Internet. Unfortunately, the traditional GIS model falls short of accommodating the requirements {{and needs of the}} Internet environment. A more flexible GIS model is required to support the growing need for sharing increasingly available yet distributed geographic data, and for facilitating the integration of GIS with other information systems. Such a model will be especially beneficial for scientific research and engineering modeling as well as state and federal government settings, where tightly coupled hierarchical systems are unlikely to have the desired breadth and flexibility. This next generation flexible GIS model is seen to deliver GIS functionalities as independently-provided, yet interoperable, services over the Internet. Such services can then be dynamically chained to construct customized applications. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for building a scalable and extensible infrastructure that can support and facilitate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>chaining</b> of distributed services. Towards that goal, the thesis evaluates and contrasts a set of alternative architectures. In doing so, it identifies the key elements and players, and focuses on issues pertaining to error handling, back-tracing of data and services in transactions, as well as service discovery and network management. A detailed analysis of a typical use case shows that a federated architecture is the most promising in terms of meeting the scalability, extensibility and flexibility requirements of the infrastructure. In this context, the thesis stresses the necessity of service and catalog interoperability, the need for GIS metadata standards which comply with general IT standards, and the usefulness of XML in defining extensible GIS data exchange standards. The thesis argues that the sustainability of a distributed infrastructure also depends on successful organizational partnerships, scalable schemes for network management, as well as technical enhancements of GIS services in terms of data streaming techniques and effective compression standards for GIS data on the Internet. by Nadine S.

40|$|Nowadays, a {{trend of}} forming <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chains</b> with {{different}} trading partners over different e-marketplaces has emerged. These supply chains, which are called “supply mesh,” generally refer to heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which <b>dynamic</b> supply <b>chains,</b> as per project (often make-to-order), are formed across different parties.

To take the benefits of the proposed algorithms, we developed a simple heuristic that allows the system to find relatively good label order.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{available}} in English and Dutch  The theory of Chain-computerisation (Grijpink, 1997) was developed from practical insights and insights derived from the Organisation and Management Sciences. The theory focuses on large-scale information exchange in social chains {{and is based on}} three different components: a specific chain perspective, a chain analysis method and a specific type of information-infrastructure resulting from the application of the Chain-computerisation theory. In this article, we investigate the various similarities and differences between the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation and insights on Interorganisational Systems (IOS) in the disciplines of Management Science and Public Administration. Based on this, we will indicate where the disciplines augment each other. This article will conclude that the methodology of Chain-computerisation is more intricate than the methods that are proposed in the IOS literature. It is precisely through the weighted combination of four assessment profiles and its <b>dynamic</b> <b>chain</b> concept that the theory of Chain-computerisation enables a sharper analysis of the possibility to create a chain information system. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>chain</b> concept that is the core of the theory is a worthy complement to the manner in which chains are conceived in IOS and Public Administration. This conclusion does not necessarily apply to the Chain-computerisation assessment framework. These have been constructed for a specific purpose and cannot, therefore, be applied to a broader IOS context. Conversely, the Chain-computerisation theory can be augmented with a number of insights from administrative and organisational theory with respect to IOS. These are concerned with the role of regional ‘sub-chain formation’ within a national or international chain and the possibility of central coordination by a dominant party. Finally, IOS literature offers concrete opportunities for augmenting the chain co-operation profile, one of the assessment profiles of the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation...|$|R
