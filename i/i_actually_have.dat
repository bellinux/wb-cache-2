Lundgren plays Jack Caine, a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, {{who does not}} let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission {{to wipe out the}} White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while he was waylaid stopping a convenience store robbery. Lundgren said of his role, [...] "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get {{to do more than just}} action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act. One author said [...] "Universe (1987) or Dark Angel (1990), demonstrates that nature and his [...] hairdresser have suited him perfectly to Nazi genetically engineered baddie roles." ...|$|E

[...] Though he admired Hitchens generally {{as a writer and}} [...] "provocateur", Donohue has said that Hitchens was [...] "totally overrated as a scholar ... sloppy in his research". Donohue released a book to coincide with Saint Teresa's canonization, entitled [...] "Unmasking Mother Teresa's Critics". In an interview, Donohue said, [...] "Unlike Hitchens, who wrote a 98-page book with no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography, no attribution at all, just 98 pages of unsupported opinion, I have a short book too. But <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> more footnotes than I have pages in the book. That’s because I want people to check my sources." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2017, in an {{interview}} with XXL, when asked about collaborative albums, T.I. answered [...] "Man, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a few of them. Me and Jeezy, we were supposed been did this a while ago. The project was gonna be called, Dope Boy Academy, and we did like three or four songs, but we just gotta get back in and put it together. We just want to present it correctly. Also, me and [...] Dro was talking about doing one. I think we was gonna call it Sophisticated Excellence or something like that…something he came up with. Me and B.o.B was supposed to do one called The Man and the Martian. I’m open to all collaborations. Me and Trey Songz were supposed to do one too called The Lady Killers. All those of these projects could very well come into fruition." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Honora," [...] cried Susan, [...] "how {{energetic}} you are! <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a {{shock when}} I went {{to your room}} and found you'd gone. I'll have to write Miss Turner." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{having a}} veil {{to put down}} over my own face, I stooped {{and picked up the}} newspaper. Her devilish {{determination}} quite upset me for the moment. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to steady myself before I could speak to her again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{one thing}} is certain," [...] said Gilbert, laughing, [...] "'Observer' has made Uncle Abe's {{reputation}} as a weather prophet. 'Uncle Abe's storm' {{will go down in}} local history. It is a most extraordinary coincidence that it should have come on the very day we selected. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a half guilty feeling, as if I really had 'magicked' it up. We may as well rejoice over the old house being removed, for there's not much to rejoice over where our young trees are concerned. Not ten of them have escaped." ...|$|E
5000|$|Git's {{primitives}} are not inherently a source-code management system. Torvalds explains, In {{many ways}} you can just see git as a filesystem it's content-addressable, {{and it has a}} notion of versioning, but I really really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a filesystem person (hey, kernels is what I do), and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> absolutely zero interest in creating a traditional SCM system.|$|E
5000|$|I {{remember}} my parents sneaking me {{in to see}} Young Frankenstein. We would also watch Saturday Night Live, or Monty Python, or old Marx Brothers movies. My dad would let us stay up late to watch The Honeymooners. We {{were not allowed to}} watch The Flintstones though: my dad hated it because it ripped off The Honeymooners. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a very low level of Flintstones knowledge for someone my age.|$|E
2500|$|However, Girls Aloud member Sarah Harding rubbished {{reports of}} the feud, saying: [...] " [...] It {{was taken out of}} proportion, twisted and they [...] retaliated. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a drink with Natalie Appleton and Liam Gallagher the other week as we have a mutual friend– {{everything}} is fine, honestly." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the single release, the record company included it on the Choose Your Masques album, leaving Marion Lloyd-Langton to complain: [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> three tracks for the Masques album, but RCA insisted that Silver Machine went on, so the third track was dropped; pity about that." ...|$|R
2500|$|In their {{feature on}} Goldman, IGN said [...] "It's a {{testament}} to just how truly great William Goldman is at his best that <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to think hard about what to select as his 'Must-See' cinematic work". [...] The site described his script for All the President's Men as a [...] "model of storytelling clarity... and artful manipulation".|$|R
5000|$|With ongoing {{commitments}} now for movie trailers, network promo for ABC, Fox, CW, National Geographic, TLC, FX {{and a host}} {{of radio}} and television affiliates and a lot of commercial work, the days get a little tight from time to time. So much so, that he even has a unit that he can use to record from his car. [...] "Don't worry, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> to pull over", he says.|$|E
5000|$|Hennesy {{spoke about}} being {{approached}} {{to write the}} novel during an interview with Xfinity, [...] "About {{a year and a}} half ago Jill Farren Phelps approached me and said that all the higher up at ABC and the publishing house, Hyperion, and Disney and because of the Pandora series they knew that I was already a published author. So they’re the ones who actually approached me, would I like to write a fictionalized account of all the characters in Port Charles from Spinelli’s point of view. I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> the imagination to pitch the idea to them. They came to me and it took off from there." ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{once again}} {{produced}} {{themselves for the}} third album, Moth & Rust, released in 1999. According to the band, this record became more of a lyrical than musical an exploration. [...] "Previous CDs have been either therapy for the songwriter or fun lyrical meanderings. This... {{is the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a message toward the listener," [...] songwriter Stef Loy explained, [...] "Now I’m trying purposely to give the listener something to think about." [...] The albums' title and primary message were taken from Matthew 6:19-20. The album is themed on philosophical and spiritual points such as the decline of morality and absolutes, and hidden dangers in the American Dream.|$|E
5000|$|While on The Hollywood Reporter Director's Roundtable, Cianfrance {{said that}} he had given up his entire director's fee to help fund the film: [...] "I mean, it came down to we were exactly my fee short. They paid me and I just paid it back. So I still have to pay taxes on it, you know. So <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to pay to make the movie." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> no {{pitching}} {{experience and}} had never played organized baseball... I had practiced baseball with our school team all through high school, but of course, they would not let me play in the games. I was also the batgirl for our town team of men and practiced with them and went to all the games. I loved the game and had a strong arm, she recalled in her autobiography.|$|R
5000|$|Bryan {{maintains}} {{an interest in}} golf: [...] "I am a golfer. I don’t know if that’s “shocking”. I don’t get to play very often, but my parents just moved down to North Carolina on a golf course, so I golf while I’m down there. Every once in awhile in Brooklyn, I go out to Flatbush, to Reid Park. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a hole-in-one in Brooklyn two years ago. 182 yards, uphill, out at Dyker Beach Golf Club, 17th hole." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} write the script, Moverman {{consulted}} a wealth of books and articles in addition to speaking to people who knew Wilson in the 1960s and 1980s. He felt that Landy {{was the most difficult}} character to write for, as he says: [...] "even though many things that he Landy says in the movie <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> recording of, in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over the top." [...] Moverman has maintained that everything in the 1980s portions actually happened based on conversations he had had with Ledbetter, with a few exceptions being some topics of conversation spoken by the character Wilson in the film - they derived from Moverman's research but were unknown to have happened in real life.|$|E

5000|$|Stinson {{left the}} group in 2016, and commented on his departure, stating [...] "I left it in a good way. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to just start turning down tours because I was unable to tour; I got into a position, {{personal}}ly, where my personal life was going to prevent me from doing, I don’t know — {{it must have been}} about five tours that they called me to do, and I just said I can’t do ’em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is trying the {{ordinary}} Britisher a little high," [...] Nigel remarked, [...] "to ask him {{to believe that he}} was murdered in cold blood, here in the heart of London, by the secret service agent of a foreign Power. The strangest part of it all is that it is true. To think that those few pages of manuscript would have told us exactly what we have to fear! Why, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> them in my hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrus {{wrote in}} his memoir about such a need for {{compromise}} relative to his successful, last-ditch efforts in securing passage of the Alaska Lands Act during the last month of the Carter Administration in December 1980, following Ronald Reagan's election in November: [...] "The environmental groups were initially hostile. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> {{to listen to the}} idiotic argument (from the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club's paid Washington lobbyists) that they could get a better Alaska package out of Reagan and Watt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Batmangli's {{production}} blended contemporary recording techniques alongside previously established musical genres: [...] "There’s {{a lot of}} synth and sub-bass, and we have drums {{that almost}} sound intentionally programmed in parts. And that shooby doo wop is something that Rostam added in — it’s like taking old elements and making new sounds out of it." [...] The album's drum tracks were recorded by White Rabbits' Stephen Patterson in a separate studio. The use of saxophone on [...] "Rough Going (I Won't Let Up)" [...] {{was inspired by a}} dream Batmangli had ten years previously: [...] "I feel like when I was in college I was listening to The Walkmen a lot and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a memory of having a dream and in the dream I saw The Walkmen perform with saxes. ... So putting sax on the song, with Hamilton singing, was something I wanted to do for 10 years." ...|$|E

50|$|There was {{a really}} {{important}} customer there, a big Italian man, who shouted out to me, 'Sing Madame Butterfly,' {{and of course he}} didn't mean the whole opera. He meant that one very popular aria, 'un Bel Di'. So if I was to come back the next summer to earn more money during the next year I'd better know that aria. You know, and I didn't know anything about it; I just learned that one aria and a few others and then {{one thing led to another}} and I studied that, and I discovered that I could sing that, sort of, that way. But my first actual thing that I did was Candide for Leonard Bernstein's 50th birthday at Philharmonic Hall - at the time that's what it was called. And I don't know if that was an opera but it was very hard to sing. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> done 'Musetta' in La Bohème a long time ago in Washington DC. I mean, utterly terrifying. I mean basically I feel as though I was asked to do it and I did it.|$|E

3000|$|Now in retrospect, {{for many}} years <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> little energy and time {{to take care of}} my son, so it is {{impossible}} to give a second child.

5000|$|Speaking on the {{incident}} with five laps to go, Matt Kenseth - who finished 14th - said that Logano [...] "was {{a little bit}} tighter on that short run than I was and I couldn’t get away from him. All day we had him pretty good. I still thought I {{was going to be}} able to stay in front of him.

I won't talk to Joey. I don't have anything to talk to him about really. I mean, you make decisions every minute behind the wheel. To me, strategically, that doesn't seem like such a great decision for him. But that's how they wanted to win. ... I'm one of the only guys that hasn't been into it yet with Joey.

5000|$|Regarding his style, Nam Le {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "one of the demarcations is writers that deal primarily with language, the more lyrical minded writers, and writers that are more structurally oriented. I always used to...I started out writing poetry and reading poetry, and so I always knew that that was the side that I was most predisposed to, and so <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to be quite careful in these stories to not overdo that impulse, to not throw too many images or indulge too many lyrical flights of fancy." ...|$|R
