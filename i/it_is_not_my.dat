Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

Map was less favourably disposed toward Rhys, describing him as [...] "This king I have seen and know, and hate", but {{goes on to say}} [...] "I would not have my hatred blacken his worth; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> wish ever to suppress any man's excellence through envy".

500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales. In the first number, along with the promise to avoid the dullness of other periodicals, Fielding confronted [...] "the armies of Grub Street" [...] and proclaimed his disdain for the literary critics of the day: [...] "As to my brother authors, who, like mere mechanics, are envious and jealous of a rival in their trade, to silence their jealousies and fears, I declare that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention to encroach on the business now carried on by them, nor to deal {{in any of those}} wares which they at present vend to the public." [...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{carried the}} unusual credit of [...] "Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming" [...] and Faulks {{described}} how—using Fleming's article—he had employed the same style as Fleming {{did in his}} novels: [...] "it's standard journalistic: no semicolons, few adverbs, few adjectives, short sentences, a lot of verbs, a lot of concrete nouns. These are the tools, and that's literally the style." [...] Faulks also commented that [...] "some people find it perplexing but I think {{the way that the}} book has been presented... is a clever way of showing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> book, although, of course, it is my book." [...] A large part of Devil May Care is set in Persia (now Iran); it was an area Fleming had not previously dealt with in his Bond novels, describing it as [...] "full of thieves and crooks". Faulks said of his choice of location that Fleming [...] "didn't set any of his books there, which is surprising in some ways because Lebanon in the 60s would have made a great setting for a Bond story. But his loss is my gain.".|$|E
500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> opinion that you have ever been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E

2500|$|Not surprisingly, Muir's {{deep-seated}} {{feeling about}} nature as being his true home led to tension {{with his family}} {{at his home in}} Martinez, California.

2500|$|US {{television}} host Rachel Maddow ran {{a continuing}} segment on the bill, entitled [...] "Uganda Be Kidding Me" [...] on The Rachel Maddow Show. Maddow asserted that Cohen had [...] "blood on [...] hands" [...] for providing the false {{inspiration for the}} bill. She has also questioned the truth in Warren's statements when {{he said in an}} interview [...] "... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> political calling, as a pastor in America, to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations". Maddow highlighted his actions supporting Uganda's break with the Anglican Church for being [...] "pro-gay" [...] and asserted that Warren had contradicted his condemnation of its anti-homosexuality bill.|$|E

2500|$|On December 21, 2011, Barnes & Noble accidentally shipped 1500 {{copies of}} The Fault in Our Stars before the release date {{to people who}} had pre-ordered the book. Green {{released}} a statement saying, [...] "Mistakes happen. The people who made this error were not bad or incompetent people, {{and they were not}} acting maliciously. We all make mistakes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> wish to see Barnes and Noble or any of their employees vilified." [...] Many people who received the book pledged not to read it until its release date, January 10, 2012, or discuss it until the next day, January 11, as per a request of Green's not to spoil it for other readers. Most kept to this promise leaving the experience untarnished for those who got the book on the intended release date.|$|E
2500|$|I {{propose to}} create a heroic, monumental style of {{composition}} simple enough to inspire all people, completely free from fads, artificial mannerisms and false sophistications, direct, forceful, sincere, always original but never unnatural. [...] Music must be freed from decadence and stagnation. [...] There has been {{too much emphasis on}} small things while the great truths have been overlooked. The superficial must be dispensed with. [...] Music must become virile to express big things. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> purpose to supply a few pseudo-intellectual musicians and critics with more food for brilliant argumentation, but rather to inspire all mankind with new heroism and spiritual nobility. [...] This may appear to be sentimental and impossible to some, but it must be remembered that Palestrina, Handel and Beethoven would not consider it either sentimental or impossible. [...] In fact, the worthiest creative art has been motivated consciously or unconsciously by the desire for the regeneration of mankind.|$|E
2500|$|The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks {{appreciative of}} Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an {{interview}} with Norman Ross in Chicago, Callas said, [...] "I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice." [...] Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda {{in order to help}} her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas's recording. She then looked up at him and asked, [...] "Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?" [...] According to Time magazine, when Callas quit La Scala, [...] "Tebaldi made a surprising maneuver: she announced that she would not sing at La Scala without Callas. 'I sing only for artistic reasons; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> custom to sing against anybody', she said." ...|$|E

Grant to honor existing treaties and stem {{the flow of}} miners into their territories. [...] They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. [...] The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). [...] The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. [...] Spotted Tail said, [...] "You speak of another country, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> country; it does not concern me, and I {{want nothing to do}} with it. [...] I was not born there... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone."

2500|$|December 26: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paid a {{visit to}} Yasukuni Shrine and {{expressed}} his sincere condolences, paid his respects and prayed for the souls of all those who had fought for the country and made ultimate sacrifices. He also visited Chinreisha, a remembrance memorial to pray for the souls of all the people regardless of nationalities who lost their lives in the war, but not enshrined in the honden. The visit sparked admonition from the Chinese government, which called Abe's visits to Yasukuni [...] "an effort to glorify the Japanese militaristic history of external invasion and colonial rule... and to challenge the outcome of World War II," [...] as well as regret from Russia. The United States urged Japan to improve relations with neighbors after Yasukuni controversy. In an official statement, Abe explained that he wished to [...] "report before the souls of the war dead how my administration has worked for one year and to renew the pledge that Japan must never wage a war again. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The party began a reappraisal of {{the policy}} of {{abstention}} from the Dáil. At the 1983 Ard Fheis the constitution was amended to remove the ban on the discussion of abstentionism to allow Sinn Féin to run a candidate in the forthcoming European elections. However, in his address Adams said, [...] "We are an abstentionist party. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention to advocate change in this situation." [...] A motion to permit entry into the Dáil was allowed at the 1985 Ard Fheis, but without the active support of the leadership, and Adams did not speak. The motion failed narrowly. By October of the following year an IRA Convention had indicated its support for elected Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála (TDs) taking their seats. Thus, when the motion to end abstention was put to the Ard Fheis on 1 November 1986, {{it was clear that}} there would not be a split in the IRA as there had been in 1970. The motion was passed with a two-thirds majority. Ó Brádaigh and about twenty other delegates walked out, and met in a Dublin hotel with hundreds of supporters to re-organise as Republican Sinn Féin.|$|E

2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E
2500|$|In 234, Zhuge Ke was {{appointed}} as the Administrator (太守) of Danyang (丹楊) {{and was sent}} to suppress a revolt by the Shanyue tribes. Sun Quan appointed Chen Biao as the Commandant (都尉) of Xin'an (新安) and ordered him to be Zhuge Ke's advisor. Earlier on, Sun Quan had granted 200 taxable households to Chen Biao's family in recognition of Chen Wu's contributions, and those families were all based in Xin'an. Chen Biao saw that the men from those households were able-bodied and capable of serving in the military, so he requested permission from Sun Quan to recruit those men. Sun Quan asked him, [...] "Your late father rendered meritorious service to the state, and the state has granted your family these taxable households to honour his contributions. Why do you not want them?" [...] Chen Biao replied, [...] "I pledged to eliminate all the enemies {{of the state and}} avenge my father. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> wish to have these men – who are capable of military service – as my slaves." [...] He insisted on recruiting those men so Sun Quan agreed and praised him. Sun Quan then selected some households from other areas to replace those in Chen Biao's marquisate who had been conscripted.|$|E
