25|$|On 10 July 1944, a rifle section {{commanded}} by Naik Yeshwant Ghadge came under heavy machine-gun fire {{at close range}} which killed or wounded {{all members of the}} section except the commander. Without hesitation Naik Yeshwant Ghadge rushed the machine-gun position, <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> a grenade which knocked out the machine-gun and firer and then he shot one of the gun crew. Finally, having no time to change his magazine, he clubbed to death the two remaining members of the crew. He fell mortally wounded, shot by an enemy sniper.|$|E

The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the match}} against Victoria, {{he made his}} <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> call against a bowler at {{first-class}} level. During the match, Egar no-balled South Australian fast bowler Brian Quigley twice {{on the first day}} as Victoria batted first. He did so from the bowler's end as Quigley was trying to extract extra pace from the slow pitch. As the calls were made from the bowler's end, almost all of the spectators thought it was for Quigley overstepping the bowling mark, the most common mode of infringement; the fact that Egar made called the bowler for throwing only became apparent to most in the newspapers the next day. Quigley changed his action, but his results thereafter were not enough to gain selection.|$|E

500|$|On 5September 1887, {{a letter}} was {{published}} in The Times from Watts, proposing a scheme to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Entitled [...] "Another Jubilee Suggestion", Watts proposed to [...] "collect a complete record of the stories of heroism in every-day life". Watts cited the case of Alice Ayres, a servant who, trapped in a burning house, gave up the chance to jump to safety, instead <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> a mattress {{out of the window}} to cushion the fall, before running back into the house three times to fetch her employer's children and throwing them out of a window onto the mattress to safety before herself being overcome by fumes and falling out of the window to her death.|$|E

6000|$|A {{multitude}} of fierce passions were struggling in the tawny countenance of the Indian. For a moment inextinguishable hatred {{seemed to hold}} the mastery, and then a nobler expression, and one that better became {{the character of a}} brave, got possession of his features, and maintained itself until, <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> aside his light robe of pictured deer-skin, and pointing to the scar of a bayonet in his breast, he replied-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Patusan is {{a remote}} {{district}} of a native-ruled state, {{and the chief}} settlement bears the same name. At a point on the river about forty miles from the sea, where the first houses come into view, there can be seen rising above {{the level of the}} forests the summits of two steep hills very close together, and separated by what looks like a deep fissure, the cleavage of some mighty stroke. As a matter of fact, the valley between is nothing but a narrow ravine; the appearance from the settlement is of one irregularly conical hill split in two, and with the two halves leaning slightly apart. On the third day after the full, the moon, as seen from the open space in front of Jim's house (he had a very fine house in the native style when I visited him), rose exactly behind these hills, its diffused light at <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> the two masses into intensely black relief, and then the nearly perfect disc, glowing ruddily, appeared, gliding upwards between the sides of the chasm, till it floated away above the summits, as if escaping from a yawning grave in gentle triumph. [...] "Wonderful effect," [...] said Jim by my side. [...] "Worth seeing. Is it not?" ...|$|E
50|$|Toss a coin {{to decide}} which team starts. The <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> team will always throw all their balls first. The balls will be left on the arena until the {{opposing}} team has thrown all their balls. If you choose to play more than one round, then both teams will take turns on being the <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> team every other round. You need only to toss a coin before playing the first round.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1930, O’Callaghan {{took part in a}} two-day {{invitation}} event in Stockholm where Oissian Skoeld was expected to gain revenge on the Irishman for the defeat in Amsterdam.

On the second day of the event both O’Callaghan and Skoeld were neck-and-neck, when the former, with his last throw, set a new European record of 178’ 8” to win.|$|R
50|$|Ralph Rose, {{the two-time}} {{defending}} Olympic champion and holder of the Olympic record (14.81 metres, {{set at the}} 1904 Summer Olympics), was unseated by Pat McDonald after a colossal throw in the final.

50|$|When {{you throw}} the balls, they often hit other balls on the arena. You’re allowed {{to hit the}} balls {{in and out of}} the triangles (even if it means {{achieving}} or losing battle position). This is why it’s so important not to remove any balls from the arena until the joust is completed, that is to say, when both teams have thrown all their balls. Note that the only exception is when the <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> team knocks down the Lady before the knights (as described above). When that happens, their balls are removed immediately from the arena. The other team can then complete the joust. After that the <b>first</b> <b>throwing</b> team, as always, starts the next joust.|$|E

Pars last throw was his best, but 81.18 was not quite enough to catch Murofushi.|$|R
