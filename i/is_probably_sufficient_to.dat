As {{to the treatment of}} such illegal immigrants, when they are discovered, it should be the rule that they are at once returned to the country whence they came. The rule may possibly work harshly in individual cases, but unless it is understood that detection is invariably followed by expulsion the practice will not cease. It is probable that it will cease entirely as soon as it is discovered that the rule is actually in force.The case of the ´pseudo-traveller´ who comes in with a permission for a limited time and continues in Palestine after the term of his permission has expired is more difficult. Where the case is flagrant, recourse should certainly be had to expulsion. In case of no special flagrancy, and where there is no special objection to the individual, it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> maintain the present practice, under which he is counted against the Labor Schedule, though this method does a certain injustice to the Jewish immigrant outside the country, whose place is taken by the traveller concerned." ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{recently}} developed highly specific antisera {{to the full}} range of known adult mammalian skeletal muscle myosins, an immunohistochemical and histochemical examination was made of the middle ear muscle tensor tympani in the dog and cat. Approximately half the fibres were of the IIM type and there was a substantial population of apparently slow-tonic fibres, both these types being rare in mammals. In addition, some type I but no IIA nor IIB fibres were detected. Moreover, as no multiple end-plate innervation, thought to be typical of slow-tonic fibres, could be demonstrated in this muscle by acetylcholinesterase staining or by Ruffini gold impregnation, it is suggested that in tensor tympani the slow-tonic fibres are focally innervated.

It appears on the basis of the results of the reported investigation that carbon can be an effective reducing agent during reheating events such as those encountered by lunar soils and breccias. Phosphate reduction may be viewed as a two-step process in which carbon is mobilized as CO during heating and preferentially dissolved in the metal phase. It then acts as a reducing agent on cooling. Gas phase transport and diffusion of carbon in metal are sufficiently rapid to allow uniform carbon distribution both within and between metal grains.

Beyond this range of strain, the mantle was much stiffer, in both the circumferential direction, 0. 542 +/- 0. 025 MPa (mean +/- s. e. m., N= 51) and through the thickness of the mantle wall, 0. 152 +/- 0. 041 MPa (N= 11). Almost 80 % of the work done on the tissue during compression in the circumferential direction was recovered during elastic recoil of the tissue; this elastic work could contribute to refilling the mantle after a jet.

Cholesterol efflux to HDL and exogenously added apoA-I decreased in the absence of apoA-I. Phospholipid and cholesterol lipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I was reduced in the absence of caveolin- 1.

The binding of the C 4 B isotype, and most likely C 3, to hydroxyl nucleophiles, however, involves a histidine residue, which attacks the thioester to form an intramolecular acyl-imidazole bond. The released thiolate anion then acts as a base to catalyze the binding of hydroxyl nucleophiles, including water, to the acyl function. This mechanism allows the complement proteins to bind to the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates found on all biological surfaces, including the components of bacterial cell walls.
