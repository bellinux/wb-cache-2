5|$|Hinduism is {{the major}} {{religion}} with about 80% of the population adhering to it. About 11% of the population follow Islam and 8% follow Christianity. Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka. Hinduism, often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, traces its roots to prehistoric times in India. The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called Jonaka Mappila. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala's Jewish settlements. Kerala {{is also home to}} one of the oldest Jewish communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.|$|E

25|$|Although Lanying was sorrowful {{about her}} father’s death, she began {{working at the}} age of 60 after the Culture Revolution. She found that the {{dislocation}} density of existing gallium arsenide was very large due to gravity and not good enough to use, so she decided to make the experiment in artificial satellites. This was a dangerous experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the first person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> had made this experiment successfully. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the government in China named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: 中科稼英) after her in 2001. This company has been in business for over than 10 years.|$|E
25|$|MINURSO is {{the only}} UN {{peacekeeping}} mission established since 1978 to be operating without the capacity to monitor human rights. Although Resolution 1979 of the UN Security Council recommends the establishment of one, this has not yet happened. In 1995, MINURSO's inability or unwillingness to act against perceived Moroccan manipulation of the process, and abuse of Sahrawi civilians, caused its former deputy chairman Frank Ruddy to deliver a strong attack on the organization; he has since kept up his critique of what he argues is an economically costly and politically corrupt process. Growing criticism has been voiced against the UN Security Council for not establishing a program of human rights (as MINURSO {{is the only}} UN mission <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> has no mandate on them) monitoring for Western Sahara and the Sahrawi population, despite serious reports of numerous abuses.|$|E

25|$|He hits many sixes {{long and}} high, favouring {{straight}} down the ground or over midwicket. His trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and {{he is one of}} the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 7,000 ODI runs at an average under 25. Afridi is the only player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> has scored 1,000 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 format of the game. Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, he prefers to open the batting; however, elsewhere he prefers to bat at number six.|$|E
25|$|Some see spam-blocking tools as {{a threat}} to free expression—and laws against {{spamming}} as an untoward precedent for regulation or taxation of e-mail and the Internet at large. Even though it is possible in some jurisdictions to treat some spam as unlawful merely by applying existing laws against trespass and conversion, some laws specifically targeting spam have been proposed. In 2004, United States passed the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 that provided ISPs with tools to combat spam. This act allowed Yahoo! to successfully sue Eric Head, reportedly one of the biggest spammers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> <b>who</b> settled the lawsuit for several thousand U.S. dollars in June 2004. But the law is criticized by many for not being effective enough. Indeed, the law was supported by some spammers and organizations that support spamming, and opposed by many in the anti-spam community. Examples of effective anti-abuse laws that respect free speech rights include those in the U.S. against unsolicited faxes and phone calls, and those in Australia and a few U.S. states against spam.|$|E
