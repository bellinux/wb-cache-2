Laforin is a protein mutated in patients with Lafora disease. EPM 2 A codes for the protein laforin, a dual-specificity phosphatase with a carbohydrate binding domain (CBM- 20). In order to inhibit the dual specificity action of laforin protein we perform <b>docking</b> <b>analysis</b> by using phytochemicals from the medicinal plant Valeriana officinalis.

Sample sizes of 10 - 100 {{statistically}} independent objects (rejects from processes or loading <b>dock</b> <b>analysis,</b> or patients with a rare disease), each with hundreds of data points, cause unstable models with poor predictive quality.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, several Grid {{computing}} centres chose virtualization as {{a better way}} to manage diverse use cases with self-consistent environments on the same bare infrastructure. The maturity of control interfaces (such as OpenNebula and OpenStack) opened the possibility to easily change the amount of resources assigned to each use case by simply turning on and off virtual machines. Some of those private clouds use, in production, copies of the Virtual Analysis Facility, a fully virtualized and self-contained batch analysis cluster capable of expanding and shrinking automatically upon need: however, resources starvation occurs frequently as expansion has to compete with other virtual machines running long-living batch jobs. Such batch nodes cannot relinquish their resources in a timely fashion: the more jobs they run, the longer it takes to drain them and shut off, and making one-job virtual machines introduces a non-negligible virtualization overhead. By improving several components of the Virtual Analysis Facility we have realized an experimental “Docked” Analysis Facility for ALICE, which leverages containers instead of virtual machines for providing performance and security isolation. We will present the techniques we have used to address practical problems, such as software provisioning through CVMFS, as well as our considerations on the maturity of containers for High Performance Computing. As the abstraction layer is thinner, our <b>Docked</b> <b>Analysis</b> Facilities may feature a more fine-grained sizing, down to single-job node containers: we will show how this approach will positively impact automatic cluster resizing by deploying lightweight pilot containers instead of replacing central queue polls...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} the structural bases for the amino acid selectivity of the Thermus thermophilus leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRSTT) aminoacylation site and {{to disclose the}} binding pattern of pre-transfer editing substrates. Methods. Eight amino acids proposed as semi-cognate substrates for aminoacylation and eight aminoacyl-adenylates (formed from AMP and eight amino acids) were prepared in zwitterions form. The protein structure with a co-crystallized substrate in the aminoacylation site [PDBID: 1 OBH] was taken from RCSB. Docking settings and evaluation of substrate efficiency were followed by twofold <b>docking</b> function <b>analysis</b> for each conformation with Gold CCDC. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed using Gromacs. The procedures of relaxation and binding study were separated in two different subsequent simulations for 50 ns and 5 ns. Results. The evaluation of substrate efficiency for 8 amino acids by twofold <b>docking</b> function <b>analysis,</b> based on score values,has shown that the ligands of LeuRSTT can be positioned in the following order: Leu>Nva>Hcy>Nle>Met>Cys>Ile >Val. MD simulation has revealed lower electrostatic interactions of isoleucine with the active site of the enzyme compared with those for norvaline and leucine. In the case of aminoacyl-adenylates {{no significant differences were}} found based on score values for both GoldScore and Asp functions. Molecular dynamics of leucyl-, isoleucyl- and norvalyl-adenylates showed that the most stable and conformationally favorable is leucine, then follow norvaline and isoleucine. It has been also found that the TYR 43 of the active site covers carboxyl group of leucine and norvaline like a shield and deflected towards isoleucine, allowing water molecules to come closer. Conclusions. In this study we revealed some structural basis for screening unfavorable substrates by shape, size and flexibility of a radical. The results obtained for different amino acids by molecular docking and MD studies well correlate with the experimental data on the first stage of aminoacylation. MD study of the aminoacyl-adenylates revealed that difficulty of some amino acids activation can be caused by two reasons: excessive flexibility due to the size or structure and quick hydrolysis of intermediate substrate with nucleophilic attack by water molecules. ...|$|R

Many of the computational problems faced by the bio-sciences can be naturally formalized in constraint-systems over finite domains or reals. The contributions to the WCB series of workshop of the last years, starting from 2005, provide an excel-lent overview over recent approaches for tackling bioinformatics problems using constraint methodology. Constraint techniques proved to be successful {{for a variety of}} problems. Some of the discussed topics were sequence analysis, biological systems simulations, protein structure prediction and <b>docking,</b> pedigree <b>analysis,</b> haplotype inference, and many others. This year, we could select 7 strong workshop contributions out of 8 submissions. The discussed topics will comprise the application of constraint-based methods to SNP selec-tion, biosystems simulation, hidden markov models, haplotype inference, and protein struc-ture prediction. The variety of topics and the continuing high interest in the workshop em-phasize once more that constraint-based methods are a very valuable tool for bioinformatics and promise significant advance in a broad application range...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis is {{essential}} for plant productivity and critical for plant growth. More than 90 % of plants have a C 3 metabolic pathway primarily for carbon assimilation. Improving crop yields for food and fuel is a major challenge for plant biology. To enhance the production of wheat there is need to adopt the strategies that can create the change in plants at the molecular level. During the study we have employed computational bioinformatics and interactomics analysis of C 3 metabolic pathway proteins in wheat. The three-dimensional protein modeling provided insight into molecular mechanism and enhanced understanding of physiological processes and biological systems. Therefore in our study, initially we constructed models for nine proteins involving C 3 metabolic pathway, as these are not determined through wet lab experiment (NMR, X-ray Crystallography) and not available in RCSB Protein Data Bank and UniProt KB. On the basis of <b>docking</b> interaction <b>analysis,</b> we proposed the schematic diagram of C 3 metabolic pathway. Accordingly, there also exist vice versa interactions between 3 PGK and Rbcl. Future site and directed mutagenesis experiments in C 3 plants could be designed {{on the basis of}} our findings to confirm the predicted protein interactions...|$|R
