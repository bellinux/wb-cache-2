25|$|When nothing works, Amara {{claims that}} God must appear Himself {{to see her}} {{destroying}} everything He created and loves. Then, she decides to draw out God by torturing an archangel, making Lucifer/Castiel scream in agony. Meanwhile, Chuck returns and reveals himself to Metatron, telling him He is God.
