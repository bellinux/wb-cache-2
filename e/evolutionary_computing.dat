25|$|The {{theory of}} more {{sophisticated}} mean field type particle Monte Carlo methods had certainly {{started by the}} mid-1960s, {{with the work of}} Henry P. McKean Jr. on Markov interpretations of a class of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics. We also quote an earlier pioneering article by Theodore E. Harris and Herman Kahn, published in 1951, using mean field genetic-type Monte Carlo methods for estimating particle transmission energies. Mean field genetic type Monte Carlo methodologies are also used as heuristic natural search algorithms (a.k.a. Metaheuristic) in <b>evolutionary</b> <b>computing.</b> The origins of these mean field computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the work of Alan Turing on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines and the articles by Nils Aall Barricelli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|The variable-opt {{method is}} related to, and a {{generalization}} of the k-opt method. Whereas the k-opt methods remove a fixed number (k) of edges {{from the original}} tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix {{the size of the}} edge set to remove. Instead they grow the set as the search process continues. The best known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>computing.</b> The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives results that are guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what {{has been described as a}} mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnecting the tour in a different way, then V-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. V-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem that}} arises {{in the area}} of grid computing is one of optimally assigning jobs to resources to achieve a business objective. In the grid computing area, however, such scheduling has mostly been done from the perspective of maximizing the utilization of resources. As this form of computing proliferates, the business aspects will become crucial for the overall success of the technology. Hence, we discuss the grid scheduling problem from a business perspective. We show that this problem is not only strongly NP-hard, but it is also non-approximable. Therefore, we propose heuristics for different variants of the problem and show that these heuristics provide near-optimal solution {{for a wide variety of}} problem instances. We show that the execution times of proposed heuristics are very low, and hence, they are suitable for solving problems in real-time. We also present several managerial implications and compare the performance of two widely used models in the real-time scheduling of grid <b>computing.</b> <b>Evolutionary</b> computations Parallel <b>computing</b> Scheduling Heuristic Integer programming...|$|R
