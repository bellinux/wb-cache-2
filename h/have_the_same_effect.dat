5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E

5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> on limiting proliferation.|$|E
