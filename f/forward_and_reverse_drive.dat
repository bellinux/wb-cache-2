5000|$|Secondary {{breakdown}} is {{a failure}} mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads {{to the destruction of}} the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> base <b>drive.</b> Except at low collector-emitter voltages, the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device. Power MOSFETs do not exhibit secondary breakdown, and their safe operating area is limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the bonding wires), maximum power dissipation and maximum voltage. [...] However, Power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling Secondary Breakdown.|$|R

30|$|An ample {{amount of}} work has also been done to create a reverse mapping model between the process {{parameters}} and the performance indicators. Parappagoudar et al.

Parappagoudar et al.

Amarnath and Pratihar (2009) used radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) for <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> input–output mapping of the tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding process. In their proposed methodology, the structure and the parameters of the RBFNN were modified using a combination of GA and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm for both the <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> mapping. Chandrashekarappa et al. (2014) used BPNN <b>and</b> GA-NN for <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> mappings of the squeeze casting process. Kittur and Parappagoudar (2012) utilized BPNN <b>and</b> GA-NN for <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> mapping in the die casting process. Because batch training requires a tremendous amount of data, they used previously generated equations to supplement the experimental data. Malakooti and Raman (2000) used ANN to create forward- and backward-direction mappings between the process outputs and inputs for the cutting operation on a lathe.|$|R
