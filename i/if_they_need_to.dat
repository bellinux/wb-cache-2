If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

25|$|Altar servers, {{regardless}} of age, {{are subject to}} all the normal restrictions for those not of higher clerical position. Anyone who is bleeding, or has an open sore, is not permitted to enter the altar. They may not touch the altar table or anything on it under any circumstances, nor the prothesis without a blessing. They may not touch the sacred vessels, the chalice and diskos (paten) at any time. They may not stand {{directly in front of}} the altar table or pass between the front of it and the iconostasis, but must cross between the altar and the High Place <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> move to the opposite side.|$|E
25|$|Optimization {{can occur}} {{at a number}} of levels. Typically the higher levels have greater impact, and are harder to change later on in a project, {{requiring}} significant changes or a complete rewrite <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be changed. Thus optimization can typically proceed via refinement from higher to lower, with initial gains being larger and achieved with less work, and later gains being smaller and requiring more work. However, in some cases overall performance depends on performance of very low-level portions of a program, and small changes at a late stage or early consideration of low-level details can have outsized impact. Typically some consideration is given to efficiency throughout a project – though this varies significantly – but major optimization is often considered a refinement to be done late, if ever. On longer-running projects there are typically cycles of optimization, where improving one area reveals limitations in another, and these are typically curtailed when performance is acceptable or gains become too small or costly.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, {{and it seemed to}} have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> chop it down into a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E
2500|$|Although Old Irish {{has both}} a sound [...] {{and a letter}} h, there is no {{consistent}} relationship between the two.

On the other hand, words that begin with the sound [...] are usually written without it: [...] "her gold". If the sound and the spelling co-occur, it is by coincidence, as [...] "it is not".|$|E

Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E

But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women {{to be able to have}} an abortion <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> protect their health.

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of divisional structure {{is that it}} uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. [...] Another {{advantage of}} using divisional structure {{is that it is}} more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar function and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{government}} claimed [...] that S.A.S {{could not}} be considered a victim within in the meaning of the Convention's Article 34 which says any persons who claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention can put forward an application to the Court. They questioned how important the full veil was for her religious practice, given that she only wore the veil at certain occasions and not at other, and underlined that she had never been stopped by the police. S.A.S argued that she was a potential victim as a devout Muslim and said the possibility of wearing a full veil was important to her. The court stated that while protection after Article 9 on religious freedom required a certain level of seriousness and cohesion, a state could not overrule which religious practices a person considered important; and underlined that a manifestation of religion [...] didn't need to be mandatory within a religion to be protected. The court further expressed that a person can be considered a victim <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> modify their behaviour to avoid risk of prosecution, or belonged to a group that risks being directly affected by the law, and found this applied to S.A.S. Her claim of being a victim [...] was therefore accepted by the court.|$|E

50|$|At {{that time}} it was only about 500 metres from the coast and {{therefore}} close to Frisia's maritime trading routes including the route between Dorestad and Haithabu.

60|$|I {{tell this}} little story at some length, as an {{instance}} of what these islands have cost us in blood and treasure. I have heard it regretted that we restored Martinique to the French, and kept St. Lucia instead. But in so doing, the British Government acted {{at least on the}} advice which Rodney had given as early as the year 1778. St. Lucia, he held, would render Martinique and the other islands of little use in war, owing to its windward situation and its good harbours; for from St. Lucia every other British island might receive speedy succour. He advised that the Little Carenage should be made a permanent naval station, with dockyard and fortifications, and a town built there by Government, which would, in his opinion, have become a metropolis for the other islands. And indeed, Nature had done her part to make such a project easy of accomplishment. But Rodney's advice was not taken--any more than his advice to people the island, by having a considerable quantity of land in each parish allotted to ten-acre men (i.e. white yeomen), under penalty of forfeiting it to the Crown should it be ever converted to any other use than provision ground (i.e. thrown into sugar estates). This advice shows that Rodney's genius, though, with the prejudices of his time, he supported not only slavery, but the slave-trade itself, had perceived one of the most fatal weaknesses of the slave-holding and sugar-growing system. And well it would have been for St. Lucia if his advice had been taken. But neither ten-acre men nor dockyards were ever established in St. Lucia. The mail-steamers, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go into dock, have, I am ashamed to say, to go to Martinique, where the French manage matters better. The admirable Carenage harbour is empty; Castries remains a little town, small, dirty, dilapidated, and unwholesome; and St. Lucia itself is hardly to be called a colony, but rather the nucleus of a colony, which may become hereafter, by energy and good government, a rich and thickly-peopled garden up to the very mountain-tops.|$|E
