Academic adviser: Associate professor Stefan Höjelid Author: Magnus Nordahl This study focuses on the increased role of the European Court of Justice through {{the establishment of a}} Constitution for Europe {{and its impact on the}} balance <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> both horizontal and vertical. To do this, the study takes its aims from the research problem, formulated as follows: Does the establishment of a constitution for Europe contribute to an increased role for the European Court of Justice and does it create a more legible horizontal and vertical <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power?</b> To reach the relevant analyses and conclusions two precise questions are presented as well as an analytical model. The precise questions are: • Which are the relevant contributions for the balance <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from a perspective of juridification in the new EU-treaty? • What impacts do those contributions have on the so called ‘European federalism’? The theoretical perspective of this study is rooted in the concept of federalism with special emphasizes on constitution and sovereignty as well as a part about the process of juridification. Along with the presented analytical model consisting of a horizontal and vertical <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> the empirical material is presented with focus on the new EU-treaty about a constitution for Europe and the European Court of Justice. By doing this, analyses are made about the changing <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the ECJ and the new EU-treaty from a perspective <b>of</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> federalism and juridification. Through the establishment of the EU-treaty about the creation of a constitution the ECJ receive a clearer platform to act upon which contributes to a more legible <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> both horizontal and vertical. This due to the fact that the new EU-treaty will take place as the highest law within the EU, something that the ECJ have the right to interpret. The whole process is also a broader recognition of the process of juridification where judicial power increases on the cost of politics.

He {{is the only}} Indiana {{governor}} elected to two non-consecutive terms, and the only governor between 1852 and 1977 to be elected {{to more than one}} term in office. His terms were marked by strong opposition party control of the Indiana General Assembly, which attempted to remove powers from the governor that had been granted during the Great Depression. Schricker fought the attempt in the state courts, and although his power was significantly reduced, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tucker v. Indiana that the governor was {{the chief executive of the}} state, and the legislature could not pass legislation that interfered with the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E

The arrangement would effectively give the Assembly the ability to manage the departments. Schricker vetoed the bill when it reached his desk, but his veto was again overridden.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the transformation of}} centre-regional relationships in post-Soviet Russia, focusing on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between federal and regional authorities and bilateral treaties. The Federal Treaty of 1992, the new Federal Constitution of 1993 and bilateral treaties signed between 1994 and 1998 provide for the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in Russia. In some cases, these treaties were annulled by mutual agreement between 2001 and 2003, but other regions resisted their elimination, and regions such as the Republic of Tatarstan started to negotiate new treaties. These treaties led centre-regional relationships in the Russian Federation to very individual problems. Thus, {{in order to understand}} centre-regional relationships, each treaty and each case of the opposition needs to be examined separately: the conflict between Russia and Chechnya, the competition over sovereignty between the federal government and both Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, as well as negotiations between Moscow and other regions. On the other hand, it is also useful to deal with this issue comprehensively. During {{the second half of the}} 1990 s, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned about the vulnerability of federalism in Russia and stressed the need for reform, including amendment of the Constitution and the abolition of bilateral treaties. He was unable to achieve these goals, but did draw attention to the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> as a federal issue. Some laws concerning centre-regional relationships were adopted, and one of the most important laws, the 1999 fundamental law on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between the centre and regions provided a comprehensive rule for individual centre-regional relationships. The bilateral treaties were gradually eliminated under the first presidency of Vladimir Putin in the process of his aggressive implementation of federal reforms. These reforms are commonly criticized as a symbol of an undemocratic or authoritarian regime. However, there are two important facts that cannot be explained through such assessments. First, few of the regional subjects of the Russian Federation criticized or opposed the elimination of the treaties, and some regional leaders even co-operated in their abolition. Second, this process is a continual reform <b>of</b> the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> which had already started in the late 1990 s. In this paper, first, I describe the content of the bilateral treaties in order to determine what role they played in the relationships between the centre and regions. I next analyze the process of enactment of the new federal law on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between the federal centre and regions. Up to this point, centre-regional relationships in Russia had varied widely because of the bilateral treaties. Both the federal government and the regional governments realized the necessity for a united judicial framework and actively took part in the discussion on the new law through the Council of Federation, the Upper House of the Federal Assembly in Russian Federation. Following the political process in the late 1990 s, the new Russian government under Putin implemented federal reforms, including abolishment of bilateral treaties. I thus analyze the process of abolishment of the treaties, the legislative process and the contents of the amendments on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between the centre and regions. Finally, I try to explain why the regional authorities agreed to renounce the bilateral treaties, and how the relationships between the federal government and regional governments have changed in Russia...|$|R
