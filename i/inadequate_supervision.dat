Convicted on similar charges, Tidwell was removed from office and sentenced to 120 days in jail, ten years of probation and a $6,000 fine. Tidwell's trial publicly uncovered a 2004 guilty plea he entered after being charged with soliciting a prostitute.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the effects on asphalt mixes of <b>inadequate</b> field <b>supervision</b> over filler content and compaction. Inadequate field control frequently leads to asphalt mixes with more fines in the mix production stage and less compaction than is desirable. An extensive laboratory program was executed in which these effects were studied. Varying the levels of compactive effort and filler content produced appreciable effects on the properties of asphalt mixes, but the effects were not consistent with the degree of variance. Voids are affected more by changes in the filler content than by compactive effort. The variation of modulus of resilience with changes in void content was established and suggests a definite relationship. Finally, a rational mix design procedure is suggested based on the results of the laboratory analysis...|$|R
40|$|Project cost {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} criteria of success of project and is of high concern to those who are involved in the construction industry. However, studies show that rarely projects are complete within stipulated budget. This study is focusing on identification of significant causes affecting construction cost in MARA large projects. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among the personnel of Project Management Consultant (PMC). Data was analyzed with statistical tools to determine the rank of factors affecting construction cost. It is concluded that cash flow and financial difficulties faced by contractors, contractor's poor site management and <b>supervision,</b> <b>inadequate</b> contractor experience, shortage of site workers, incorrect planning and scheduling by contractors are most severe factors while changes in scope of project and frequent design changes are least affecting factors on construction cost. Spearman correlation analysis showed that incorrect planning and scheduling by contractor has strong positive relationship with contractor’s poor site management and <b>supervision,</b> <b>inadequate</b> experience of contractors has strong positive relationship with incorrect planning and scheduling; and contractor’s poor site management and supervision, changes in scope of project has strong positive relationship with frequent design changes; and vice versa. </p...|$|R

Hardly any empirical research, however, integrates both long-term and short-term risk factors. We formulated hypotheses derived from the Integrated Cognitive Antisocial Potential theory (Farrington 2005) with regard to long-term and short-term risk factors for serious delinquency, and tested these hypotheses using data from the WODC Youth Delinquency Survey (data sweep 2005) of 292 juvenile delinquents. The findings indicate that serious delinquency is related not only to (an accumulation of) long-term risk factors, but also to situational factors, such as lack of tangible guardians and having used substances (alcohol or drugs) prior to the offence...|$|R

40|$|An {{endogenous}} growth model with financial intermediation {{is used to}} show how government policies towards the financial sector can lead to banking crises and persistent growth slumps. The model shows how government deposit guarantees and regulatory forbearance can lead to permanent declines in {{the growth rate of}} the economy. The effects of <b>inadequate</b> prudential <b>supervision</b> on asset price dynamics under perfect foresight are also derived in the model. The policies that are used in the analysis are based on essential features of Japanese financial regulation. The implications of the model are compared to the experience of the Japanese economy and financial system during the 1990 s. We find that the dynamics predicted by our model are generally consistent with the recent behavior of economic aggregates, asset prices and the banking system for Japan. A policy implication of the model is that the impact on future economic growth depends upon the length of time the government fails to enforce loan-loss reserving by banks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold. The first was the {{development}} of environmental education field trip guides to areas in Cache Valley for teachers in grades three through six that would provide learning activities that cannot be structured in the classroom. Six field trip guides to areas of Cache Valley with accompanying activities and discussion questions were constructed. The guides were tested in the field by three groups of teachers and students and teachers not participating in the field test evaluated the guides for difficulties they would encounter in using the guides. The second study purpose was to determine constraints faced by Cache Valley elementary teachers in using such guides and conducting environmental education programs. This was accomplished by the use of a questionnaire which was given to elementary teachers in Logan City. Although a lack of environmental education guides and materials was apparent, major constraints listed were a lack of transportation and funds and <b>inadequate</b> student <b>supervision...</b>|$|R
