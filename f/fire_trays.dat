40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of firing positions on the bonding strength of metal ceramic restorations. For this purpose a series of six SCHWICKERATH discs was prepared on the honeycomb <b>firing</b> <b>tray</b> {{and a series of}} six SCHWICKERATH discs on the ceramic <b>firing</b> <b>tray</b> in three different ceramic furnaces (Vacumat® 300, Programat® P 90, Vario Press® 300). The series was labelled according to position (rear, right, front, left, middle) : rear series, right series, front series, left series, middle 1 series, middle 2 series. A series, therefore, consisted of six test specimens whereby each of them underwent the separate firing processes in the same firing positions. This was achieved by appropriately labelling the test specimens so that any confusion was eliminated. In addition, two series in position middle 1 in the furnace Programat® P 90 were prepared which, unlike all the other series, were not fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions, but fired with + 20 °C or - 20 °C respectively, from all of the firings according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. The bond strength was tested using the SCHWICKERATH-test which is defined in DIN EN ISO 9693 [DIN, 2000] and is established as a suitable method of determining the bond strength in the German speaking world [DÖRFLER et al., 1995]. All of the tested shear bond strength values, including those that deviated from the firing temperatures in the manufacturer‘s instructions were, without exception, above the minimum specification of 25 MPa. Most of the series did not vary significantly. The significant variations could not be explained by the different firing positions. The cause was rather more to do with practice in manufacturing test specimens and associated greater shear bond strength, along with the concomitant decrease in standard deviation. Each time a comparison of the furnaces revealed a significant variation only in furnace Programat® P 90 with the ceramic tray, as described above. In summary, it can be asserted that the firing position in the furnace had no influence on the bonding strength. Similarly, the type of <b>firing</b> <b>tray</b> or furnace used had no effect on the bond strength. The visual impact on the aesthetic appearance was also assessed along with the bond strength. This showed that the firing conditions which differed from the manufacturer‘s instructions had an effect on the gloss characteristics of the ceramic. Series + 20 °C showed a more pronounced gloss characteristic of the ceramic, series 20 °C less gloss characteristic with a duller appearance, than the series fired according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test specimens fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions for the various firing positions, furnaces and <b>firing</b> <b>trays</b> showed no visual variations. Prior to the clinical application of known furnace fired metal ceramic restorations, the influence of the firing position on the bonding of the ceramic should be investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the firing position on the metal ceramic bonding under varying temperature conditions and after storage in a corrosive solution should be ascertained before clinical use can be recommended...|$|R

Based on the assumption that the ceiling jet flow entrains hot gas from the upper smoke layer, a model has been proposed to predict the temperature of the jet flow for vertical cable fire. Unlike the existing models, the effect of upward spreading flame on the temperature was taken into account. Fire experiments were conducted under different cable layouts to examine the model. Good agreement between the temperature predicted by the model and the experimental results was achieved, despite that the fire behaviour varied significantly with the cable spacing...|$|R

40|$|The ETANKFIRE {{project is}} focused on tank fires {{involving}} ethanol; the work conductedin {{this part of the}} ETANKFIRE project (WP 1 and WP 2) has been focused on tankfirefighting operations. Two series of fire extinguishing tests in reduced scale have been conducted. Both testseries simulated tank fire conditions by using a large amount of fuel and long preburntimes. The influence of foam application techniques, foam characteristics, and applicationrates have been investigated. Some tests have also included alternative extinguishingmedia such as cellular glass, liquid nitrogen and aqueous vermiculite dispersion (AVD). In total 29 extinguishing tests were conducted in the first test series using a 0, 41 m 2 firetray and 14 tests were conducted in the second test series using a 3, 14 m 2 <b>fire</b> <b>tray.</b> Priorto the experimental work a literature review was conducted to gain experience, both fromreal tank fire incidents and from various test and system design standards for the use offoam on water-miscible fuel fires. The results showed the importance of the characteristics of the finished foam. Higherfoam expansion ratios and longer drainage times resulted in significantly improved fireperformance. These improved foam characteristics are dependent on the foam applicationhardware as well as the foam concentrate formulation. To obtain these improvedcharacteristics the foam concentration was increased to 6 % from a nominal value of 3 %On the other hand, the improved foam characteristics allowed the application rate to bereduced by 50 % without compromising extinguishing performance. This shows that theperformance requirements in existing test standards for foam (e. g. UL 162, EN 1568) donot provide an incentive for manufacturers to formulate their foam to handle more severefire conditions, such as a tank fire scenario. The tests also indicated that gentle application of the foam is not guaranteed by the use offoam pourers (Type II discharge outlet according to NFPA 11) as the foam was not ableto flow gently along the tank wall due to high steel temperatures. With respect to alternative media, applying a layer of cellular glass followed by foamapplication made the extinguishing operation even more robust. The overall conclusion is that fighting ethanol tank fires would very likely result in afailure to extinguish if standard firefighting operations are used. However, the test resultsalso indicate important parameters that would improve the possibilities for a successfulextinguishment. Further validation of these results in larger scale could also providepossibilities to improve foam system standards, e. g. NFPA 11 and EN 13565 - 2 forextinguishment of water-miscible fuels as well as test standards for foam concentrates(e. g. UL 162, EN 1568 - 4).

40|$|The {{flexural}} and compressive {{properties of}} {{glass reinforced polyester}} (GRP) plates after exposure to fire are investigated. Large plates of the GRP composite were exposed to a kerosene fuel <b>tray</b> <b>fire</b> for times up to 10 min. The plates suffered thermally induced damage which increased with exposure time and consisted of charring, due to combustion of the polyester matrix, and delamination cracking. The residual flexural and compressive properties were measured at room temperature, and were found to decrease rapidly with increasing exposure time. It is shown that the post-fire structural properties can be approximated by modelling the burnt plate as a bi-layer material using a rule-of-mixtures formulation. It is proposed that the models {{can be used to}} estimate the structural deterioration after a fire of flat single-skin plates used in GRP ship construction. Crown © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a study to develop a standard fire test for 5 -gal containers used for storing combustible fluids in underground coal mines. A standard test method was developed which evaluates {{the performance of the}} container in a 4 -min <b>tray</b> <b>fire.</b> Bureau investigators used the standard test method to evaluate several types of closed 5 -gal plastic and metal cans in outdoor tests. Each can tested contained 1 gal of nonfire-resistant (NFR) hydraulic oil. A container failed the test if it lost its contents in any of seven trials. Contents spilled either as a result of thermal rupture or melting. Fewer than 10 pct of the metal containers failed this criterion, but all the plastic containers failed. The metal container failures were usual-ly due to tipping over during pressure relief, which spilled the NFR oil. Replacing the NFR oil in the container with kerosene resulted in failure of more than 30 pct of the metal containers. The standard tests and preliminary tests showed that plastic containers are not equivalent to metal containers in their ability to contain combustibles such as lubricants and greases in a fire. For solvents and lubricants more volatile than NFR hydraulic oil, approved metal safety containers are recommended...|$|R
40|$|A {{facility}} {{to evaluate the}} fire endurance of mine stoppings was constructed by the Bureau of Mines in the multiple entry section of the Bruceton (PA) Experimental Mine. Stoppings up to 6 by 18 ft can be tested in a manner simulating mine conditions. The stopping is subjected to a 70 -min liquid fuel <b>tray</b> <b>fire</b> with an energy output of 75, 000 Btu/min. The stopping and adjacent areas are instrumented with thermocouples and heat flux gauges. Data acquisition is by an automatic data logger capable of continuously recording over 100 channels of information. Two 8 -in-thick concrete block stoppings and a galvanized steel stopping were tested. A crack developed on the fire side surface of the block stoppings where the flames were most intense. However, the temperatures of the unexposed surfaces of the stoppings never exceeded 800 C and the surfaces were undamaged. The steel stopping retained its structural integrity during the test. The temperature of the unexposed steel surface reached 5000 C, but combustible materials located 1 ft from the surface did not ignite. A 3 / 4 -in-thick coating of construction plaster {{was applied to the}} fire side of the previously tested uncoated steel stopping. The quantity of heat energy transmitted across this coated metal stopping was reduced approximately 50 %. All stoppings prevented the passage of flame and smoke...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} video fire analysis (VFA) to a cable <b>tray</b> <b>fire</b> scenario, a scenario of interest to nuclear power plants where cables constitute {{a substantial part of}} the combustible load. Five horizontal trays, each 2. 4 m long and 0. 45 m wide, are positioned with a 0. 3 m spacing (in the vertical direction) and set-up against an insulated wall. Each tray contains 49 power PVC cables of 13 mm outer diameter. Ignition is performed with an 80 kW propane burner centrally positioned at 0. 2 m below the first (i. e. lowest) tray. Thanks to a flame detection algorithm, the VFA technique allows a reconstruction of the heat release rate (HRR) profile based on the estimated temporal evolution of flame and extinction fronts at the level of each tray. The obtained profile is generally in good agreement with the HRR measurements (from oxygen depletion calorimetry). However, the time to reach the peak HRR is overestimated by approximately 100 s and the peak HRR of 3 MW is underestimated by 17 %. These results are nevertheless encouraging because they provide confidence in the flame spread measurements (which are estimated for the case at hand between 2 mm/s and 5 mm/s). Therefore, a systematic application of VFA to real-scale experiments is believed to generate a valuable set of data (e. g. flame spread rates) for the development of simplified modellin...|$|R
40|$|On April 21, 1996, at 6 : 12 p. m., {{approximately}} 20 tons {{of molten}} glass were expelled from a 216 -ton body of molten (approximately 1600 {degrees}C) radioactively contaminated soil (containing 2. 4 Ci of {sup 137 }Cs) at a field site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The melt expulsion {{was caused by}} pressurized steam venting rapidly through, {{rather than by the}} desired path around, the molten body. During the previous 17 days, an old seepage pit was undergoing in situ vitrification (ISV) to convert it from porous, leachable soil into a monolithic, impermeable vitreous waste form. Approximately 2 MW of electrical power was being delivered to the molten body, which was contained in the ground and covered with a stainless steel hood maintained under negative pressure to collect, filter, scrub, and monitor off-gas. Off-gas into the hood was rapidly heated by the melt expulsion from a typical operating temperature of 250 {degrees}C to over 1000 {degrees}C with an associated surge of pressure sufficient to lift the 15, 000 -lb hood approximately 12 in. off the ground. A small pool of molten glass was able to flow up to 3 ft outside the hood while it was raised off the ground. The escaping hot off-gas and molten glass ignited several small fires in combustible components near or attached to the external hood frame (e. g, wire insulation, plastic hose, fiberglass <b>trays).</b> <b>Fire</b> department personnel responded to the emergency notification within minutes but were not needed because the small fires self-extinguished within an hour. Four project personnel were performing tasks at the site {{at the time of the}} melt expulsion; none were injured or contaminated during the melt expulsion incident.

5000|$|The Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Saint-Chamond was a {{howitzer}} {{of relatively}} advanced design for its time. It used a hydro-spring recoil system mounted below the barrel {{and had a}} small gun shield. The box carriage had wooden wheels so {{it could only be}} towed as a single load at low speeds by vehicles or by a team of 8 horses The barrel was drawn back over the trail for towing. It had a semi-automatic vertical sliding block breech that ejected the cartridge case after <b>firing.</b> A loading <b>tray</b> was attached to the carriage on a swinging mount. It fired a 43.5 kg high-explosive (Obus FA Mle 1915) shell to a range of 9300 m. The ammunition was [...] "semi-fixed" [...] the propellent was packaged in small bags in a brass cartridge and the total propellent charge could be adjusted by changing the number of bags. The Saint-Chamond howitzer was unique among French guns in that it had rear-positioned trunnions. The advantage of rear-positionedtrunnions is that the breech doesn't [...] "disappear" [...] into a box trail {{as is the case with}} trunnions mounted at the centre of gravity of the barrel and receiver. This means that the howitzer can be loaded at high elevation angles since the breech position does not change significantly throughout the elevation range. The disadvantage of rear-positioned trunnions is that the elevation system must be more robustsince it must bear greater forces from the barrel weight. To reduce the forces on the elevation gearing an equilibrator is necessary, this is usually a spring, or in the case of the Saint-Chamond a pneumaticsystem. The Saint-Chamond elevation system also moved the gun shield along with the barrel which meant that the gun shield could be smaller than a fixed gun shield. The traverse system was similar to that of other French guns, a worm gear moved the carriage across the axle.|$|R
