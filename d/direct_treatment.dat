5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, <b>direct</b> <b>treatment</b> of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Gene therapy {{involves}} supplying {{a functional}} gene to cells lacking that function, {{with the aim}} of correcting a genetic disorder or acquired disease. Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This “germ line gene therapy” is {{considered by many to be}} unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, “somatic cell gene therapy”, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by <b>direct</b> <b>treatment</b> or by removal of the tissue, addition of the therapeutic gene or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and lung disorders.|$|E

500|$|When {{toothache}} {{results from}} dental trauma (regardless {{of the exact}} pulpal or periodontal diagnosis), the treatment and prognosis {{is dependent on the}} extent of damage to the tooth, the stage of development of the tooth, the degree of displacement or, when the tooth is avulsed, the time out of the socket and the starting health of the tooth and bone.

500|$|After 1835 many workhouses were {{constructed}} {{with the central}} buildings surrounded by work and exercise yards enclosed behind brick walls, so-called [...] "pauper bastilles". [...] The commission proposed that all new workhouses should allow for the segregation of paupers into at least four distinct groups, each to be housed separately: the aged and impotent, children, able-bodied males, and able-bodied females. [...] A common layout resembled Jeremy Bentham's prison panopticon, a radial design with four three-storey buildings at its centre set within a rectangular courtyard, the perimeter of which was defined by a three-storey entrance block and single-storey outbuildings, all enclosed by a wall. That basic layout, one of two designed by the architect Sampson Kempthorne (his other design was hexagonal with a segmented interior, sometimes known as the Kempthorne star), allowed for four separate work and exercise yards, one for each class of inmate. [...] Separating the inmates was intended to serve three purposes: to <b>direct</b> <b>treatment</b> to those who most needed it; to deter others from pauperism; and as a physical barrier against illness, physical and mental.|$|E

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Frequency of binge eating, vomiting, and other behaviours to control weight as well as abstinence from these behaviours. RESULTS [...] Cognitive behavioural treatment produced {{a significant reduction in}} the frequency of binge eating, vomiting, and other behaviours to control weight. The manual significantly reduced frequency of binge eating and weight control behaviours other than vomiting, and there was no change in the group on the waiting list. Full remission was achieved in five (24 %) of the group assigned to cognitive behavioural treatment, nine (22 %) of the group who used the manual, and two (11 %) of the group on the waiting list.

2500|$|Meditation-relaxation (MR) {{therapy is}} a {{published}} <b>direct</b> <b>treatment</b> for sleep paralysis. The treatment was partly {{derived from the}} neuroscientific hypothesis suggesting that attempting movement during sleep paralysis (e.g., due to panic-like reactions) can lead to neurological distortions of one's [...] "body image", possibly triggering hallucinations of shadowy human-like figures. The therapy is based on four steps applied during sleep paralysis: (1) reappraisal {{of the meaning of}} the attack (cognitive reappraisal); which entails closing one's eyes, avoid panicking and re-appraising the meaning of the attack as benign. (2) psychological and emotional distancing (emotion regulation); the sleeper reminds him- or herself that catastrophizing the event (i.e., fear and worry) will worsen and possibly prolong it; (3) inward focused-attention meditation; focusing attention inward on an emotionally salient positive object; 4) muscle relaxation; relaxing one's muscles, avoid controlling breathing and avoid attempting to move.There are preliminary case reports supporting this treatment, although no randomized clinical trials yet to show its effectiveness.|$|E
