5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as <b>fraudulent,</b> and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been <b>fraudulent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Treaties of 1823 and 1826, {{although}} <b>fraudulent</b> {{at their}} roots, {{were allowed to}} stand.

5|$|A {{number of}} decrees that were {{probably}} <b>fraudulent</b> were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, {{and it is}} believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas.

5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people {{took advantage of the}} flood victims, including <b>fraudulent</b> contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford's law, {{the probability that the}} first decimal-digit of an item in the data sample is d (from 1 to 9) equals , regardless of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the data can be expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect <b>fraudulent</b> accounting.|$|E
5|$|Buendía was {{recognized}} largely for his investigative reporting, and particularly for his {{coverage of the}} CIA's covert operations in Mexico, the rise of ultra-rightwing groups, <b>fraudulent</b> businessmen, corruption in Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex, {{and the role of}} organized crime in Mexico's political system. He was also famous for breaking news on controversial political subjects thanks to his access to top Mexican officials. His investigative reporting, however, angered many and made him a frequent target of death threats, which he took very seriously.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was <b>fraudulent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being <b>fraudulent</b> at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for the reputation of the accounting profession.

5|$|During {{the rule}} of {{military}} leader Manuel Noriega, Arias was an opposition leader {{as the president of}} the Christian Democratic Party of Panama, a member party of the Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance (ADOC). He ran on the ticket of three-time former president Arnulfo Arias (no relation) in the 1984 election as the National Alliance of Opposition's candidate for Second Vice President. Arnulfo Arias was narrowly defeated by Noriega ally Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, and the opposition stated that the election had been <b>fraudulent.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Fraudulent</b> {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, the U.S. Department of the Interior was {{in serious}} {{disrepair}} due to corruption and incompetence. Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, discovered {{to have taken}} bribes for <b>fraudulent</b> land grants, {{was forced to resign}} from office on October 15, 1875. Delano had also given lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work, nor were they qualified to hold such surveying positions.|$|E
5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in <b>fraudulent</b> measure, and prohibited <b>fraudulent</b> collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E

In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks {{to be carried out}} as soon as possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used <b>fraudulent</b> passports to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a <b>fraudulent</b> practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated {{on the tarmac}} at Manila International Airport.

Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino was recognized as president.|$|E
5|$|Once Romania {{recovered}} possession {{over its}} southern areas, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was reportedly prosecuted for treason and was again sent to Văcărești. Others however {{note that this}} last sentence, passed in 1919, was not in fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his <b>fraudulent</b> activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pitești share a prison with the convicted collaborationist journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, Ioan Slavici).|$|E
5|$|R. r. tristis (Pleske, 1892). Breeds in China and Central Asia, {{wintering}} {{in northeastern}} Afghanistan. Records of this race from Ladakh claimed by Meinertzhagen {{are considered to}} be <b>fraudulent.</b> It is distinctive, with the black edges to the crest largely absent. The crown of the male is yellower than in other forms, and the underparts are much duller and greyer.|$|E
5|$|Registration of Business: Business {{registration}} {{is linked to}} a Lebanese Identity Card holder's Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) to help identify them as the true owner of their business. The Registrar General’s Department make it a requirement for all business owners to provide their PIN on the Lebanese Identity Card during business registration. This eliminates business registration fraud through the exposure of false identities and prevents multiple registrations of businesses for <b>fraudulent</b> purposes.|$|E

5|$|Two Deputy Returning Officers {{were charged}} by the DGEQ with violating {{elections}} laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal), after {{it was found that}} the ballots were not rejected in a <b>fraudulent</b> or irregular manner, and that there was no proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E

5|$|A Twitterbot is a {{computer}} program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were <b>fraudulent</b> in 2013. These fake accounts are often {{used to build large}} follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase. Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging <b>fraudulent</b> conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as <b>fraudulent.</b> When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing {{his home state of}} New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely {{as the result of a}} <b>fraudulent</b> voting practice known as Blocks of Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.|$|E
5|$|At a Missouri state {{constitutional}} convention in 1875, delegates {{from the region}} agreed on a separation plan. A Board of Freeholders from St. Louis county and city reorganized boundaries and proposed a final plan of separation in mid-1876. The new city charter also tripled {{the size of the}} city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the MissouriMississippi confluence to the mouth of the River Des Peres. After a <b>fraudulent</b> election initially showed a rejection of the plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters had approved the separation.|$|E
5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with slackness. There were rumors that Williams was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for <b>fraudulent</b> customhouse entries. The Senate Judiciary Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a <b>fraudulent</b> {{referendum}} in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
