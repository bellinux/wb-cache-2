To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: [...] "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" [...] in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing <b>information</b> <b>package</b> insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.|$|E

40|$|Cross-language {{comparison}} {{shows that}} in expressing <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> [...] -i. e., the structuring of propositional content in function of the speaker's assumptions about the hearer's knowledge and attentional state [...] -, different languages exploit word order and prosody in different ways. In other words, one single informational construct is realized by drastically different structural means across languages. Thus for English and Dutch {{it can be argued}} that, roughly speaking, <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> is structurally realized by means of alternative intonational contours of identical strings. But languages such as Catalan and Turkish, on the other hand, have a constant prosodic structure and realize <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> by means of string order permutations. The present paper investigates how the various structural realizations of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> can be handled by a sign-based categorial grammar formalism which takes its inspiration from Oehrle's (1988, 1993) work on genera [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{awareness of the}} large degree of crosslinguistic diversity involved in the structural realisation of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> (or <b>information</b> structure). Whereas English and many Germanic languages primarily exploit intonation for informational purposes, in other languages, like Catalan, syntax plays the primary role in the realisation of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> and intonation is reduced to a secondary role. In yet another group of languages the primary structural correlate is morphology. This paper provides a contrastive analysis of the structural properties of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> {{in a number of}} languages. It also contains a discussion of some basic issues concerning <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> and identifies a set of information-packaging primitives that are applied to the crosslinguistic facts. 1 Introduction Alternative sentential structures, differing in string order, in intonational structure, or in both, may be used to express the same propositional content.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the interpretive signi#cance of the basic <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> {{concepts}} of link and focus. We will argue that a discourse-representation -theoretical approach yields a generalized theory of link and focus interpretation that {{may contribute to the}} integration of pragmatic theories of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> with work in formal semantics, since it provides a sound background for an analysis of the phenomenon commonly referred to as `association with focus' that is also capable of handling the attested cases where `focus-sensitive' expressions do not associate with the focus of the sentence. These include cases where such expressions associate with so-called `second occurrence focus', with proper subparts of the focus, and with non-focal links. 1 Introduction 1. 1 <b>Information</b> <b>Packaging</b> The basic idea of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> is that speakers do not present information in an unstructured way,but that they provide a hearer with detailed instructions on how to manipula [...] ...|$|R

This paper explicitly illustrates that old arguments cannot stand still in information structure, but must undergo some kind of structural changes or deletion.

40|$|In this paper, a {{framework}} is {{developed for the}} study of information update in naturally occurring information dialogues, that takes into account the information structure of the individual utterances. It is based on the dialogue theory of Bunt(1994, 1995), the topic management work of Rats (1996), and the <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> theory of Vallduv'i (1990). The framework is tested on a corpus of 111 telephone conversations recorded at the information service of Schiphol. The results are promising which gives us the hope that it may serve as the point of departure for a study of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> in other naturally occurring conversations as well. Introduction In this paper, we will describe a theoretical framework {{for the study of}} information update in naturally occurring conversations.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} two corpus studies of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> of discourse referents in German {{dedicated to the}} following questions: • Do sentence-initial position, pronominalization and subject role assignment reflect a single un-derlying dimension of discourse salience or multiple dimensions? • If there are multiple dimensions of salience, {{is it possible to}} associate them with a forward-looking and a backward-looking perspective on discourse, as proposed, e. g., in the context of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995) ? This paper presents empirical findings from TüBa-D/Z, a corpus of German newspaper articles, that provide evidence against a unidimensional model of discourse salience, and support the claim that (at least) two dimensions of salience are to be distinguished and that these dimensions are associated with different temporal orientations on discourse. 1 Salience and <b>Information</b> <b>Packaging</b> In the last 30 years, the notion of “salience ” has been employed in many accounts for the <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> of discourse referents, especially with respect to the choic...|$|R
