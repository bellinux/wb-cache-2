40|$|In this work, {{stresses}} and natural frequencies of {{axial flow fan}} are evaluated. Various combinations of <b>hub</b> <b>thickness</b> and ring thickness are considered to calculate {{stresses and}} frequencies. It is observed that in case of solid hub the maximum stresses are induced at root of the blade and if {{the thickness of the}} hub reduces the stresses {{at the root of the}} blade increases and natural frequency decreases. Finite element analysis is done on impeller for investigation of stresses and natural frequency...|$|E
30|$|Numerical {{modelling}} {{has been}} increasingly {{used with the}} advancement in computing capability. For example, Schneider [7] used the ring element to build a finite element model for a train wheel and calculated sound radiation of the wheel using the Rayleigh integral method. Thompson used a two-dimensional finite element model to analyse the free vibration characteristics of a train wheel in detail [8] and the two-dimensional boundary element method to analyse sound radiation. In another work [9], he studied the influences of wheel diameter, web, and <b>hub</b> <b>thickness</b> on sound radiation efficiency and directivity of the wheel and produced formulae for sound radiation efficiency via curve fitting.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a parametric study of the behaviour of metal-to-metal contact flanges that have different surface profiles. Using a finite element analysis approach, the important stress values in the flange and bolts and flange rotation/displacement have been obtained for variations in flange thickness, bolt pre-stress and taper angle (different surface profiles) whilst maintaining other leading flange dimensions (hub length and <b>hub</b> <b>thickness)</b> constant, when the vessel/flange component is subjected to internal pressure. In addition, results are compared for the flange geometry with no taper angle on the flange surface with the predictions obtained from the appropriate sections of the ASME, PD 5500 and new European unfired pressure vessel standard EN 13445 Part 3. Based on the results of this study, the best flange dimensions are recommended for 'no leak' conditions from the joint...|$|E
40|$|To model {{shrink-fitting}} {{in metal}} components, an analytical model for two long compound cylinders with temperature dependent material properties and interference {{between them is}} developed for calculating transient temperatures and stresses. A finite element model is developed for the same geometry which incorporated the temperature dependent material properties. A convergence study is performed on the finite element and analytical model. The finite element model is validated by comparing the approximations of finite element model with the analytical solution. In an assembly procedure of fulcrums for bascule bridges, called AP 1, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into a hub, followed by shrink fitting the trunnion-hub assembly into the girder of the bridge. In another assembly procedure called AP 2, the hub is shrink-fitted into the girder, followed by shrink-fitting the trunnion in the hub-girder assembly. A formal design of experiments (DOE) study is conducted on both AP 1 and AP 2 using the finite element model to find the influence of geometrical parameters such as radial <b>thickness</b> of the <b>hub,</b> radial interference, and various shrink-fitting methods on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL) - a measure of likelihood of failure by cracking. Using the results of DOE study conducted on both the assembly procedures, AP 1 and AP 2 are quantitatively compared for the likelihood of fracture during assembly. For single-staged shrink-fitting methods, for high and low <b>hub</b> radial <b>thickness</b> to <b>hub</b> inner diameter ratio, assembly procedure AP 1 and AP 2 are recommended, respectively. For fulcra with low <b>hub</b> radial <b>thickness</b> to <b>hub</b> inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, for AP 2, cooling the trunnion in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder, and for AP 1, cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen is recommended. For fulcra with high <b>hub</b> radial <b>thickness</b> to <b>hub</b> inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, cooling the components in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder is recommended for both AP 1 and AP 2. Due to the limitations of AP 2, assembly procedures by heating the girder with heating coils instead of dipping an already stressed trunnion-hub assembly in liquid nitrogen are studied for decreasing the likelihood of failure by cracking and yielding. In an assembly procedure called AP 3 -A, only the girder is heated to shrink-fit the trunnion-hub assembly in the girder. This assembly procedure AP 3 -A {{is found to be}} infeasible because the girder fails by yielding if heating is expected to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An alternative assembly procedure called AP 3 -B is suggested for shrink-fitting where the heating of the girder is combined with cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture. This assembly procedure AP 3 -B is found to be feasible. A complete DOE study is conducted on AP 3 -B to find the influence of parameters like <b>hub</b> radial <b>thickness</b> and radial interference at trunnion-hub interface on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length. The design parameter, OMCCL values during the assembly procedure AP 3 -B are quantitatively compared with the widely used assembly procedures (AP 1 single-stage shrink-fitting and AP 1 multi-staged shrink fitting). The results of this work suggest that increasing the <b>hub</b> radial <b>thickness</b> decreases the likelihood of fracture significantly. For hubs with large radial thickness, heating the girder combined with cooling the trunnion-hub in dry-ice/alcohol mixture (AP 3 -B) is recommended but for hubs with low radial thickness, multistage cooling of the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture followed by dipping in liquid nitrogen (AP 1 - multistage cooling) is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flywheel rotor {{structure}} {{is one of}} essential assemblies of the flywheel system used in IPACS. It is significant {{to ensure the safety}} of metallic hub and the composite rim under high centrifugal loading induced by the rotation field and the surface pressure produced by the interface misfits. In this paper a 3 -D stress analysis model of the flywheel rotor is presented with the finite element analysis software ANSYS and the failure criteria of the materials are discussed to assess the structural strength. Moreover, the key design parameters are investigated briefly to disclose their influences on the stress distribution of rotor structure. At last, an optimum mathematics model with the outer radius of metallic <b>hub,</b> the <b>thickness</b> of each composite ring and the interface misfits as the design variables is presented. Based on the optimum design platform, the series of flywheel rotor structures can be designed systematically...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 28) Expansion joints utilizing bellows {{are used}} in rocket engine propellant ducts to allows engine angulation and provide an additional feature of isolating mechanical vibrations in one portion of a structure {{from other parts of}} the system. In the present application bellows are located in ducts supplying liquid oxygen to large rocket engine combustors and must accommodate the differential motion isolating the space vehicle from vibrations of the engine and the engine angulation required for thrustvector control. Because of the high pressure levels in the oxygen ducts a tension restraint center linkage is used in each bellows, consistiing of two oppositely directed interlocking tripods attached to the rigid external support rings that join the bellows to the duct ends. Bellows with an internal restraint linkage made of Inconel 718 have failed in the center of the linkage. The tripod design was remodified by changing the <b>hub</b> <b>thickness</b> at the critical center notch location, yet two modified restraint links failed again. The reasons for failure of this interim strut modification, which was indicated by theoretical analysis to be significantly superior to the original design, are considered in this thesis. The results of strain gage experiments on a third interim design and the analysis of the microstructure of the failure area of a restraint joints showed that the major cause for failure was residual stress. A small increase in the stress levels at the critical notch region is found to be due to the lack of weld fusion in that area. This investigation was made possible through NASA Contract number NASS- 27980...|$|E
