2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 October 2000, Lukwiya {{received}} a phone call from Opira informing him that a mysterious illness had killed two of the hospital's student nurses, all of whom had begun bleeding or vomiting blood. [...] Opira asked Lukwiya for help and he arrived that evening, in time to witness the death of a third nursing student, Daniel Ayella. [...] He had head nurse Sister Maria Di Santo bring him the charts of all unusual deaths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> and identified 17 cases with similar symptoms. [...] Lukwiya and Sr. Maria spent most of that night reading reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on infectious diseases that caused bleeding. [...] By the end of their review, they suspected Ebola. [...] The literature on Ebola, largely based on a 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Congo that had killed four (4) out of five (5) patients, stated that the sicker a patient, the more infectious they became. [...] Dead bodies themselves were highly contagious. Lukwiya immediately recognised this as a particular problem in Acholiland, where the traditional practice was for the bereaved family to wash the body of the deceased before burial.|$|E

The divisive, anti-minority rhetoric heard around the world today has the potential to escalate into ethnic violence, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, signs of which are already strongly taking shape in Myanmar. The Jewish people, who are far too often targeted with violence and bigotry, must not remain silent {{in the face of such}} extremism, no matter where or how it rears its head. The World Jewish Congress urges the international community to safeguard the rights of all minority communities, including those threatened by sectarian violence and oppression". The United States Holocaust Museum issued a statement that it was [...] "horrified by the ongoing attacks on Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State, western Burma, and calls on the Burmese government to immediately cease its military operations in the region. According to reports, this campaign includes the widespread and systematic targeting of Rohingya with killing, rape, torture, and forced displacement. The Museum reiterates its deep concern about these ongoing mass atrocities, including the risk of genocide".|$|E
