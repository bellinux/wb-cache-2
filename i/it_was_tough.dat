5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

Mouton considered the S1 the most difficult rally car she had driven: [...] "For rallying on asphalt, I agree the limit had gone too far.

[...] "Mika had a great race," [...] he said. [...] "His victory may have looked easy, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to achieve and in my view {{this was one of}} his best drives ever." [...] Michael Schumacher said that although he was unable to catch Häkkinen, he was happy to finish in second position. Coulthard said that he believed that his car's suffered from balance issues before taking his first pit stop which accounted for his lack of pace. He also added that spending time behind back-markers during the second stint hindered his attempts to overtake Michael Schumacher but admitted that third position was his best possible result.|$|E

Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack.

[...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it."

The Giants {{sought for}} him to alter the angle of his head during his delivery, but after Bumgarner {{struggled}} over his first three starts in Augusta, he reverted {{to the way he}} had thrown in high school. With Augusta, he worked on the changeup, the slider, and [...] "the ability to pitch inside." [...] When asked if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to work on off-speed pitches in a league in which most of the hitters can be fooled with the fastball, Bumgarner replied, [...] "The minors are all about player development. I needed to work on other pitches and have the confidence to throw them." [...] He won the South Atlantic League pitchers' Triple Crown, tying for the league lead in wins (15, tied with Levi Maxwell), leading the league in earned run average (1.46), and leading the league in strikeouts (164). He began the 2009 season with the Giants' High-A affiliate, the San Jose Giants of the California League. After five starts, in which he went 3–1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts, he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate, the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League. On July 22, he hit a grand slam against Eric Niesen and picked up the victory in a 9–3 triumph over the Binghamton Mets. In 20 games (19 starts) with them, he went 9–1 with a 1.93 ERA and 69 strikeouts.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{production}} struggles of The Lord of the Rings, Bakshi decided {{to work on}} something more personal. He pitched American Pop to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film in which songs would be given a new context in juxtaposition to the visuals. American Pop follows four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians, whose careers parallel the history of American pop and starred actor Ron Thompson in a dual lead role. While the film does not reflect Bakshi's own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by people he had encountered in Brownsville. The film's crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams. Bakshi again used rotoscoping, {{in an attempt to}} capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film's story. According to Bakshi, [...] "Rotoscoping is terrible for subtleties, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to get facial performances to match the stage ones." [...] Bakshi was able to acquire the rights to an extensive soundtrack—including songs by Janis Joplin, The Doors, George Gershwin, The Mamas & the Papas, Herbie Hancock, Lou Reed, and Louis Prima—for under $1 million. Released on February 12, 1981, the film was a financial success. The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "I'm amazed at the success that Mr. Bakshi has in turning animated characters into figures of real feelings." [...] Jerry Beck called it [...] "one of Bakshi's best films". Due to music clearance issues, it was not released on home video until 1998.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E
