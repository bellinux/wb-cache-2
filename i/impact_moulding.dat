40|$|The <b>impact</b> of <b>mould</b> filling {{parameters}} {{on casting}} {{defects in shape}} complicated skeleton casting was investigated. Skeleton castings are low weight cellular material mainly used for energy absorption in for example automotive industry. For prediction of defects such as porosities, the computer simulations of mould filling and solidification were used. In such shape complicated structures like skeleton castings {{it is very difficult}} to predict localization of the defects. This knowledge is very important to gain information about deformation mechanisms and for impact behaviour modelling. Series of the skeleton castings were investigated by computer tomography to validate simulations results...|$|R
40|$|Building {{materials}} {{differ in}} their susceptibility to mould growth. Wood is a material often considered to have a low mould resistance. However, wood is not a homogenous material and different characteristics of the material {{are expected to have}} an <b>impact</b> on <b>mould</b> growth. In this paper, it was shown that wood species (pine or spruce), sawing pattern (centre-board or side-board) and surface structure (planed or sawn) affected mould growth. In addition, it was indicated that the susceptibility cannot be described by one single parameter, but also depends on other parameters. It is therefore difficult to estimate the susceptibility of wood in general. These conclusions were drawn from a meta-analysis, using data from five separate, previously performed laboratory studies conducted at 90 % relative humidity and 22 °C, and from a laboratory study performed at 95 % RH and 22 °C...|$|R
40|$|This report aims at {{showing the}} <b>impact</b> of <b>mould</b> and {{dampness}} on {{living in a}} healthy home. An unhealthy home is supposed to promote illnesses, more or less severe, and leads in consequence to (direct health) costs for medication or even hospital admission {{and on the other}} hand to (more indirect) economic costs when employees are sick and could not do their work. In this study report, the scientific foundation for the relationship between mould and dampness and respiratory illnesses of building occupants is shown. To achieve a magnitude about the effect of mould in homes on respiratory diseases, a meta-analytic synthesis is done in order to summarize the available statistical data. Ina further step, a projection about the potential of modernizing the building stock and reducing mould sources on lowering the impact on the occupants’ health has been made and measures for improvement are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of economy and industry introducing {{new technologies and}} materials often means the increased threat of occurrenceof factors harmful to humans and environment. Workers employed in foundries as mould pourers are the group of high professional risk. Foundry moulding sands when poured with liquid metal {{are a source of}} the emission of harmful, toxic and carcinogenic (benzene,PAHs) compounds. The paper presents the results of studies on the concentration of chemical compounds emitted in the process of casting aluminiumalloy and brass using moulding sands with the new inorganic binders. The specific values of the exposure indices were compared with thelimit values. This enabled an assessment of the <b>impact</b> of <b>moulding</b> sands on work environment. The obtained results were compared withthe values of contaminants emitted when pouring foundry moulds made from furan sands and bentonite sands with an addition of coaldust.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an onset {{is given to}} whole {{building}} modelling by investigating the impact of wind-driven rain (WDR) on indoor climate and mould growth at interior wall surfaces. The hy-grothermal behaviour of a cubic building with solid brick walls is numerically analysed. The simula-tions demonstrate {{that the impact of}} WDR loads on the moisture contents in the walls is much larger {{near the edge of the}} walls than at the centre. For the case analysed, WDR causes an increase of in-door relative humidity of up to 51 % and an increase of energy consumptions for heating by 11 % in winter and by 12 % in summer respectively; while a much smaller impact on indoor humidity and a very small impact on energy consumption are seen in spring and autumn. Furthermore the obtained relative humidity and temperature at the interior wall surfaces are combined with isopleths of gen-eralised spore germination time of fungus mould. The results show that WDR loads can have a sig-nificant <b>impact</b> on <b>mould</b> growth especially at the edge of the wall. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results concerning impact of modification (volume and surface techniques), pouring temperature and mould temperature on stereological parameters of macrostructure in IN 713 C castings made using post-production scrap. The ability to adjust the grain size {{is one of the}} main issues in the manufacturing of different nickel superalloy castings used in aircraft engines. By increasing the grain size one can increase the mechanical properties, like diffusion creep resistance, in higher temperatures. The fine grained castings. on the other hand, have higher mechanical properties in lower temperatures and higher resistance to thermal fatigue. The test moulds used in this study, supplied by Pratt and Whitney Rzeszow, are ordinarily used to cast the samples for tensile stress testing. Volume modification was carried out using the patented filter containing cobalt aluminate. The macrostructure was described using the number of grains per mm 2, mean grain surface area and shape index. Obtained results show strong relationship between the modification technique, pouring temperature and grain size. There was no significant <b>impact</b> of <b>mould</b> temperature on macrostructure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} onset to whole {{building}} hygrothermal modelling {{in which the}} interaction between interior and exterior climates via building enclosures is simulated under a moderately cold and humid climate. The focus is particularly {{on the impact of}} wind-driven rain (WDR) on the hygrothermal response, mould growth at interior wall surfaces, indoor climate and energy consumption. First the WDR load on the facades of a 4 × 4 × 10 m 3 tower is determined. Then the hygrothermal behaviour of the brick walls is analysed on a horizontal slice through the tower. The simulations demonstrate that the impact of WDR loads on the moisture contents in the walls is much larger near the edges of the walls than at the centre. The obtained relative humidity and temperature at the interior wall surfaces are combined with isopleths of generalised spore germination time of fungus mould. The results show that WDR loads can have a significant <b>impact</b> on <b>mould</b> growth especially {{at the edges of the}} walls. Finally, for the case analysed, the WDR load causes a significant increase of indoor relative humidity and energy consumption for heating. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|E-glass/polypropylene, {{compression}} <b>moulding,</b> <b>impact,</b> mechanical properties, thermography In this paper, flat plaques of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites {{with different}} fibre architecture (2 -D, 3 -D) were non-isothermally compression moulded under various moulding conditions and then {{subjected to a}} number of different tests. These included drop-weight impact tests with a staircase procedure, Charpy impact tests and interlaminar shear strength. In particular, results from void content measurement using optical microscopy on these materials were put in relation with interlaminar shear strength and impact tests results on these materials. The results of these tests are discussed {{in the light of the}} moulding conditions and quality, and conclusions have been drawn regarding optimum <b>moulding</b> conditions for <b>impact</b> performance. Finally, indications on the reliability and possible improvement of the moulding procedure to yield an acceptable moulding quality, even with large thickness, are also provided...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the drop <b>impact</b> test for <b>moulded</b> plastics containers, {{as a first step}} towards the simulation of the impact event for design and development purposes. Experimental data are analysed from instrumented base drop impact testing of water-filled blow-moulded bottles, 20 and 210 l drums. Each type of container is found to exhibit a characteristic pulse time for the internal pressure during impact. Analysis shows that the observed behaviour of the flexible container/water-filled system is normally best described in terms of solid body dynamics, rather than an approach based on water hammer concepts. A simple equivalent mass–spring model is developed which predicts the characteristic pulse time and pressure distribution {{on the walls of the}} vessel throughout the impact test. It is shown that this model should be applied when the length of the vessel does not exceed a critical length. An expression for determining this critical length is given. Loads and loading rates predicted by the mass–spring model can be used as input to a simplified FEM simulation of the drop impact test on any vessel...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Surface changes like wear {{or local}} plastic {{deformation}} occurring during service of a mould make it unsuitable for further use and determine its life-time. The performance of the mould and its design are important aspects that influence its longevity. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the behaviour of mould materials manufactured by laser sintering, a type of rapid manufacturing process, and to explain their relative in-service performance. Design/methodology/approach – Mould specimens were made by two laser-sintering machines (a DTM Sinterstation and an EOSint M 250 Xtended equipped with CO 2 lasers) using two iron-based commercial powders, i. e. LaserForm ST- 100 and DirectSteel 20 V 1, respectively. They have been subjected to two types of wear tests, i. e. bidirectional fretting and unidirectional pin-on-disc tests, under loading conditions leading to wear and/or plastic deformation of the specimens. The results obtained show similar trends to that obtained from the real-life performance of polymer injection moulds manufactured using such materials and processes. Findings – LaserForm is a better material for injection moulds material than DirectSteel; however, and its performance will deteriorate under <b>impact</b> injection <b>moulding</b> conditions where plastic surface deformation will occur in addition to abrasive wear. Both materials show high coefficient of friction, their performance will be enhanced by redesigning the composition of the powders by incorporating hard and low friction components. The methodology adopted here for investigating the surface degradation behaviours of materials is able to give sufficient and reliable information about the wear behaviour of mould materials for practical applications. Originality/value – It is concluded that the wear tests used here are suited to characterize the in-service mould wear strength, and such tests could be preferably used to shorten the mould development/validation time. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} 3 {{main sources of}} {{contamination}} of Australian grains used in livestock feeds, namely chemical residues, moulds and mycotoxins, and weed seeds, including natural toxins such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids. By evaluating the risk to livestock from chemical contaminants (pre-emergent herbicides, selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides used during growth phases and at pre-harvest, and post harvest insecticides) {{and the influence of}} chemical contaminants on livestock production efficiency and grain nutritional quality, the relative priorities for residue management strategies can be established. The chemicals with the highest priority for inclusion in a residue management strategy include bifenthrin (synthetic pyrethroid), chlorpyrifos-methyl (organophosphate), deltamethrin (synthetic pyrethroid), endosulfan (organochlorine), and fenitrothion (organophosphate). It also appears that the Australian maximum residue limit standards do not {{meet the needs of the}} livestock industries for effective management of residues in animal feeds, and consequently, a revised approach is required. The amount of research and literature available on the effects of mould and mycotoxin contamination of grain on livestock production, and techniques available for the measurement of moulds and mycotoxins, far exceeds the potential risk these contaminants pose to the livestock industries in Australia. In addition, the effects of moulds and mycotoxins are rarely widespread, with many accounts in the literature referring to a small number of animals on individual enterprises. The actual economic <b>impact</b> of <b>moulds</b> and mycotoxin contamination is also difficult to assess due to a lack of systematic surveys and varying livestock production responses to the presence of these compounds. Finally, weed seeds and the toxic components of weed seeds are still prevalent contaminants of Australian grains used in livestock feeds, and are responsible for significant livestock losses, but there is a lack of screening methods for qualitative or quantitative identification of these contaminants and a lack of uniform standards for use of contaminated grain...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to establish the level of contamination of dry cassava chips by moulds and aflatoxins and the associated factors. The {{study was conducted}} in Kumi district, Eastern Uganda where respondents from ninety households provided information on the cassava processing and storage practices. Samples of dried cassava chips were also obtained from the households for moisture, mould and aflatoxin analyses. The factors that <b>impact</b> on <b>mould</b> and aflatoxin contamination of these products were established using regression analysis. Cassava chips had mean moisture content of 10. 14 %. Mean mould count was 5. 0 x 10 4 cfu g - 1 and higher counts were associated with extent of visible mouldiness of the products. Rhizopus sp. were the most prevalent (66. 7 %) moulds identified, followed by Mucor (37 %), Penicillium (22. 2 %), Aspergillus (20. 4 %) and Fusarium species (5. 6 %). A. flavus was the most predominant mycotoxigenic mould isolated and occurred on 18. 5 % of the samples. Thirty percent of cassava samples tested positive for aflatoxin contamination with a range of 0 - 4. 5 μg kg - 1 and mean of 0. 51 μg kg - 1. Drying cassava chips on bare ground; storing by heaping on bare floor and storage in old containers such as Jerricans were among the practices positively associated with aflatoxin contamination. Improved practices like drying on tarpaulin were negatively associated with aflatoxin contamination. Since cassava chips are distributed from Eastern to other parts of Uganda, these results show that consumers are exposed to the risk of aflatoxin poisoning. Efforts should therefore be made {{to improve the quality of}} cassava by addressing its handling and processing practices in Uganda...|$|R
40|$|Background Carefully conducted, community-based, {{longitudinal}} studies {{are required to}} gain further {{understanding of the nature}} and timing of respiratory viruses causing infections in the population. However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Methods Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at - 80 àand later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV 3). The impact of ERV 3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the <b>impact</b> of visible <b>mould</b> observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV 3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. Results In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV 3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0. 35; 95 % confidence interval 0. 27 - 0. 44) was observed in samples where the ERV 3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV 3 loads and respiratory virus detection. Conclusion Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible <b>mould</b> can <b>impact</b> negatively upon sample quality. Quality control measures, including monitoring human DNA loads using ERV 3 as a marker for epithelial cell components in samples should be undertaken to optimize the validity of real-time PCR results for respiratory virus investigations in community-based studies.

40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} {{is a low}} pressure, {{high temperature}} manufacturing method and {{is considered to be}} the best for making large hollow shape plastic parts. Due to its long heating cycle, mould rotation during heating and slow cooling rate, it is completely different from injection or other moulding processes. The mechanical properties of rotationally moulded plastics are totally dependent on unique heating or cooling cycles. With the growing demand for rotationally moulded plastics in load bearing and other applications, {{a better understanding of the}}ir fracture properties is essential. In the rotational moulding process, multilayer plastic products such as skin-foam-skin three layered sandwich structures can be manufactured in a single manufacturing step without any joints. It exhibits relatively high stiffness, strength-to-weight ratios and is used increasingly in various applications such as automotive and marine. During the lifetime of the sandwich material, it may face multiple or repeated impact events. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a better understanding of the fracture behaviour of rotationally moulded plastics in order to use them in skin-foam-skin sandwich structure and reduce in-service failures due to <b>impact.</b> Here, rotationally <b>moulded</b> two different commercially available Polyethylene (PE) and Polypropylene (PP) plastics are tested. Microstructural details of the plastics are investigated here. Fracture properties, particularly fracture toughness properties are studied using J-integral elastic-plastic fracture mechanics approach to identify the fracture initiation point. Impact properties are also investigated at a wide range of temperatures. PE materials are found to have better fracture properties. It is observed that with the fracture toughness plastic’s microstructure particularly crystal and amorphous region thickness are related. The understanding from these works is followed by the manufacture of rotationally moulded skin-foam–skin sandwich structure and testing of low velocity impact properties of this structure from 20 J to 100 J energy level with a drop weight impact testing machine. PE is used for both in skin and core layer and sandwich samples are manufactured at four different skin-core thickness combinations. Impact force resistance and bending stiffness are found to be increased with an increase of both skin and core layer thickness. Low velocity repeated impact properties of the rotationally moulded sandwich samples are also investigated from 20 J to 50 J energy level at the end of this project to understand the effect of repeated impact on the sandwich structure. The samples are subjected to single impact event repeatedly up-to penetration at each energy level. Impact energy-impact number curve obtained from repeated impact test provides an equation for prediction of the number of repeated impacts for the penetration of the sandwich samples at each energy level...|$|R
