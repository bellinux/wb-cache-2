40|$|The <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> {{used in a}} deep-sea {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV) may undergo large displacement motion when subjected to dynamic actions of ship heave motion and ocean current. A novel geometrically exact finite element model for two-dimensional dynamic analysis of <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> is presented. This model accounts for the geometric nonlinearities of large displacement of the <b>armored</b> <b>cable,</b> and effects of axial load and bending stiffness. The governing equations are derived by consistent linearization and finite element discretization of the total weak form of the <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> system, and solved by the Newmark time　integration method. To make the solution procedure avoid falling into the local extreme points, a simple adaptive stepping strategy is proposed. The presented model is validated via actual measured data. Results for dynamic configurations, motion and tension of {{both ends of the}} <b>armored</b> <b>cable,</b> and resonance-zone are presented for two numerical cases, including the dynamic analysis under the case of only ship heave motion and the case of joint action of ship heave motion and ocean current. The dynamics analysis can provide important reference for the design or product selection of the <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> in a deep-sea ROV system so as to improve the safety of　its marine operation under the sea state of 4 or above.

30|$|Downhole {{geophysical}} {{borehole logging}} is an in situ nondestructive process of measuring the physical, chemical, and structural properties of penetrated geological formations and surrounding borehole annulus. The technique involves lowering of sonde (probe) into a borehole using suspended <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> or wire device called wireline or logging cable. The logging cable {{is connected to}} the winch and transmits recorded signals to the digital computers for data visualization, monitoring, and recording. The measured subsurface properties are dependent on the type of the lowered probe. Geophysical logs have been widely used, especially in petroleum industry, as tools in unraveling information on aquifer and fluid characteristics, paleo-hydrogeology, and correlation and distribution of subsurface sedimentary strata. Because geophysical logging is a repeatable and comparable process, {{it can be used to}} provide continuous in situ information on the subsurface rock type, bed thickness, permeability, porosity, bulk density, resistivity, and the nature of saturating fluids (Hallenburg 1987; Repsold 1989; Mares et al. 1994; Keys 1997; Buckley 2000; Hearst et al. 2000; Buckley et al. 2001). In addition, geophysical logs can confirm the completion details, identify the individual water inflows, characterize salinity and freshness, determine freshwater–saline water interface, and identify problems in cased boreholes (Buckley et al. 2001). It can therefore act as a guide in borehole designs and rehabilitating process of damaged boreholes.|$|R
40|$|When an {{underwater}} vehicle {{is to be}} towed by a surface craft at speeds greater than 1 or 2 knots, the tow cable designer faces several major problems. Included are overcoming the drag and lift forces that can limit tow vehicle depth and eliminating cable strumming,which causes fatigue failures. The usual solution is to add segments of fairing to the tow cable to change its hydrodynamic characteristics. However, this is normally a costly, time-consuming effort, especially on tow cable {{that does not have}} metallic armor.

The severe earthquake along with the heavy rainfall has induced landslide and debris flows so that the slope stability is a significant concern in this earthquake region. A newly developed inclinometer based on the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing technique has been installed in a slope in Sichuan Province for long-term monitoring of internal displacements. A series of FBG sensing bars are installed at different depths of two different boreholes in the slope; meanwhile, all optical fibers of the sensing bars are connected and extended to a monitoring station around 1000 m away from the slope site through a main <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> of optical fibers. Monitoring works are {{carried out in the}} monitoring station from 20 June to 25 September 2010. Thus, internal displacements of the slope are analyzed together with the rainfall data which are also collected by a rainfall gauge. The results demonstrate that rainfall infiltration has a strong influence on the internal displacements, while the influence reduces dramatically when the depth exceeds 5. 2 m. Through a numerical model for the effect analysis of rainfall intensity and duration, the slope stability decreases significantly when the rainfall intensity higher (or equal) than 0. 5 mm/h and rainfall duration longer than 100 h.

50|$|A {{remotely}} operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a tethered underwater mobile device. This meaning {{is different from}} remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew aboard a vessel. They are common in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits {{on top of the}} ROV.

The umbilical <b>cable</b> is an <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.|$|R
