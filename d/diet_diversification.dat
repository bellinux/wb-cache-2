40|$|Global climate {{shifts and}} {{ecological}} flexibility {{are two major}} factors that may affect rates of speciation and extinction across clades. Here, we connect past climate to changes in <b>diet</b> and <b>diversification</b> dynamics of ruminant mammals. Using novel versions of Multi-State Speciation and Extinction models, we explore the most likely scenarios for evolutionary transitions among diets in this clade and ask whether ruminant lineages with different feeding styles (browsing, grazing and mixed feeding) underwent differential rates of diversification concomitant with global temperature change. The best model of trait change had transitions from browsers to grazers via mixed feeding, with appreciable rates of transition to and from grazing and mixed feeding. Diversification rates in mixed-feeder and grazer lineages tracked the palaeotemperature curve, exhibiting higher rates during the Miocene thermal maxima. The origination of facultative mixed diet and grazing states may have triggered two adaptive radiations - one during the Oligocene-Miocene transition and the other during Middle-to-Late Miocene. Our estimate of mixed diets for basal lineages of both bovids and cervids is congruent with fossil evidence, while the reconstruction of browser ancestors for some impoverished clades - Giraffidae and Tragulidae - is not. Our results offer model-based neontological support to previous palaeontological findings and fossil-based hypothesis highlighting the importance of dietary innovations - especially mixed feeding - {{in the success of}} ruminants during the Neogene. 8 page(s...|$|R

Islands are {{biodiversity}} hotspots, {{and prominent}} models for observing and interpreting ecological and evolutionary patterns. Ecological diversification on islands typically results in divergence of ecological niches. The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) is {{a fragment of}} the Gondwana Supercontinent that was isolated from the Indian Ocean around 20 Myr ago when the Arabian and African plates separated. The reptile community living on this Archipelago is composed by 31 species, 29 of them endemic. In this study, trophic niche <b>diversification</b> (<b>diet</b> from faecal samples and stable isotopes from tail tips) of six gecko species of genera Haemodracon (two species) and Hemidactylus (four species) was examined. Each group conforms a monophyletic lineage with further intra*island speciation. Faecal samples and stable isotopes gave similar interspecific divergence between the six species examined. Models detected trophic*niche differences between sister species and also similarities between species of distant lineages. Microhabitat selection was a major factor that explained stable-isotope variation. Our results suggest that interspecific diet variation could be promoted by the occupation of different available microhabitats during ecological diversification. In a phylogenetic context, our study highlights some mechanisms that are driving reptile diversification and speciation in Socotra. N...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changes in}} the nature and quantity of Food consumption in India during the reforms decade of the 1990 s, and analyses their implications for calorie intake and undernourishment. The study documents the decline in cereal consumption, especially in the urban areas, and provides evidence that suggests an increase in the prevalence of undernourishment over the period, 1987 / 88 – 2001 / 2002. The results also point to a significant number of households, even in the top expenditure decile, suffering from under nourishment. This calls for a reassessment of the current strategy of directing the Targetted Public Distribution System (TPDS) exclusively at households “below the poverty line” (BPL). This study shows that, both as a source of subsidised calories and as a poverty reducing instrument, the PDS is of much greater importance to the female headed households than it is {{to the rest of the}} population. Another important result is that, notwithstanding the sharp decline in their expenditure share during the 1990 s, Rice and Wheat continue to provide the dominant share of calories, especially for the rural poor. The Indian experience is in sharp contrast to that in Vietnam which witnessed a large increase in calorie intake and, consequently, a decrease in the prevalence of ndernourishment in the late 1990 s.

40|$|Hexapoda (insects {{and their}} relatives) {{comprise}} {{over half of}} all described species, and demonstrates large variation in species richness among major sub-clades. This has led to various hypothesized controls responsible for structuring diversification within hexapod lineages, including morphological key innovations, dietary shifts (in particular plant feeding) and small body size. This thesis explores these ideas {{in the context of}} an explicit phylogenetic hypothesis for the group, constructed from published sequence data and literature derived constraints, and dated using a fossil calibrated relaxed molecular clock (Chapter 2). Based on this framework, models of the diversification process identify complete metamorphosis as a likely key innovation in the hexapod radiation, in addition to further up and down shifts in diversification rate responsible for the observed richness distribution (Chapter 3). Analysis also suggests that ideas regarding the role of plant feeding in diversification are related to restricted clade sampling, and a more comprehensive approach recovers no consistent association between particular <b>diets</b> and net <b>diversification</b> rates, in addition to heterogeneity in the age of dietary groups and in transition rates among dietary categories (Chapter 4). Our data also suggests body size evolution in hexapods occurs independently of clade richness, and is broadly dominated by neutral evolution on a log scale (Chapter 5). Thus, this thesis supports some hypotheses regarding controls on insect richness, whilst conflicting with other, well established ideas. It also provides a novel dated phylogenetic framework for further studies of hexapod evolution and identifies several novel directions for research into the origins and development of this diverse and important radiation...|$|R
40|$|Hornbills (Aves: family Bucerotidae) are {{a charismatic}} group of Palaeotropical birds {{recognised}} for their distinctive morphology (casque) and behaviour (nest-sealing). Hornbill diet, habitat use, distribution and social system display pronounced interspecific variation, and their mutualistic interactions with tropical fruits provide vital ecosystem services. A {{wide range of}} species of hornbills across the Afrotropics, Indo-Malaya and Melanesia are of conservation concern. However, the evolutionary history of hornbills remains unclear and there are conflicting hypotheses about their origin, tempo of diversification and biogeography. Despite a comprehensive cladistic analysis of phenotypic data, there are unresolved taxonomic uncertainties within the family, and although a gradual accumulation of molecular data has revealed interesting phylogenetic relationships, methodological limitations, and incomplete sampling, has left gaps and produced incongruent results. Hence the evolutionary framework against which to interpret the diversity of this group is incomplete. The aim of this thesis was to construct a well-resolved molecular phylogeny of hornbills, and {{to use it to}} address longstanding questions about the evolution and diversification of these remarkable birds. This thesis presents a broad phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis of the family Bucerotidae, based on a coalescence of molecular methods and comparative analyses, largely using historical samples and recently-developed bioinformatic approaches. I provide the first complete species-level molecular phylogeny of hornbills, derived from nuclear adenylate kinase 1 intron 5 and mitochondrial (mtDNA) cytochrome b genes, and also a comprehensive mtDNA phylogeny covering 98 % of the taxa, with extensive sampling of Asian geo-isolates. Using these two phylogenetic trees, I sought to determine the tempo of divergence, trace the evolution of traits, identify ancestral areas and colonisation routes, and also calculate genetic divergence. In this part of the work, I stress the importance of (1) using historical samples, (2) calibrating time-trees with fossil and molecular anchor-points, and (3) the use of a complete tree to test models of diversification and reconstruct ancestral states. My findings confirm the monophyly of Bucerotidae, showing nearly distinct African and Asian lineages, with relatively congruent topologies across different phylogenetic methods and genes. In turn, these gene trees were comparable with previous cladistic analysis based on phenotypic data. As a result, I was able to resolve some taxonomic issues and propose generic changes. Comparative analyses of social behaviour revealed that cooperative breeding is an ancestral trait, and its evolution in hornbills (in contrast with some other taxa) is associated with stable environments in combination with frugivory, territoriality and reduced body size. Analysis of the evolution of <b>diet</b> with <b>diversification</b> showed that the shift to frugivory from faunivorous African ancestors influenced the rapid diversification of Afro-Asian forest hornbills, facilitated by their preference for humid forests and mutualistic interactions with, hornbill-dispersed fruits (HDF). This dispersal of frugivorous lineages via the Palaeotropical Biotic Interchange promoted colonisation of Asia, with Sundaland being the centre of radiation for continental and insular Asian species. The gradual eastward colonisation from India to Melanesia matches palaeo-tectonic events that allowed dispersal across Huxley's, Wallace's and Lydekker's lines, and was congruent with historical biogeography of some HDFs. Finally, I used a combined analysis of genetic divergence and a standard scoring system for phenotypic data of Asian geo-isolates to provide evidence for quantitative delineation of species and propose changes in conservation status. My findings reveal the evolutionary history of horn bills from their emergence in the Late Oligocene from African origins, with a switch to frugivory influencing successful colonisation of hornbills and HDFs in Asian forests, which combined to promote sociality. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that access to novel environments and innovations to ecological niche facilitate rapid diversification in an avian lineage, and that this process is further promoted by the interplay of these birds in complex mutualistic interactions with their food, as well as palaeo-climatic and palaeo-tectonic changes.

Apex predators are sensitive to long-term climate-driven changes in prey populations and short-term effects of weather on prey availability, both of which could result in changes of diet. We investigated temporal trends and effects of long- and short-term environmental variability on chick diet composition in a North Sea population of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis between 1985 and 2014. The proportion of their principal prey, lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus, declined from 0. 99 (1985) to 0. 51 (2014), and estimated sandeel size declined from 104. 5 to 92. 0 mm.

Micronutrient malnutrition refers to the condition where individual unable to intake sufficient amount of macronutrients that compose largely of Vitamin A, Iron and Vitamin B 9 and do not show obvious symptoms (Ruel-Bergeron et ai., 2015). Micronutrient malnutrition severely affects both in under develop and developing countries. This incident occurs due to the expensive prices of vegetables and fruits, and low accessibility to obtain the nutritious vegetables and fruits compare to the high incomers, but micronutrients malnutrition also effect overweight children due to the unbalance food consumption that largely cause by salt, sugar, and addictive flavor. Several approaches like pharmaceutical supplementation, industrial food fortification, and <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> did help in reducing the micronutrient malnutrition problems but all the approaches success on the minimum rate. Thus, the research and development of transgenic rice rich essential micronutrients through bio-fortification method is another novel strategy to combat off the micronutrient malnutrition. Rice is a low micronutrients - major staple crop for almost half of the world population especially in under develop and developing countries. Even though, the rice production of 1 st generation of transgenic rice with high yielding output increase over the year, but it is still not enough to deliver enough intake of needed essential micronutrients. Then, the 1 st generation of transgenic rice shifts to the 2 nd generation of transgenic rice which are more consumers - friendly focusing on the nutritional value enhancement on the edible rice endosperm.

Recent reforms to the Agriculture Production Market Committee (APMC) Act and improvements in state-wide governance have provided further incentives for investment in the potato sector, particularly in cold storage facilities that can mitigate seasonal price fluctuations and improve the availability of potatoes.

We gathered 121 dietary studies, totalling 161, 456 prey for the Goshawk Accipiter gentilis L., Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos L., Bonelli’s Eagle Aquila fasciata Vieillot, and Eagle Owl Bubo bubo L. Results showed that superpredation: (1) is a widespread interaction in large raptors, but it can {{vary according to the}} top predator species; (2) is not an important energetic resource for large raptors, but rather seems mostly related to <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> when the main prey decreases; (3) is spatially clustered reflecting habitat heterogeneity, but shows no temporal or large-scale spatial trends; and (4) it is associated with lower breeding success of the top predator species. These findings support the food stress hypothesis as the main driving force behind increases in superpredation and IGP in raptors, with the decrease in breeding performance as a side effect. Superpredation by large raptors deserves future research to understand its effects on mesopredators, because on one hand it might contribute to promote biodiversity, while on the other hand, it can sometimes represent an additional risk for small populations of endangered mesopredators...|$|E

FAO projections indicate that the per capita consumption of rice will level off by 2015 and start to decline in the 2030 time period (FAO, 2003). Absolute declines in per capita rice consumption because of <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> in Asia are not yet widespread, but patterns established by the more advanced rice-eating countries (Japan, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan Province of China) have started appearing in other developing countries, such as China and Thailand.

Methodology and Principal Findings: Using 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and terminal restriction fragment (tRF) length polymorphism analyses of these genes, we examined the bacterial communities within the guts of facultatively granivorous, adult Harpalus pensylvanicus (Carabidae), fed one of five dietary treatments: 1) an untreated Field population, 2) Seeds with antibiotics (seeds were from Chenopodium album), 3) Seeds without antibiotics, 4) Prey with antibiotics (prey were Acheta domesticus eggs), and 5) Prey without antibiotics. The number of seeds and prey consumed by each beetle were recorded following treatment.

The FAO Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which was adopted in 1996 by approximately 150 countries, identified the improved conservation and use of NUS {{as one of its}} 20 main activities. Interest in NUS stems from a variety of factors, including their contribution to agricultural diversification and better use of land, their economic potential and the opportunities they provide for <b>diet</b> <b>diversification.</b> NUS are being often presented as new species though they have been used by local populations in traditional ways for many centuries. Their novelty is thus not related to their introduction to new areas but rather {{to the ways in which}} old and new uses are being readdressed to meet today’s needs. The International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) has been concerned to improve conservation and use of NUS, and has spearheaded, over the last few years, specific activities at national and international level for the better conservation and use of these species. Collaborative works on a number of NUS-oriented Networks have been supported together with the production of a series of monographs on selected NUS. IPGRI’s strategy for meeting the challenges of NUS promotion is based on the premise that th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two new, nearly {{completely}} articulated {{skeletons of}} Sapeornis chaoyangensis provide much {{new information about}} the anatomy of this basal avian, particularly in the skull, pectoral girdle, forelimb, and hind limb. This new material shows that the hand of Sapeornis, with a phalangeal formula of “ 2 – 3 – 2, ” was more derived than previously reconstructed. The skeleton of Sapeornis has several unique features, such as a distinctively elongated fenestra on the proximal end of the humerus, a robust furcula with a distinctive hypocleidum, and an elongated forelimb. Sapeornis exhibits a combination of derived and primitive features, including a short, robust non-strut-like coracoid and a fibula reaching the distal end of the tarsal joint (as in Archaeopteryx), a pygostyle, reduced manual digits, and a well-fused carpometacarpus (as in more advanced birds). These features further indicate the mosaic pattern in the early evolution of birds and confirm the basal position of Sapeornis near Archaeopteryx and Jeholornic in the phylogeny of early birds. The preservation of gastroliths {{in one of the}} new specimens also represents the first Chinese Mesozoic bird with such evidence, indicating a herbivorous feeding habit and providing further evidence for our understanding of the <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> in early avian evolution. Résumé: Deux nouveaux squelettes presque complètement articulés de Sapeornis chaoyangensis fournissent beaucoup de nouvelles informations à propos de l’anatomie de cet oiseau de base, surtout en ce qui concerne le crâne, la ceinture thoracique ainsi que les membres antérieurs et postérieurs.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the plant species eaten by kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) determines the diet quality, which impacts on kudu condition and mortality levels. The yearround diet {{composition of}} kudus in the Limpopo Province, a mopane (Colophospermum mopane) dominated area, was determined by faecal analysis. The most important dietary plant species were Colophospermum mopane, Grewia bicolor, Terminalia prunioides, Tinnea rhodesiana, Boscia albitrunca and Combretum apiculatum, with C. mopane comprising on average 39. 2 % of diet per month. Small amounts of herbs, grasses and seeds made up the remaining part of the diet. The contribution of C. mopane in the diet was negatively correlated with precipitation. Colophospermum mopane was consumed, irrespective of its high condensed tannin load (5. 2 – 9. 8 % DW) {{for the majority of}} the months. No seasonally significant differences were detected for modelled kudu diet crude protein, tannin or phenol concentrations. Colophospermum mopane showed significant seasonal differences with lowest values of protein, tannin and phenols in the late wet season. Surprisingly, crude protein concentrations were positively correlated with high levels of tannins and phenols for C. mopane. The diet of kudus comprised of significantly more species during the wet season compared to the dry season. <b>Diet</b> <b>diversification,</b> instead of protein maximization, seems a potential tool to satisfy protein requirements while reducing potential toxic effects associated with a high intake of secondary compounds. A significant positive correlation was therefore detected between the tannin concentration of C. mopane leaves and the number of plant species in the diet...|$|E
40|$|India and China are two similar {{developing}} countries with huge populations, {{rapid economic growth}} and limited natural resources, therefore facing the massive pressure of ensuring food security. In this paper, we will discuss the food security situations in these two countries by studying the historical changes of food supply-demand balance {{with the concept of}} agricultural land requirements for food (LRF) from 1963 – 2009. LRF of a country is a function of population, per capita consumption/diet, cropping yield and cropping intensity. We have attempted to discuss and compare our results in a framework which links consumption of different groups of food items to diet patterns; then, to the total land requirement for food in a scenario when population is growing rapidly and <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> and urbanization due to economic reform impose excessive pressure on food security of both countries. We also elaborate on the role of technology dissemination and critically analyze the achievements and drawbacks of government policies to ensure food self-sufficiency and food security of nations. Our results show that the total LRF increases approximately by 42 % and 40 %, whereas per capita LRF decreases significantly by about 48 % and 30 % from 1963 – 2009, for India and China, respectively. Furthermore, our studies reveal that population growth dominates most of the increase in total LRF for India; whereas diet pattern change induced by income growth drives the major increase in LRF for China. Therefore, sustainable management of agricultural land resource is an urgent need both for India and China as there will be demand for more food to meet the diet requirement for the entire population. We also demonstrate the role of India and China in future global food security programs and the challenges to implement the new land reform policies domestically...|$|E
40|$|Journal articleBackground. Orange-fleshed {{sweet potato}} (OFSP) is a {{promising}} biofortified crop for sub-Saharan Africa {{because it has}} high levels of provitamin A carotenoids, the formed vitamin A is bioavailable, and white-fleshed sweet potato is already widely grown. Objectives. To examine whether farmers will adopt varieties with a distinct visible trait, young children will eat OFSP in sufficient quantities to improve vitamin A intake, OFSP can serve as an entry point for promoting a more diversified diet, and lessons can be drawn to assure sustained adoption. Methods. The 2 -year quasi-experimental intervention study followed households and children (n = 741; mean age, 13 months at baseline) through two agricultural cycles in drought prone-areas of Mozambique. Results. OFSP is acceptable to farmers when introduced by using an integrated approach. In the second year, intervention children (n = 498) {{were more likely than}} control children (n = 243) to have consumed OFSP (54 % vs. 4 %), dark-green leaves (60 % vs. 46 %), or ripe papaya (65 % vs. 42 %) on 3 or more days in the previous week (p <. 001 for all comparisons). Their vitamin A intakes were nearly eight times higher than those of control children (median, 426 vs. 56 µg RAE [retinol activity equivalents], p <. 001). <b>Diet</b> <b>diversification</b> was limited by difficult agroecological conditions and low purchasing power. However, dietary diversity was higher among intervention than control children (32 % vs. 9 % consuming food from more than four groups; p <. 001). Conclusions. An integrated OFSP-based approach had a positive impact on the vitamin A intake of young children.

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} and income growth, urbanization, and globalization are {{leading to a}} dramatic shift of Asian diets away from staples and increasingly towards livestock and dairy products, vegetables and fruit, and fats and oils. While the diversification of diets away from the traditional dominance of rice with rising incomes is expected and observed, current food consumption patterns are showing signs of convergence towards a Western diet. Globalization and the consequent global interconnectedness of the urban middle class, {{is the driving force}} behind the convergence of diets. The rapid spread of global supermarket chains and fast food restaurants are reinforcing the above trends. The following six key stylised facts characterize the changes in food demand in Asia: i) reduced per capita consumption of rice; ii) increased consumption per capita of wheat and wheat based products; iii) increased diversity in the food groups consumed; iv) rise in high protein and energy dense diets; v) increased consumption of temperate zone products; and vi) the rising popularity of convenience food and beverages. As the demand profile changes with economic growth and globalisation, so the supply systems must adapt to accommodate this change. Asian agriculture is on an irreversible path leading away from its traditional preoccupation with cereal crop production, especially rice, towards a production system that is becoming increasingly commercialized and diversified. This paper addresses the opportunities and constraints in the transformation process. It discusses the prospects for the small farmer to share in the benefits from greater market integration. Finally, the paper identifies an agenda for science, technology and policy that will allow for a smoother transition to the emerging production and food supply system.

40|$|Concepts on {{malnutrition}} {{have evolved}} from {{an emphasis on}} protein deficiency through energy deficit, {{to the realization that}} food quality in general and an adequate supply of micronutrients in particular, is often more of a problem than food quantity. Throughout the developing world, micronutrient deficiency {{is one of the most}} important factors influencing human health, being directly responsible for conditions such as xeropthalmia, associated with vitamin A deficiency and anaemia, due to iron deficiency. In addition, micronutrient deficiency predisposes children to infection and retards recovery from common infections such as malaria, measles and diarrhoea. The groups most at risk from micronutrient deficiency are usually children and those for whom labour for food production is limited by ill health (HIV sufferers), advanced age or intense social commitments (single mothers, for example). There have been numerous health projects in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the developing world, to address micronutrient deficiency through the distribution of vitamin and mineral supplements, which usually have to be imported. An alternative (or complementary) approach is to promote the inclusion of high quality food crops in the farming system to enrich the diet with essential vitamins and minerals. This agricultural approach to the problem of micronutrient deficiency can provide sustainable solutions, which improve diet quality. An increase in the cultivation of high quality foods such as legumes, fruits and green vegetables, may be able to deliver a balanced diet to households, without necessarily requiring additional land and labour. Agricultural approaches to enhance dietary intake of vitamins and minerals have the additional advantage that they foster community self-reliance, they are sustainable in the absence of external funding, and, offer the opportunity for enhanced income by marketing surplus production. <b>Diet</b> <b>diversification</b> through better use of existing biodiversity offers an immediate means to address poor diet quality and can also include the use of presently available nutritionally enhanced crops, such as orange-fleshed sweet potato...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} selected micronutrients and anaemia among school-aged children living in Libo Kemkem and Fogera (Amhara State, Ethiopia), assessing differences by socio-demographic characteristics, health status and dietary habits. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out during May-December 2009. Socio-demographic characteristics, health status and dietary habits were collected. Biomarkers were determined for 764 children. Bivariate and multivariable statistical methods were employed to assess micronutrient deficiencies (MD), anaemia, and their association with different factors. RESULTS: More than {{two thirds of the}} school-aged children (79. 5 %) had at least one MD and 40. 5 % had two or more coexisting micronutrient deficiencies. The most prevalent deficiencies were of zinc (12. 5 %), folate (13. 9 %), vit A (29. 3 %) and vit D (49 %). Anaemia occurred in 30. 9 % of the children. Children living in rural areas {{were more likely to have}} vit D insufficiency [OR: 5. 9 (3. 7 - 9. 5) ] but less likely to have folate deficiency [OR: 0. 2 (0. 1 - 0. 4) ] and anaemia [OR: 0. 58 (0. 35 - 0. 97) ]. Splenomegaly was positively associated with folate deficiency and anaemia [OR: 2. 77 (1. 19 - 6. 48) and 4. 91 (2. 47 - 9. 75) ]. Meat and fish consumption were inversely correlated with zinc and ferritin deficiencies [OR: 0. 2 (0. 1 - 0. 8) and 0. 2 (0. 1 - 0. 9) ], while oil consumption showed a negative association with anaemia and deficiencies of folate and vitamin A [0. 58 (0. 3 - 0. 9), OR: 0. 5 (0. 3 - 0. 9) and 0. 6 (0. 4 - 0. 9) ]. Serum ferritin levels were inversely correlated to the presence of anaemia (p< 0. 005). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency and a moderate prevalence of zinc and folate deficiencies in school-aged children in this area. The inverse association of anaemia and serum ferritin levels may be due to the presence of infectious diseases in the area.

40|$|In this thesis, I use {{experimental}} and quasi-experimental data from 25 villages {{and a total}} of 1, 105 farmers from eastern DRC to investigate the relationship among agricultural training, the adoption of agricultural technologies, crop productivity, and household food insecurity and dietary diversity. I present evidence that contributes to narrow the gap in the literature on the role of input subsidies fostering small-scale farmers&# 39; uptake of productivity-enhancing technologies, how farmer field school and farmer-to-farmer trainings affect the adoption of agricultural technologies, how F 2 F training may reduce the costs of FFS implementation, how adoption materializes on yields of food crops, and how training through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies impacts household food insecurity and the <b>diet</b> <b>diversification</b> of target households. As a complement to econometric evidence and {{in order to understand the}} main findings, I also discuss behavioral features and farmer driven initiatives which somehow condition these impacts. Throughout the four main chapters, I identify practical implications that are highly important for the design and implementation of new programs and policies aimed to address agricultural productivity issues and reduce household food insecurity. In Chapter 1 I develop a general introduction to the research which discusses the evolution of agricultural extension in the last few decades, and describe FFS and F 2 F training methodologies. Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of the project intervention, technologies promoted, research settings and the data collection process. In Chapter 3, I report the results of an experimental study that analyses the impact of one-shot input starter packs on the adoption of productivity-enhancing complementary practices, which have the potential to maximize the impact of starter pack inputs. Additionally, I assess the levels of persistence on farmers’ use of improved crop seeds which are included in the starter packs. Overall, I find no evidence of starter packs’ impact on small-scale farmers’ adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies. Similarly, the levels of persistence regarding the use of seeds following the delivery of starter packs were not significant. These results are consistent with studies that have found minimal or no persistence on the use of inputs following the provision of subsidies, including Duflo, Kremer et al. (2011). The limited impact that starter packs had on yields in the first year may logically explain that farmers refrained from using improved seeds subsequently because the inputs are not economically attractive. Chapter 4 studies the effectiveness of knowledge transmission from farmers trained in FFS through farmer-to-farmer training (F 2 F), which could potentially result in lower extension costs and higher impacts. I find that FFS training has a higher impact than F 2 F training in the first period, but the magnitude of the treatment effect in the second period is not statistically different between the two training methods. I argue that the dissemination of technologies promoted in FFS groups can well be formalized through farmer-to-farmer deliberate training attached to the FFS approach. Given the low costs of F 2 F training compared to FFS, the introduction of F 2 F training may substantially alleviate a major constraint to the large-scale introduction of FFS as a training method, its high costs. In Chapter 5, I study the impact of farmer’s participation in FFS and F 2 F training on small-scale agricultural productivity. A multi-crop yield-index and the yields of cassava were used as impact indicators. The results indicate that both FFS and F 2 F trainings contribute to a significant increase in farmers’ yields, especially in the second period when the magnitude of the effect substantially increased. We also learned that the effect size does not differ between the two training approaches in neither period, suggesting that F 2 F communications are a suitable alternative or complement to FFS training. While the chapter was unable to confirm if training materializes in higher yields through technology adoption, I argue that in the context of the sample the adoption of productivity-enhancing practices and inputs are likely the most important impact mechanism. I also study the relationship between agricultural training, the adoption of improved technologies and household food insecurity. I find that farmers’ participation in agricultural trainings has a positive effect, through the adoption of improved technologies, on improvements in household dietary diversity (HDDS). Nonetheless, the impact on household access to food (HFIAS) is less evident. These results suggest that FFS/F 2 F training can well reduce household food insecurity, which is mostly achieved through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies. Yet, there are farm and household specific factors which constrain how training impacts technology adoption and how adoption affect household food insecurity and <b>diet</b> <b>diversification.</b> In Chapter 7, I synthesize the results of the four main chapters and articulate the sequence of results from training to adoption to productivity to food security...|$|E
