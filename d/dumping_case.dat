40|$|Using data taken {{directly}} from the ITC's <b>dumping</b> <b>case</b> studies, the paper uses standard logit techniques to empirically investigate a US industry's decision to initiate a <b>dumping</b> <b>case</b> against its foreign competitors. A major finding is that a domestic industry {{is more likely to}} initiate a <b>dumping</b> <b>case</b> if there has been a recent surge in imports from that country, and if that country's imports represent a significant share of the US market. In addition, it is observed that depressed or declining industries tend to initiate cases with greater frequency. Support is found for the view that US manufacturers may initiate dumping cases in order to deter new entrants to US markets or to penalize such entry.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and develops}} certain observable indices {{of the nature}} and effects of dumping and antidumping policy. The object is to analyze each antidumping procedure introduced by the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) for the 1998 – 2001 period. Using conservative criteria, we find that 68. 2 % of the antidumping procedures introduced by the EU appear to have a questionable economic foundation, meaning that the identified factors suggest that the conduct challenged is unlikely to have any significantly anticompetitive effect. We similarly find a questionable economic foundation in 76 % of the analyzed cases in the US. The recommendation that we propose is that it may be appropriate to modify the antidumping law to take into account at a preliminary stage the factors that may indicate {{the presence or absence of}} potential anticompetitive effects.

40|$|On March 11, 1996, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Florida Bell Pepper Growers Exchange, the Florida Farm Bureau, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services {{and other}} U. S. tomato {{producers}} filed a petition with the International Trade Commission (ITC) for economic {{relief from the}} effects of increased tomato imports from Mexico under Section 202 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974. A second petition was filed with the U. S. Department of Commerce under Section 733 (a) of the U. S. Tariff Act of 1930, charging that Mexican tomatoes were being dumped on the U. S. market at prices less than fair market value (LTFV) and were the cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Florida growers blame their recent loss of market share and depressed prices during the 1995 - 96 winter season on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The reduction in trade barriers due to NAFTA allegedly resulted in a flood of Mexican tomato imports, which have depressed domestic prices and resulted in declining profits, employment and investments. These allegations constitute the legal criteria for a petition seeking economic relief from imports sold at less than fair market value. The ITC investigated the first petition and rejected it on July 2, 1996. The antidumping petition continued during the summer and fall, 1996, until trade negotiations resulted in a compromise agreement that suspended the investigation. On October 11, 1996, the U. S. and Mexican tomato growers reached an agreement suspending the <b>dumping</b> <b>case</b> and establishing a minimum import price for fresh tomatoes at $ 0. 2068 per pound ($ 0. 45 /kg) or $ 5. 17 per 25 -pound box. The price floor appeared low enough to allow for competitive improvements and disposal of temporary oversupplies in the market. Thus the wholesale price of tomatoes from the two regions would be approximately equivalent, restoring a "level playing field. "International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

Among the significant dispute settlement provisions, the FTA establishes binding binational panel review to resolve disputes concerning final antidumping and countervailing duty 4 orders from the administrative agencies of either country. The binding procedure will expire in seven years, during which time the internal laws of both countries will be harmonized to eliminate further need for the dispute resolution mechanism. The 2 ̆ 2 unique dispute resolution mechanism,” while critical to Canada 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of the FTA to ensure impartiality, stirs controversy in the United States. In addition to criticism of the binational panel provisions on political and economic grounds (reflecting concealed protectionism and internal tensions between the Executive, the Congress, and the courts), the Congress considered and rejected speculation that these provisions may be constitutionally infirm. Though congressional approval has quelled the policy controversy, hidden in the constitutional question is distrust over a perceived protectionist bias of the International Trade Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in their present judicial review function. Some of the fears of the Canadians and United States free traders are well-known in the subsidy and <b>dumping</b> <b>cases,</b> and judicial review of agency orders in the United States has gone both ways. Nonetheless, for as much disinterestedness and impartiality in reviewing orders as possible under the FTA. including as much insulation as possible from unilateral statutory changes, the Canadians insisted and the United States negotiators agreed to Party election to have binding review of these orders in a binational forum outside domestic judicial control. This article addresses those constitutional issues relating to the binding binational panel review provisions that may surface under the FTA. We wish to appraise these issues, to appraise ways in which potential difficulties have been resolved by the implementing statute, and to determine whether any other constitutional questions might properly be considered by federal courts in the United States...|$|R

40|$|While {{conventional}} wisdom is that dumping is selling at a loss, {{this is not necessarily}} the <b>case.</b> <b>Dumping</b> is exporting a product at a lower price than that charged on the home market (the dumping margin (see Glossary)). As a result, a company may be making money on the export of a product, but if it is making a greater profit on its home market than it is making on a foreign market, it may be dumping. A company may engage in dumping as part of a deliberate strategy (for instance, it may be protected from competition on its home market and may use this advantage to push competitors out of other markets). Alternatively, price differences between domestic and imported products may be explained by different demand curves or other normal business behaviour. Either way, dumping can affect competition in markets that import these lower priced products, and has the potential to eliminate local competitors...|$|R
