Thresholds for evoked vocal responses to synthetic advertisement calls played back at increasing intensity averaged 43 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL</b> (range 31 – 52 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL),</b> measured at the subjects’ position. Number of pulses increased with stimulus intensities, reaching a plateau at about 18 – 39 dB above threshold and decreased at higher intensities. Latency to call followed inverse trends relative to number of pulses. Neural audiograms yielded an average best threshold in the high frequency range of 46. 6 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL</b> (range 41 – 51 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL)</b> and a center frequency of 1. 9 kHz (range 1. 7 – 2. 6 kHz).

(2005, Animal Behaviour, 70, 639 e 651) found that the leptodactylid frog Eupsophus calcaratus from the temperate austral forest increases its vocal output in the presence of natural noises and a band-pass noise overlapping the main spectral components of its advertisement call. We subjected the sympatric species E. emiliopugini to similar experimental conditions to assess its response to noise exposure. Male E. emiliopugini showed no increase in vocal activity in the presence of moderate noise levels (67 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL,</b> fast weighting) and decreased their vocal output in the presence of band-pass noise of increasing intensity (49 e 85 <b>dB</b> RMS <b>SPL,</b> fast weighting). However, E. emiliopugini, like E. calcaratus, increased the amplitude of their vocal responses in these circumstances. The vocal responses of males of E. emiliopugini under noise exposure and their contrast with the congeneric species unveil different strategies in confronting interference, whose origins and adaptive significance warrant further study.

50|$|Distortion {{measurements}} on loudspeakers {{can only go}} as low as the distortion of the measurement microphone itself of course, at the level tested. The microphone should ideally have a clipping level of 120 to 140 <b>dB</b> <b>SPL</b> if high-level distortion is to be measured. A typical top-end speaker, driven by a typical 100watt power amplifier, cannot produce peak levels much above 105 <b>dB</b> <b>SPL</b> at 1 m (which translates roughly to 105 dB at listening position {{from a pair of}} speakers in a typical listening room). Achieving truly realistic reproduction requires speakers capable of much higher levels than this, ideally around 130 <b>dB</b> <b>SPL.</b> Even though the level of live music measured on a (slow responding and rms reading) sound level meter might be in the region of 100 <b>dB</b> <b>SPL,</b> programme level peaks on percussion will far exceed this. Most speakers give around 3% distortion measured 468-weighted 'distortion residue' reducing slightly at low levels. Electrostatic speakers can have lower harmonic distortion, but suffer higher intermodulation distortion. 3% distortion residue corresponds to 1 or 2% Total harmonic distortion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the feasibility of a new kind of implantable hearing device based on a cerebrospinal fluid hydroacoustic pathway by which sound waves are conducted from the dura mater to the inner ear by cerebrospinal fluid. In this prospective animal study, a piezoelectric bimorph was implanted into 2 guinea pigs and I dog between the skull bone and the dura at the parietal area. The bimorph was connected transdermally by wires to a click generator. The auditory brain stem response was recorded after stimulation of the piezoelectric device by the click generator. In the 3 animals, the auditory brain stem response could be recorded in response to a stimulus intensity of 135 dB peak equivalent (pe) sound pressure level (SPL; instrument setting), corresponding to 3. 8 V activating the device. The auditory brain stem response disappeared during white noise masking, proving that the origin of the response was in the inner ear. The threshold was 125 and 115 <b>dB</b> pe <b>SPL</b> in the 2 guinea pigs and 135 <b>dB</b> pe <b>SPL</b> in the dog (instrument setting). We conclude that transmission of sound waves by a cerebrospinal fluid hydroacoustic pathway to the inner ear is possible.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several teleost {{species have}} evolved {{anterior}} {{extensions of the}} swim bladder which come close to or directly contact the inner ears. A few comparative {{studies have shown that}} these morphological specializations may enhance hearing abilities. This study investigates the diversity of swim bladder morphology in four Asian and African cichlid species and analyzes how this diversity affects their hearing sensitivity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied swim bladder morphology by dissections and by making 3 D reconstructions from high-resolution microCT scans. The auditory sensitivity was determined in terms of sound pressure levels (SPL) and particle acceleration levels (PAL) using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique. The swim bladders in Hemichromis guttatus and Steatocranus tinanti lacked anterior extensions and the swim bladder was considerably small in the latter species. In contrast, Paratilapia polleni and especially Etroplus maculatus possessed anterior extensions bringing the swim bladder close to the inner ears. All species were able to detect frequencies up to 3 kHz (SPL) except S. tinanti which only responded to frequencies up to 0. 7 kHz. P. polleni and E. maculatus showed significantly higher auditory sensitivities at 0. 5 and 1 kHz than the two species lacking anterior swim bladder extensions. The highest auditory sensitivities were found in E. maculatus, which possessed the most intimate swim bladder-inner ear relationship (maximum sensitivity 66 dB re 1 µPa at 0. 5 kHz). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anterior swim bladder extensions seem to improve mean absolute auditory sensitivities by 21 - 42 <b>dB</b> (<b>SPLs)</b> and 21 - 36 dB (PALs) between 0. 5 and 1 kHz. Besides anterior extensions, the size of the swim bladder appears to be an important factor for extending the detectable frequency range (up to 3 kHz) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Belgium, {{music theory}} {{teachers}} teach theoretical aspects of rhythm, singing and other music-related skills (such as pitch accuracy or singing in harmony) outside the regular school setting. To date, their voice use {{and how it}} may be affected by background noise have hardly been studied. OBJECTIVES: 1) to determine the relationship between music theory teachers’ vocal loading and background noise and 2) to examine if the daily number of vocal fold vibration cycles (vocal loading index, VLI) {{is reflected in the}} teachers’ auto-evaluation of their voice. METHODS: A VoxLog voice dosimeter (Sonvox) was used to monitor 13 music theory teachers for one 6 -day workweek from the early morning until late evening. Parameters analysed were fundamental frequency (F 0, Hz), voice sound pressure level (<b>SPL,</b> <b>dB),</b> time dose (%), noise <b>SPL</b> (<b>dB),</b> and VLI. At the end of each monitoring day, subjects evaluated their voice quality, vocal fatigue, and amount of speaking and singing voice used by means of a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed positive correlations between noise SPL and F 0, voice SPL and time dose. Correlations were also found between VLI and auto-evaluation data: a rise in VLI accompanied a decrease in self-perceived voice quality, an increase in vocal fatigue and an increase in the perceived amount of singing and speaking voice used. CONCLUSION: Three conclusions were drawn from the results. Firstly, vocal loading measured in music theory teachers is connected to the background noise level. Secondly, a great number of vibration cycles is associated with a self-reported increase in vocal fatigue and a lower general voice quality {{at the end of the}} day. Finally, correlations between the number of vibration cycles and the self-reported amount of voice use suggest that visual analogue scales are a reliable method to evaluate daily voice use.

This study reports normative data calculated on Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) obtained from twenty wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice at postnatal age between 21 and 45 days. Acoustic stimuli consisted of tone bursts at 8, 14, 20, 26, 32 kHz, and of clicks. Each stimulus was delivered in free field at stimulation intensity starting from a maximum of 100 <b>dB</b> peak equivalent <b>SPL</b> (<b>dB</b> peSPL) at decreasing steps of 10 dB with a repetition rate of 13 /s. Evoked responses were recorded by means of needle electrodes inserted subcutaneously. At high intensity stimulation five response waveforms, each consisting of a positive peak and a subsequent negative valley, were identified within 7 ms, and were labelled with sequential capital Roman numerals from I to V. Peak IV was the most robust and stable at low intensities for both tone burst and click stimuli, therefore it has been utilized to estimate hearing thresholds. Both latencies and amplitudes of ABR peaks showed good reproducibility with acceptable standard deviations. Mean wave IV thresholds as measured across all animals ranged from a maximum of 23 dB peSPL for clicks to a minimum of 7 dB peSPL for 20 kHz-tone burst stimuli. Statistical analysis of the distribution of latencies and amplitudes of peaks from I to V performed for each stimulus type, yielded a normative data set which was utilized to obtain the most consistent fitting-curve model. This could serve as a reference for further studies on murine models of hearing loss...|$|R
