25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had made <b>enough</b> <b>already.</b> With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon we ended up just about square.|$|E
2500|$|The judge William Keogh, before passing {{sentence}} {{asked him}} if he had any further remarks to make in reference to his case. Mr. Kickham briefly replied: [...] "I believe, my lords, I have said <b>enough</b> <b>already.</b> I will only add that I am convicted for doing nothing but my duty. I have endeavoured to serve Ireland, and now I am prepared to suffer for Ireland." [...] Then the judge with many expressions of sympathy for the prisoner, and many compliments in reference to his intellectual attainments, sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for fourteen years.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1951, she was fed up; two marriages had failed, and she was typecast in Hollywood as a sex symbol. As {{a result of her}} disillusionment with Hollywood and not liking what it did with people, she walked out on Hollywood, took her three children, and headed to New York to restart her career. Lake wanted to leave her sexy image behind, and New York offered the {{opportunity}} to work in theater and the new medium, television."They said, 'She'll be back in a couple of months'", recalled Lake. [...] "Well I never returned. Enough was <b>enough</b> <b>already.</b> Did I want {{to be one of the}} walking dead or a real person?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{generalization}} {{from that}} river {{to the land}} as a whole followed soon <b>enough.</b> <b>Already</b> Duarte Pacheco Pereira, in his Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis (c. 1506-09), refers to the entire coast as the terra do Brasil daleem do mar Ociano ("land of Brazil beyond the Ocean sea"). The term {{is also found in}} a letter, dated April 1, 1512, from Afonso de Albuquerque to the king, referring to a map of a Javanese pilot, which contained a depiction of the [...] "terra do brasyll". The 1516 map of Martin Waldseemüller drops his earlier America designation and refers to it now as Brasilia sive Terra Papagalli ("Brasilia, or the Land of Parrots"). The first [...] "official" [...] use of the term appears in 1516, when King Manuel I of Portugal invested the Portuguese captain Cristóvão Jacques as governador das partes do Brasil ("governor of the parts of Brazil"), and again in 1530, when King John III designated Martim Afonso de Sousa as captain of the armada [...] "which I send to the land of Brazil" ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to continue to}} Big Bethel without knowledge of the layout or strength of the Confederate positions, Peirce sent Duryee's 5th New York Infantry out first. Captain Kilpatrick along with Captain Charles G. Bartlett and skirmishers were sent forward to scout the Confederate position. They returned to {{the main body of}} the Union force and, after observation and talking to a black man and a local woman as well, told the officers in command that the Confederates had between 3,000 and 5,000 men and 30 pieces of artillery. They actually had about 1,4001,500 men and 5 artillery pieces, but Kilpatrick accurately reported that their position was well fortified. If the Union forces had not done <b>enough</b> <b>already</b> to give up their plan and position, Kilpatrick gave notice of the arrival of the Union force at Big Bethel by shooting at Confederate scouts and pickets. As the Union force came up to the field, they could not see the Confederates behind their fortifications but the Confederates also did not have a good view of the Union force because of the shade from the woods behind the field on the right and small buildings on the left. However, they could see the bayonets and flag of a Union force about [...] to the left. Major Randolph, commanding the Howitzer Battalion, fired a shot at this column which ricocheted through the Union line and killed a soldier standing next to Colonel Bendix.|$|E

6000|$|When Mrs. Witham was herself {{again she}} almost assailed the Doctor with angry {{questions}} as to {{what he meant by}} putting such horrible ideas into the poor young man's mind. 'He has quite <b>enough</b> there <b>already</b> to upset him,' she added. Dr. Thornhill replied: ...|$|R

When asked {{about the nature of}} the explosives, he said {{forensic}} experts were already examining the blasts sites. In regards to more paramilitary forces, saying there were <b>already</b> <b>enough</b> forces <b>already</b> deployed, he added: [...] "We will retain them for some more time and probably not deploy them on poll duties (in six states)." [...] A high-level team consisting of senior Home Ministry officials also visited Assam to make an on-the-spot assessment of the situation arising out blasts.|$|R
