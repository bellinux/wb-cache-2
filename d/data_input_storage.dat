The problem for this study was to develop and test a comprehensive list of teacher behavior descriptors to be used as a resource in interpreting holistic data capture during a classroom observation and to develop a means for encoding all necessary data describing salient teachers 2 ̆ 7 and students 2 ̆ 7 classroom behaviors in a format suitable for optical scanner input to a microcomputer;This study had an experimental group of 57 and a control group of 58. Subjects were located in three different training sites (i. e., Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Kansas). The experimental group received time to review the training manual and practice at least two trial exercises of observing classroom simulation videotapes, script taping, and recording data on the formative 22 -item computer evaluation form. The control group received time to read 2 ̆ 2 placebo 2 ̆ 2 material and also view the same classroom simulation videotape, script tape, and devise their own means of recording data. Finally, both groups completed a computerized summative evaluation form consisting of ten items. This summative instrument was developed by selecting the most appropriate items directly from the formative instrument. The scores from both groups were compared with those of the 2 ̆ 2 expert jury 2 ̆ 7 s. 2 ̆ 2 This Iowa State University jury consisted of a team of individuals knowledgeable in effective teaching research;The experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group. The control group had a mean score of 4. 38, while the experimental group had a mean score of 7. 00. The difference was significant at the. 01 level;This research supports the importance of a training manual (containing both definitions and examples) to support a quality instrument for interpreting classroom data capture. At the conclusion of each training session, participants were provided with the opportunity to verbally respond concerning the format and scope of the instrument.

40|$|Introduction: LIS is {{a system}} {{developed}} {{for the purpose of}} collecting, processing, storing, and retrieving the data created in laboratory context. Accordingly, this research intends to evaluate the performance of the LIS based on the standards of the ‎American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the educational and private hospitals situated in the city of Isfahan. Method: This study is applied and descriptive-analytical in nature. The data were collected using a self-designed checklist prepared on the basis of standards of the ANSI including LIS- 8 A and LIS 2 -A, the validity and reliability of which were assessed and confirmed by the experts on laboratory and computer sciences as well as the department’s professors. The data were analyzed using SPSS 20 software using some statistical tests including T-test and ANOVA test so as to examine the informational content of the LISs based on three criteria, namely, <b>data</b> <b>input,</b> <b>data</b> <b>storage,</b> and processing and data output using the foregoing standard. In addition, LEVEN test was used for checking the equality of the variances. Results: Based on the findings of the study, the mean score for the three criteria (<b>data</b> <b>input,</b> <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> and processing, and data output) examined, referring to the standards, was found to be 27. 53. As a result, the private and educational hospitals under study did not show any difference in this regard.

40|$|Project Intrex is {{a series}} of {{long-range}} experiments in information transfer which is meant to have particular application to university library services in the next decade. The experimental work currently under active investigation incorporates several of the ideas generated during the summer of 1965 at the Intrex planning conference. 1 Essentially, this research falls into two major areas: 1) an augmented catalog, which stores and retrieves information about documents, and 2) text access, which stores and retrieves documents. 2 Work on the augmented catalog is divided among a <b>data</b> <b>input</b> group, a <b>storage</b> and retrieval group, and an output system (display console) group working together with the text access group.

40|$|The {{processing}} system {{used in the}} UCLA Biomedical Library is modest in size and still under development. Its origins date back to a batch mode serials control system begun in the mid- 1960 s. This was converted to an on-line system which currently has modules for check-in, updating and retrieval, claims, bindery preparation, and invoice information. Titles can be retrieved at the terminal by search of any word in the title, by subject heading, language, country of publication, and type of publication. The system is adaptable to network use and at present is shared with one other library. To the serials system has been added a computer-assisted cataloging and card production system.

40|$|Automated {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used to count motorized vehicles, but are not frequently used to count pedestrians. This is because the automated technologies available to count pedestrians are not very developed, and their effectiveness has not been widely researched. Moreover, most automated methods are used primarily {{for the purpose of}} detecting, rather than counting, pedestrians (Dharmaraju et al., 2001; Noyce and Dharmaraju, 2002; Noyce et al., 2006). Automated pedestrian counting technologies are attractive because they have the potential to reduce the labor costs associated with manual methods, and to record pedestrian activity {{for long periods of time}} that are currently difficult to capture through traditional methods. <b>Data</b> <b>input</b> and <b>storage</b> may also be less time consuming than with manual methods. On the other hand, the capital costs of automated equipment may be high; specialized training may be required to operate it; and automated devices are generally not capable of collecting information on pedestrian characteristics and behavior. For these reasons, automated devices are not appropriate for all pedestrian data collection efforts. The choice between which method is more appropriate to collect pedestrian data must be based on the accuracy level desired, budget constraints, and data needs specifications. Automated Counting Technologies Much of the research on automated pedestrian tracking devices has focused on pedestrian detection, not pedestrian counting. Extensive reviews of pedestrian detection technologies were conducted by Noyce and Dharmaraju (2002) and by Chan et al. (2006). Technologies include piezoelectric sensors, acoustic, active and passive infrared, ultrasonic sensors, microwave radar, laser scanners, video imaging (computer vision). Of the technologies listed above, those most adaptable to the purpose of pedestrian counting are: infra-red beam counters; passive infrared counters; piezoelectric pads; laser scanners; and computer vision technology. None of these devices are widely used for the purpose of counting pedestrians outdoors, but all have some potential to be adapted for that purpose. This report describes each of these technologies in detail, and discusses some of the technical strengths and weaknesses of each method. It is important to be aware that technical limitations are only one consideration among many when choosing an appropriate counting device. The device “packaging,” such as the method and location of installation may be equally important. For example, the location and accessibility of the device may create liability issues or promote vandalism...|$|R

The EP 16 VC provides an EN input which is synchronized with the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> (D) signal {{in a way that}} provides glitchless gating of the QHG and QHG outputs. When the EN signal is LOW, the input is passed to the outputs and the data output equals the <b>data</b> <b>input.</b> When the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> is HIGH and EN goes HIGH, it will force the QHG LOW and the QHG HIGH on the next negative transition of the <b>data</b> <b>input.</b> If the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> is LOW when the EN goes HIGH, the next data transition to a HIGH is ignored and QHG remains LOW and QHG remains HIGH. The next positive transition of the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> is not passed on to the data outputs under these conditions. The QHG and QHG outputs remain in their disabled state as long as the EN input is held HIGH. The EN input has no influence on the Q output and the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> is passed on (inverted) to this output whether EN is HIGH or LOW.
