The ordinary annual income of GKS is currently around 215,000 Swiss Francs (interest <b>income</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> and rental income) and covers just the personnel costs of GKS (90 full-time positions; Monastery Museum St. Georgen: 140 full-time positions). Extraordinary income achieved the GKS only exceptionally. New acquisitions occur only sporadically and with very limited resources given by the current financial situation. Thus, the foundation's purpose in the future, requires a financial leeway. The Federal Office of Culture examined ways to expand this maneuver along with the Federal Finance Administration on 1 January 2009. In {{the center of the}} considerations ware revenue-side measures to expand the capital base, new opportunities for wealth management as well as a review of the administrative tasks of GKS. In November 2011 the Federal Government relieved the foundation by bearing all costs of the management of the collection, as well as the foundation's secretariat.|$|E
