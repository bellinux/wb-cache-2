40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} of two {{experimental}} studies, 312 students were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 8 conditions, where agents differed by ethnicity (Black, White), <b>gender</b> (<b>male,</b> <b>female),</b> and image (realistic, cartoon), yet had identical messages and computer-generated voice. In the second study, 229 students were randomly assigned to one of 12 conditions where agents represented different instructional roles (expert, motivator, and mentor), also differing by ethnicity (Black, White), and <b>gender</b> (<b>male,</b> <b>female).</b> Overall, it was found that students had greater transfer of learning when the agents had more realistic images and when agents in the “expert ” role were represented non-traditionally (as Black versus White). Results also generally confirmed prior research where agents perceived as less intelligent lead to significantly improved self-efficacy. The presence of motivational messages, as employed through the motivator and mentor agent roles, led to enhanced learner self-regulation and self-efficacy. Results are discussed with respect to social cognitive theory. ...|$|E

The present study explored the effects of habitat, residency, and gender on the opinions of people regarding human-monkey conflict in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India. For this purpose an opinion survey of 400 participants was conducted on: (a) the intensity of man-monkey conflict, and (b) measures taken to resolve this conflict. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of habitat (temple, bazaar), residency (resident, non-resident), and <b>gender</b> (<b>male,</b> <b>female)</b> was employed. The residents of Shimla perceived more man-monkey conflict and therefore felt greater need for its effective resolution, than the non-residents.

Results — Differences were found in the 8 CAEQ factors (3 negative and 5 positive factors). Regular drinkers had lower negative consequences and higher positive perception expectancies than nondrinkers or occasional drinkers. Nondrinkers had higher harm to person/reputation expectancies than occasional or regular drinkers. Occasional drinkers had higher beneficial/moderation and lower harm to person/reputation expectancies than nondrinkers. Boys had higher positive perception expectancies than girls. Conclusion — Expectancies are associated with Chinese adolescents’ drinking.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 58 - 60) Past {{research has}} indicated that attributing outcome to internal factors (e. g. ability and effort) results in greater affect than attributing outcome to external elements (e. g. luck and task difficulty). Further, attribution research has found that ascribing outcome to stable factors (e. g. ability) results in lesser expectancy change than ascribing outcomes to unstable factors (e. g. luck and effort). Previous investigations have also found that females generally attribute to external and unstable factors more than males. This study attempted to determine if these differences between high school males and females still exist and if the degree of athletic involvement affects the attributions. High school age subjects (N = 108) completed five questionnaires each to determine how they attributed outcome following competition in a badminton match.
