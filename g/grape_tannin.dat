40|$|Nisin, a {{bactericidal}} polypeptide, has {{the potential}} to inhibit spoilage bacteria and control rnatolactic fermentation in wines. Nisin activity has previously been observed to remain stable in white wines but to decrease in red wines. This decrease is believed to be directly proportional to the concentration of polyphenolic compounds in the wines. Six polyphenolic components of grapes and wine (gallic acid, catechin, myricetin, quercetin, malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside, and crude <b>grape</b> <b>tannin)</b> were tested individually in a model wine system. Tannin resulted in the largest decrease in nisin activity. <b>Grape</b> <b>tannin</b> was further evaluated using a series of red wines ages for two, four, and six months before the addition of nisin. These studies showed a greater loss of nisin activity in the wine aged for six months that in the younger wines. Identical sets of wine, aged for two, four, and six months at either 4 'C or 23 'C before nisin was added, showed in each case that increased temperature resulted in an increased loss of nisin activity. This information may be valuable for winemakers who are considering the addition of fiisin to their wines to inhibit (or control) malolactic fermentation and the growth of spoilage lactic acid bacteria...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{stability}} of color is {{under the influence of the}} anthocyanins and tannins complexation. The traditional vinification technique relies on high temperature to liberate more anthocyanins and then a long maceration to extract tannins, to stabilize this color.

There are now tools to avoid a part of this instabilization : use of extraction enzymes which liberate <b>grape</b> <b>tannins</b> at the begining of the AF, use of certain yeast strains (production of polysaccharides), use of enological tannins in fermentation or just after, and microaeration.

40|$|Tannins {{are widely}} used in {{winemaking}} (classified by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine as clarification agents for protein stabilisation of musts and wines; COEI- 1 -TANINS: 2009) and for food and beverage production (recognised by the European Commission as flavourings and food ingredients; EC No 1334 / 2008, EU Regulation No. 872 / 12). Recently, {{for the first time}} relevant amount of the S-glutathionylated and S-cysteinylated precursors (GSH- 3 MH and Cys- 3 MH) of 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 MH) and 3 -mercaptohexyl acetate (3 MHA) have been identified in commercial grape tannins (Larcher et al., 2013). This evidence suggested new opportunities of technological use of these adjuvants for improving the exotic-fruit flavour profile of wine after fermentation. This hypothesis was experimentally investigated fermenting 17 Mueller Thurgau (MT) and 15 Sauvignon Blanc (SB) grapes according to 2 lab-scale distinct protocols: TAN and REF (respectively, with and without addition in the juice of a selected <b>grape</b> <b>tannin</b> particularly rich in GSH- 3 MH and Cys- 3 MH). Wines obtained from must added of <b>grape</b> <b>tannin</b> were significantly richer in the total content of the 2 thiols (expressed as sum of the molar concentrations; Tukey’s test, p < 0. 001) with median contents of 12. 6 nmol/L in TAN vs. 5. 16 nmol/L in REF for MT, and 11. 3 nmol/L vs. 2. 69 nmol/L for SB wines. The addition of precursors rich tannin produced wines with increased free thiols contents.

40|$|Today in {{the wine}} industry, oenological tannins are widely used to improve wine quality and prevent {{oxidation}} in wine aging. With the development of tannin products, new oenological tannins are developed with many specific functions, such as modifying antioxidant effect, colour stabilization and aroma modifications. The aim of this work is to investigate effects of pre-fermentative addition of oenological tannins on wine colour, anthocyanins, volatile compounds and sensorial properties. In this case, Syrah juice was extracted with classic flash thermovinification from fresh must in order to release more colour and tannins. Three types of oenological tannins, which are, respectively, derived from grape skin, seed (Vitis vinifera) and French oak (Quercus robur and Querrus petraea), were selected {{to carry out the}} experiments with seven treatments. Results indicated that tannin treatments significantly improved wine aroma complexity and sensorial properties. However, the concentration of some stable pigments such as Vitisin A, Vitisin A-Ac and Vitisin B was negatively affected by tannin additions. Nevertheless, by means of cluster analysis and principal component analysis, it was observed that higher alcohols were significantly promoted by <b>grape</b> seed <b>tannin</b> while most anthocyanins can be improved by addition of <b>grape</b> <b>tannins.</b> In conclusion, low amount of oenological <b>tannin</b> derived from <b>grape</b> seed is a promising method to be applied especially for young red wine making...|$|R
500|$|The tannic {{nature of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is an {{important}} winemaking consideration. As the must is exposed to prolonged periods of maceration, more tannins are extracted from the skin and will {{be present in the}} resulting wine. If winemakers choose not to shorten the period of maceration, in favor of maximizing color and flavor concentrations, there are some methods that they can use to soften tannin levels. A common method is oak aging, which exposes the wine to gradual levels of oxidation that can mellow the harsh <b>grape</b> <b>tannins</b> as well as introduce softer [...] "wood tannins". The choice of fining agents can also reduce tannins with gelatin and egg whites being positively-charged proteins that are naturally attracted to the negatively charged tannin molecules. These fining agents will bond with some of the tannins and be removed from the wine during filtration. One additional method is micro-oxygenation which mimics some of the gradual aeration that occurs with barrel aging, with the limited exposure to oxygen aiding in the polymerization of the tannins into larger molecules, which are perceived on the palate as being softer.|$|R
40|$|Condensed tannins {{derived from}} the grape berry {{contribute}} to the organoleptic properties of wine, in particular, astringency, as well as wine colour and aging stability. The contribution of different <b>grape</b> <b>tannin</b> structures to wine quality is not well understood. In particular, the measurement of tannin in grapes is not indicative of the amount and type of tannin extracted into wine, which {{makes it difficult to}} predict the impact on wine quality. Tannin extraction is thought to be influenced by interactions between tannins and cell walls of the grape berry. This study aimed to investigate the influence of <b>grape</b> <b>tannin</b> and cell wall composition on extraction of tannin into wine. Tannin distribution in terms of the distribution of polymer length or degree of polymerisation (DP), the concentration and subunit composition was determined in grape skin, seed and wine of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The polysaccharide composition and tannin binding capacity of cell walls and the amount of tannin extracted into wine at different grape maturity levels were also investigated. The extent of variation in Shiraz skin tannin distribution and cell wall structure and its tannin binding capacity was also investigated across a range of environmental conditions, including; Shiraz grapes grown with low, medium and high vigour canopies on Schwarzmann rootstock in Sunraysia, Australia; Shiraz grapes grown on Paulsen rootstock and own roots in Sunraysia, Australia and Shiraz grapes grown on Schwarzmann rootstock in the cooler growing region of Glenrowan, Australia. Determination of the tannin distribution in grape seeds, skin and wine provided a more thorough characterisation of tannin than has previously been reported. Grape seed tannin distribution was similar between varieties, whereas skin tannin distribution was influenced by varietal and environmental factors such as season and vine canopy vigour. The distribution of wine tannin was similar to grape skin with a DP less than 20. These results suggest that tannin above DP 20 are not extracted from grapes into wine during winemaking as they remain entrapped within the cell wall. A more thorough characterisation of the variation and structure of individual tannins below DP 20 would help to elucidate the tannins which are most important to wine quality. The polysaccharide composition of grape skin and whole berries (seeds removed) varied considerably, with differences also observed between Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. However, there was no consistent trend in polysaccharide composition associated with maturity for either variety. There was also no link between polysaccharide composition and the tannin binding capacity of cell walls. Characterisation of polysaccharide composition and tannin binding capacity did not provide any indication of the amount of tannin that might be extracted into wine. However, the amount of cell wall material measured in grapes correlated with the amount of tannin extracted into wine. The amount of tannin extracted into wine is most likely influenced by cell wall structure such as the thickness or density of the skin cell wall rather than the composition of tannins and polysaccharides. However, the ratio of anthocyanin to tannin may also {{play a critical role in}} the stability of tannin during extraction and wine aging. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Although {{they possess}} {{significant}} viticultural advantages, interspecific hybrid grapes (Vitis spp.) {{are reported to}} produce wine with lower condensed tannin (CT) concentrations than premium European wine varieties (V. vinifera). To elucidate the factors responsible, wines were produced from both red hybrid and vinifera cultivars under identical conditions in the Finger Lakes American Viticultural Area (AVA). Wine CT quantities varied across cultivars by up to 17 fold, while fruit CT differed by only up to 6 fold. CT in wines produced from V. vinifera grapes were {{an order of magnitude}} higher those in hybrid species (< 50 mg/L), but lower than average CT values reported for US West Coast wines, 255 vs 544 mg/L. Further experiments in which cell wall material was incubated with CT indicated that CT binding to cell wall material may be of greater importance than grape CT for explaining wine CT variation. Cell wall characterization revealed that protein in flesh and, to a lesser extent, pectin in skin cell walls were correlated with CT binding (r 2 = 0. 597 and r 2 = 0. 255, respectively). CT retention in finished wines was investigated by adding purified CT to native Vitis, hybrid and vinifera wines, leading to a precipitate with high nitrogen content. Proteomic analysis of the CT precipitate identified several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. Protein concentration in juices and red wines were quantitated by SDS-PAGE and were highest in native Vitis spp. (juice= 706 mg/L, wine= 296 mg/L), followed by interspecific hybrids (juice= 176 mg/L, wine= 92 mg/L) and Vitis vinifera (juice = 146 mg/L, wine= 16 mg/L). The fining of added CT by wine protein was modeled by the Freundlich equation (r 2 = 0. 605). To evaluate the role of grape-derived proteins in limiting CT extractability, V. vinifera and interspecific hybrids from both hot and cool climates were vinified under controlled conditions. Final CT concentration in wine was well modeled from initial <b>grape</b> <b>tannin</b> and juice protein concentrations using the Freundlich equation (r 2 = 0. 686).

In this study three condensed <b>tannins</b> (CT; quebracho, <b>grape</b> seed, green tea tannins) and four hydrolysable tannins (HT; tara, valonea, myrabolan, chestnut tannins) were evaluated with lucerne as a control substrate. CT and HT were characterised by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS). Tannins were added to the substrate at an effective concentration of 100 g/kg, either with or without polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000), and incubated for 72 h in pooled buffered rumen liquid from four lactating dairy cows. After inoculation, fermentation bottles were immediately connected to the APES to measure total cumulative gas production (GP). During the incubation, 11 gas samples were collected from each bottle at 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 15, 23, 30, 46, 52 and 72 h of incubation and analysed for CH 4. A modified Michaelis–Menten model was fitted to the CH 4 concentration patterns, and model estimates were used to calculate total cumulative CH 4 production (GPCH 4). GP and GPCH 4 curves were fitted using a modified monophasic Michaelis–Menten model. Addition of quebracho reduced (P= 0. 002) GP, whilst the other tannins did not affect GP. Addition of PEG increased GP for quebracho (P= 0. 003), valonea (P= 0. 058) and <b>grape</b> seed <b>tannins</b> (P= 0. 071), suggesting that these tannins either inhibited, or tended to inhibit, fermentation.

2500|$|In the Piedmont region, {{there is}} a long history of {{blending}} other grape varieties with Nebbiolo in order to add color and/or soften the <b>grape's</b> harsh <b>tannins.</b> In addition to use of red wine grapes such as Barbera, Croatina, and Bonarda Piemontese, white wine grapes such Arneis and Favorita also have a history of being blended with Nebbiolo. Historically, the association of blending Arneis with Nebbiolo was so strong that a common synonym of the former is Barolo Bianco or [...] "white Barolo". Today, the DOCG regulations for Barolo and Barbaresco call for the wine to be a 100% varietal of Nebbiolo. In 1998, producers of the Barbaresco region drafted a proposal to allow 10-15% of other grape varieties into the wine, but bad press by Italian wine critics lead to the rejection of that plan. While there is some speculation, from critics such as Oz Clarke, that Barbera or even Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon may be used to augment the color and flavors of Barolos by some producers, there is no explicit proof that this is occurring.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the sources of tannin in Pinot Noir <b>grapes.</b> <b>Tannins</b> {{contribute}} to colour stability and mouth-feel in wine. Some tannins are more beneficial {{to the quality of}} red wines than others. Achieving the correct balance is particularly difficult in Pinot Noir wines due to their unusual polyphenolic profile. In practical terms the thesis considered the following questions: How do we know from which berry tissues wine tannins are extracted? Are some tannins more desirable than others from a wine composition and quality viewpoint? How can we get more of the desirable tannins into Pinot noir wines? The study sought {{to gain a better understanding}} of the types of phenolic compounds that influence wine quality in terms of colour stability. Phenolic compounds are mainly derived from the skin and seed of the grapes. However the nature and proportion of phenolic compounds that are contributed by each tissue type, and ultimately become incorporated into the wine, was largely unknown prior to this study. The trials reported in this thesis used micro-vinification vessels ranging in size from 0. 25 to 20 L according to the detail of the experiment under investigation and the analyses applied. Maceration techniques that are practiced commercially were compared and showed that some of these are better suited to the production of Pinot Noir table wines than are others. To ascertain why this might be so, the research went on to examine the specific role of individual berry tissues in determining the outcome of the phenolic composition of the wine. The value of each tissue type was accentuated by providing a surplus or a deficit of each tissue type in the grape musts. The research examined the specific role of individual berry tissues in determining the outcome of the phenolic composition of the wine. A novel maceration technique (Accentuated Cut Edges or ACE) that improved the extraction of colour pigments from grape skin was examined in detail and strong correlations between the phenolic profile of the wine and its sensory attributes were identified. Finally, the spectral assessment of wine phenolic parameters from 15 individual experiments recognised six wavelengths by which phenolic components from skin and seed tissues could be distinguished. Using an existing rapid spectral assay, an index of phenolic quality was developed which has the potential to inform fermentation management strategies based on qualitative measures taken as the fermentation progresses...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 New {{research}} has identified flavonols {{as a class}} of phenolic compounds which can be manipulated by both vineyard and winery practices. These phenolic compounds are key quality components of wine, affecting sensory characteristics, wine color, and wine stability. Modification of the phenolic precursors in grapes occur during fermentation and aging by oxidation, hydrolysis and polymerization. The solubility of these compounds varies substantially and their interactions {{with each other and}} with the changing solvent properties of must and wine contribute to final phenolic composition of wine. Phenolics, in general, are known to be responsible for much of the astringency, bitterness and 'length' of flavor impression on the palate. However, little is known of the effect of specific phenolic compounds, such as quercetin, on the sensory characteristics of wine. In order to investigate the effect of various phenolics on the solubility of quercetin aglycone, concentrations of quercetin aglycone (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 mg L⁻¹) were added to a model wine system containing one of each of the following phenolic compounds: gallic acid, caffeic acid, (+) catechin, quercetin 3 -[subscript L]-rhamnoside, <b>grape</b> seed <b>tannin</b> and malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside. Gallic acid, caffeic acid, (+) catechin had no significant effect on the solubility of quercetin aglycone. The effect of quercetin 3 -[subscript L]-rhamnoside was dependant on concentration of added quercetin aglycone. The <b>grape</b> seed <b>tannin</b> and malvidin 3, 5 - diglucoside significantly increased the solubility of quercetin aglycone in all added quercetin concentrations, with the malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside resulting in the largest increase. Increasing concentrations of malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside resulted in increased levels of stable quercetin in solution. Samples with malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside and quercetin aglycone showed increases in absorbance (520 nm) of up to 20 %. The anthocyanin-flavonol interaction that resulted in an increase in 520 nm absorbance (copigmentation) also appears to be responsible for the increased solubility of the quercetin aglycone. These results suggest that anthocyanins in wine influence the wine's final flavonol composition. The technique of free choice profiling was used to characterize the sensory attributes of 3 concentrations of quercetin aglycone (5, 10, 20 ppm) when added to a model wine and a chardonnay. Based on the consensus area of model wine data, there was no significant separation of the samples. Analysis of the chardonnay data resulted in significant separation of the samples on PA 1 and PA 2. On PA 1, the control and 5 ppm samples were described as higher in overall flavor intensity, sourness and burn/hot and less watery. On PA 2, the samples with quercetin (5, 10 and 20 ppm) were described as higher in sweetness, bitterness, numbness and fruitiness while having a less intense overall aroma. In both studies, panelist replication patterns were extremely varied which was reflected in the high V[subscript within] across PA's, samples and panelists...|$|R
25|$|Grenache {{is often}} used as a {{blending}} component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the <b>grape's</b> naturally low <b>tannins</b> and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Bacteriocins are ribosomally {{synthesized}} antimicrobial peptides {{produced by}} bacteria and are active against other bacteria, {{either in the}} same species (narrow spectrum) or across genera (broad spectrum). The application of bacteriocins during the vinification process might help to prevent the production of undesired compounds by inhibiting the indigenous bacterial microflora and allowing malolactic fermentation to be conducted by a selected bacterial strain. Furthermore, the use of bacteriocins might allow reducing the total sulphur dioxide amount in wine. The {{purpose of this study}} was the selection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) belonging to the genera Oenococcus, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus with the ability to produce bacteriocins, with respective biological activity against undesired indigenous wine LAB and the capability to complete malolactic fermentation. The first objective of this study was the screening of LAB isolated from South African red wines for the production of bacteriocins. Only 27 strains out of 330 wine isolates, belonging to the species Lb. plantarum, Lb. paracasei, Lb. hilgardii and O. oeni, showed activity towards various wine-related and non wine-related indicator strains with the colony-overlay method. It is the first time that bacteriocin activity is reported in O. oeni. The second objective was the detection and identification of known structural bacteriocin genes of Lb. plantarum wine strains. Furthermore, the web server BAGEL was used to in silico analyse putative bacteriocin-encoding genes in the genome of O. oeni and primers were designed to amplify four possible bacteriocin-encoding genes. A PCR-based screening revealed the presence of the plantaricin encoding genes plnA, plnEF, plnJ and plnK in five selected Lb. plantarum strains. Moreover, PCR analysis rendered positive results with all four chosen putative bacteriocin-encoding genes in the eight tested O. oeni strains with antimicrobial activity. The latter genes of O. oeni were heterologously expressed in different Escherichia coli host strains, but no antimicrobial activity could be detected. The third objective of this study was the transformation and expression of the heterologous bacteriocin genes nisin A and pediocin PA- 1 in two selected Lb. plantarum strains. To enhance their antimicrobial activity a plasmid containing the nisin A gene was successfully cloned into the two strains. Indeed, an enhanced antimicrobial activity could be detected, but the transformed plasmid was not stable. The fourth objective in this project was the evaluation of bacteriocin production in liquid media. A co-culture experiment with a plantaricin producing Lb. plantarum strain and an Enterococcus faecalis strain as indicator was performed. A complete inhibition of cell growth of Ent. faecalis was observed within 72 hours. The last objective was the evaluation of the impacts of phenolic compounds on the activity of nisin and pediocin. The short term influence of two phenolic acids, two flavan- 3 -ols, <b>grape</b> <b>tannins</b> and oak tannins on the activity of nisin and pediocin PA- 1 was investigated. No influence on the activity was detected. Furthermore, synergistic effects on bacterial growth inhibition were observed. This study confirms the potential use of either bacteriocin additives or bacteriocin-producing LAB in order to control the bacterial microflora during the vinification process...|$|R

50|$|Châteauneuf-du-Pape {{wines are}} often high in alcohol, {{typically}} 13-15%, {{and must be}} minimum 12.5% under the appellation rules with no chaptalization allowed. Winemaking in the region tends to focus on balancing the high sugar levels in the <b>grape</b> with the <b>tannins,</b> and phenols that are common in red Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Following harvest, the grape clusters are rarely destemmed prior to fermentation. The fermentation temperatures are kept high, with the skins being frequently pumped over and punched down {{for the benefit of}} tannin levels and color extraction to achieve the characteristic dark Châteauneuf color. Beginning in the 1970s, market tendencies to prefer lighter, fruitier wines that can be drunk sooner have prompted some estates to experiment with carbonic maceration. Low yields are considered {{critical to the success of}} Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the principal grape varieties tending to make thin and bland wine when produced in higher quantities. The AOC requirements limit yields to 368 gallons per acre, which is nearly half the yields allowed in Bordeaux.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} the development and validation of an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method for the quantification of glutathione (GSH) in grape juice and in white wine after derivatisation with para-benzoquinone. The phenolic compounds catechin and caffeic acid that occur in white wine and have antioxidant effects, are also quantified in the same analysis. Catechin is the basic monomeric unit of <b>grape</b> and wine <b>tannins</b> and caffeic acid, when esterified with tartaric acid, plays a relevant role in Grape Reaction Product (GRP) formation. The analytical method proposed showed good linearity, repeatability and intermediate repeatability, as well as high recovery (> 85 %). It was applied for the quantification of GSH, catechin and caffeic acid in South African juices (12) and white wines (43). This novel method will have a large impact on the time and costs of the analyses for the wine industry through enabling rapid routine quantification of GSH, catechin and caffeic acid. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
