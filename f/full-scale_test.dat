500|$|There was {{government}} funding provided of $9,000 then {{with support from}} Senators Charles B. Farwell and Leland Stanford for a <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> experiment in northern Texas. There was to be completed a scientific analysis of the results. The man-made rain project was to take place {{near the town of}} Midland. The equipment involved in this test was 100 [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloons, dozens of kites six to twelve feet high, miles of copper wire, nitroglycerine, dynamite, and gunpowder. Myers provided all the balloons and the gases. Electric batteries and generators were also part of the on-site equipment. The design of the rain experiment project was to have explosions stir up particle aggregation. Myers' balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were the start of many such explosions that were to take place in the rain producing experiment. His balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were one part oxygen gas combined with two parts of hydrogen gas, which would make a huge explosion upon detonation. The side effect of this balloon explosion was that water was produced. This water would drop from the sky at some high altitude and the idea was that all of this action would stimulate the atmosphere to make rain. The balloons made by Myers for the government at his [...] "balloon farm" [...] would hold 500 to 5000 cubic feet of gas. Myers had complete charge of the government rain producing experiments for years.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Innovations in {{the field}} of {{prenatal}} diagnostic testing have {{led to the development of}} molecular tests that allow the rapid detection of specific genetic defects, such as Down syndrome. In addition, <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests</b> have been developed allowing the detection of many genetic disorders in a single test. Here we examined the attitudes of pregnant women in low risk pregnancies towards <b>full-scale</b> genetic <b>testing</b> and explored relationships between demographic characteristics and the level of interest. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 115 consecutive pregnant women. They completed the same structured questionnaire at two different time points, before counselling (T 1) and after 4 weeks (T 2), to assess a possible change of attitude. RESULTS: At T 1, 33 % of the respondents were in favour of <b>full-scale</b> <b>testing</b> of their unborn child, whereas at T 2, this percentage had dropped to 18 %. Except for educational level, no significant relationships were noted between the demographic variables and the wish to opt for <b>full-scale</b> <b>testing.</b> A low educational level was significantly related to the interest in <b>full-scale</b> <b>testing.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Low risk pregnant women expressed little interest in <b>full-scale</b> genetic <b>testing.</b> Educational level appeared to affect their views...|$|R
40|$|Load-carrying in two {{directions}} in lattice girder slab systems by complementing with lapped reinforcement across the joints at the construction site was studied. A detailing of load-carrying joints without any reinforcement across the cast joint was considered. The behaviour of the cast joint between the precast concrete and the in situ cast concrete is very important. Two different surface treatments were tested in two types of detail tests of the cast joint: one type in which the cast joint was loaded in shear, and one in tension. Furthermore, the detailing of the joint between two precast concrete panels was tested in bending in <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests.</b> The detail tests were used to calibrate a friction model of the cast joint, which was then used in finite-element analyses (FEAs) of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests.</b> In the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests,</b> the joints were strong enough to carry the applied load; thus, the failure mode was rupture of the reinforcement in all <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests,</b> and only one crack occurred—in the in situ cast concrete above the joint between the precast elements. However, the FEAs of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests</b> revealed that the detailing was sensitive to secondary cracking...|$|R

40|$|As {{the shallow}} and easily {{accessible}} {{oil and gas}} reservoirs are becoming depleted, {{the oil and gas}} industry has turned its attention towards the deeper and more remote reservoirs. The increased drilling depth, more complex well paths and tougher drilling conditions have pushed the limits of traditional drilling methods. Longer drill strings and increased amount of rotation hours have been found to wear out the well-supporting casing tubes at alarming rates. A measure to deal with these problems have for many years been to apply wear-resistant hardbanding materials on the drill string. Hardbanding materials were in the earlier years developed by trial and error, but now a days <b>full-scale</b> <b>testing</b> is most commonly used. However, <b>full-scale</b> <b>testing</b> is expensive, difficult to control and time consuming. The aim of this master thesis has thus been to design a lab-scale hardbanding/casing wear test setup, able to reproduce already known full-scale wear mechanisms with the use of close-to-field parameters. A lab-scale pin-on-ring setup were designed and proved able to reproduce many of the wear mechanisms from the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests.</b> Adhesive wear by galling, which is regarded as the most important wear mechanism with respect to wear rate, was found on many of the casing samples by the presence of work-hardened surface layers. Abrasive wear was most prominent at low contact pressures and at large sand quantities in the system. Fatigue wear, the third mechanism known from <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests,</b> was only present in the most brittle hardbanding samples. It was concluded that the test duration of 15 minutes was too short for this type of wear to evolve. </p...|$|R
