5|$|Higher {{education}} in the Faroe Islands is mainly undertaken by the University of the Faroe Islands, a public research university granting academic degrees. Individual higher education courses are offered by The Business School. Many <b>Faroese</b> pursue higher education out of the islands, mainly in Denmark; in August 2015 a report showed 1,345 <b>Faroese</b> students in Denmark, 904 in the Faroe Islands and 182 in other countries. Studni, the <b>Faroese</b> Student Grant Fund, provides {{student grants and loans}} to <b>Faroese</b> students, to study either in the Faroe Islands or abroad.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the New Scientist {{reported}} {{in an article}} that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by <b>Faroese</b> government that the consumption of Pilot Whale meat in the Faroes should stop {{as it had been}} proved to be too toxic. However, the <b>Faroese</b> government did not forbid people to eat Pilot Whale meat due to the contamination, but the advice from the Joensen and Weihe had an effect, it has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior <b>Faroese</b> health official.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is an Indo-European {{language}} {{belonging to}} the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, {{it belongs to the}} East Scandinavian languages together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of <b>Faroese,</b> Icelandic and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: Insular Scandinavian (<b>Faroese</b> and Icelandic), and Continental Scandinavian (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both <b>Faroese</b> and Icelandic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twelfth}} century {{education}} in the Faroe Islands {{was provided by the}} Catholic Church. The Church of Denmark took over education after the Protestant Reformation. Modern educational institutions started operating {{in the last quarter of}} the nineteenth century and developed throughout the twentieth century. The status of the <b>Faroese</b> language in education was a significant issue for decades, until it was accepted as a language of instruction in 1938. Initially education was administered and regulated by Denmark. In 1979 responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the <b>Faroese</b> authorities, a procedure which was completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|With the 19th century rise of {{nationalism}} and romanticism {{and the growing}} number of translations of the sagas, interest in the battle of Svolder increased outside of Iceland. Around 1830, the <b>Faroese</b> poet Jens Christian Djurhuus composed a ballad on the battle titled Ormurin langi, following Snorri's account. The ballad was well received and remains among the most popular and well-known <b>Faroese</b> ballads. In 2002, a heavy metal version by the band Týr gained some following abroad.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, the <b>Faroese</b> {{national}} broadcaster Kringvarp Føroya (KVF) {{has been}} attempting to gain EBU membership and thus participate independently in the Eurovision Song Contest. However KVF cannot obtain EBU membership {{due to the}} islands not being independent from the Kingdom of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Faroese</b> Nursing School was {{established}} in 1960 by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs; it traces its roots back in 1910 when nurses were trained in the hospital of Tórshavn. The University of the Faroe Islands, {{was established}} in 1965; Klaus H. Jacobsen, a Dane, was appointed as the first lecturer in 1970 to teach courses for the examen philosophicum, a prerequisite {{at the time to}} pursue higher education in Denmark. After Denmark abandoned the examen philosophicum in 1971, on the initiative of Jacobsen and Kjartan Hoydal the university accepted its first full-time science students in the autumn of 1972. Education in the Faroe Islands was administered by Denmark under the Home Rule Act, until in the late 1990s its administration was transferred to the <b>Faroese</b> government as a matter of local interest.|$|E
5|$|Ask and Embla {{have been}} the subject of a number of {{references}} and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of Sölvesborg, created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway, by Dagfin Werenskiold. In 2003, <b>Faroese</b> artist Anker Eli Petersen included a depiction of the couple in his series of Faroe Islands stamps.|$|E
5|$|Like Icelandic and <b>Faroese,</b> the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5|$|The IMF-led {{package of}} $4.6bn was finally agreed on 19 November, with the IMF loaning $2.1bn and another $2.5bn of loans and {{currency}} swaps from Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. In addition, Poland {{has offered to}} lend $200M and the Faroe Islands have offered $50M, about 3% of <b>Faroese</b> GDP. The Icelandic government reported that Russia offered to lend $500M, and Poland, $200M. The next day, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom announced a joint loan of $6.3bn (€5bn), related to the deposit insurance dispute.|$|E
5|$|The Public <b>Faroese</b> Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates from the Health School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the <b>Faroese</b> government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In <b>Faroese</b> folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Icelandic or <b>Faroese,</b> {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.|$|E
5|$|As {{porbeagles}} {{had become}} scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved {{west to the}} waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, {{they were joined by}} longline vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (smeriglio) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 tons per year, and <b>Faroese</b> catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. There is evidence that incidental artificial selection caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Manchester City {{once again}} {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through the Fair Play rankings. As City had to play the qualifying rounds, it meant a very early start to the season, in mid-July. Their first match was {{a trip to the}} remote Faroe Islands to play EB/Streymur. As Streymur's ground had a capacity of only 1,000, the match was moved to Tórsvøllur, the <b>Faroese</b> national stadium. Two early goals gave City a 2–0 win. The home leg was unusual in that it was played outside Manchester. The pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium had been relaid following a Bon Jovi concert, and was not ready in time. Instead, the match was played at Barnsley's Oakwell ground. Another 2–0 win resulted in a 4–0 aggregate scoreline. In the second qualifying round City played FC Midtjylland. The first leg ended in a 1–0 defeat, only City's second ever home defeat in European competition. In the second leg City looked to be heading out of the competition until an 89th minute cross was diverted into his own net by Midtjylland's Danny Califf. The tie then went to extra time, and City progressed on penalties. In the first round proper Cypriots AC Omonia took the lead, but City overcame the deficit and won 2–1, and also won the second leg by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|Ngwat-Mahop {{played in}} Red Bull Salzburg's opening {{match for the}} 2010–11 Bundesliga season, on 17 July 2010, coming in as a {{substitute}} in the 57th minute, in what was a 0–0 away draw against SV Kapfenberg. Three days later he once again played {{as a substitute for}} Jakob Jantscher, in his team's second leg match, against <b>Faroese</b> champions HB Torshavn for the second Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. He scored his first goal of the season in a match for the 1st round of the ÖFB-Cup against St. Pölten II, that Red Bull Salzburg won by 1–4. On 24 August, he made the cross that resulted in Red BullSalzburg's goal, in his team's second leg match for the third Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League against Hapoel Tel Aviv. Ngwat-Mahop was substituted in the 65th minute of a match that ended an 1–1 draw, resulting in Red Bull Salzburg's elimination. Later it was made known that he was again injured, and due to this he made his come back with Red Bull Salzburg almost three months later, in a 2–0 home win against Sturm Graz. That was meant to be Ngwat-Mahop's last game with the Red Bull Salzburg shirt, as in January he was sold to Greek Superleague outfit Iraklis Thessaloniki for an undisclosed fee.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of students in upper secondary schools are women, although men represent the majority in higher education institutions. In addition, most young <b>Faroese</b> people who relocate to other countries to study are women. Out of 8,535 holders of bachelor degrees, 4,796 (56.2%) have had their education in the Faroe Islands, 2,724 (31.9%) in Denmark, 543 in both the Faroe Islands and Denmark, 94 (1.1%) in Norway 80 in the United Kingdom and the rest in other countries. Out of 1,719 holders of master's degrees or PhDs, 1,249 (72.7% have had their education in Denmark, 87 (5.1%) in the United Kingdom, 86 (5%) in both the Faroe Islands and Denmark, 64 (3.7%) in the Faroe Islands, 60 (3.5%) in Norway and the rest in other countries (mostly EU and Nordic). Since there is no medical school in the Faroe Islands, all medical students have to study abroad; as of 2013, {{out of a total}} of 96 medical students, 76 studied in Denmark, 19 in Poland and 1 in Hungary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> written {{literature}} has only really {{developed in the}} past 100–200 years. This is {{mainly because of the}} islands' isolation, and also because the <b>Faroese</b> language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of <b>Faroese.</b> Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and <b>Faroese</b> folk songs accompanied the <b>Faroese</b> chain dance. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sung them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The <b>Faroese</b> folk songs, in <b>Faroese</b> called kvæði, are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the <b>Faroese</b> folk songs have been used by the <b>Faroese</b> Viking metal band Týr, i.e., Ormurin Langi.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Faroese</b> {{language}} conflict, {{which occurred}} roughly between 1908 and 1938, {{has been described}} as political and cultural in nature. The two languages competing to become the official language of the Faroe Islands were <b>Faroese</b> and Danish. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the language of the government, education and Church was Danish, whereas <b>Faroese</b> was the language of the people. The movement towards <b>Faroese</b> language rights and preservation was begun in the 1880s by a group of students. This spread to from 1920 onwards to a movement towards using <b>Faroese</b> in the religious and government sector. <b>Faroese</b> and Danish are now both official languages in the Faroe Islands.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Faroese</b> {{language}} {{is one of}} the smallest of the Germanic languages. Written <b>Faroese</b> (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to Icelandic and to their ancestor Old Norse, though the spoken {{language is}} closer to Norwegian dialects of Western Norway. Although <b>Faroese</b> is the official language on the islands, Danish is taught in schools and can be used by the <b>Faroese</b> government in public relations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> {{language}} policy {{provides for}} the active creation of new terms in <b>Faroese</b> suitable for modern life.|$|E
25|$|The {{domestic}} animals of the Faroe Islands {{are a result}} of 1,200 years of isolated breeding. As a result, many of the islands' {{domestic animals}} are found nowhere else in the world. <b>Faroese</b> domestic breed include Faroe pony, Faroe cow, Faroe sheep, <b>Faroese</b> goose and <b>Faroese</b> duck.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> {{is spoken}} {{in the entire}} area as a first language. It is {{difficult}} to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the <b>Faroese</b> language, because many ethnic <b>Faroese</b> live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.|$|E
25|$|These old verses {{are still}} sung by the <b>Faroese</b> today {{along with the}} {{traditional}} <b>Faroese</b> chain dance. In recent years the grindavísan has been sung in a more modern way by the <b>Faroese</b> Viking Metal band Týr, the melody is the same and the verses are the same, only much shorter version of the ballad and with instruments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese.</b> Non-Faroese {{accented letters}} are not {{added to the}} <b>Faroese</b> alphabet. These include é, ö, ü, å and {{recently}} also letters like š, ł, and ć.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been a great {{interest}} in <b>Faroese</b> sweaters from the TV series The Killing, where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Gråbøl) wears <b>Faroese</b> sweaters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> grammar {{is related}} and {{very similar to}} that of modern Icelandic and Old Norse. <b>Faroese</b> is an inflected {{language}} with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.|$|E
25|$|Under the Home Rule Act the <b>Faroese</b> Løgting is the {{legislative}} authority in special <b>Faroese</b> matters, defined as særanliggender, while other areas are administrated by the Danish national authorities as common matters, fællesanliggender. With {{the passing of}} a new statute in 1995 parliamentarism was legally adopted, {{and at the same}} time the structure and functions of the Løgting were modernised. A proper <b>Faroese</b> Constitution is planned and underway.|$|E
25|$|Old <b>Faroese</b> (miðaldarføroyskt, ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) {{is a form}} of Old Norse {{spoken in}} medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The {{language}} shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old <b>Faroese,</b> whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. The most crucial aspects of the development of <b>Faroese</b> are diphthongisation and palatalisation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> {{handicrafts}} {{are mainly}} based on materials available to local villages—mainly wool. Garments include jumpers, scarves, and gloves. <b>Faroese</b> jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations {{handed down from}} mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in <b>Faroese</b> knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This {{appears to be a}} reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific <b>Faroese</b> heritage.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) {{completed}} the first Bible translation into <b>Faroese</b> from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Viderø (Fólkakirkjan) {{completed the}} second translation in 1961. The latter was {{translated from the}} original Biblical languages (Hebrew and Greek) into <b>Faroese.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> {{people are}} very active in sports; they have {{domestic}} competitions in football, handball, volleyball, badminton, swimming, outdoor rowing (<b>Faroese</b> kappróður) and indoor rowing in rowing machines, horse riding, shooting, table tennis, judo, golf, tennis, archery, gymnastics, cycling, triathlon, running, and other competitions in athletics.|$|E
25|$|The republican {{coalition}} {{majority in}} parliament interpreted the results as a resolve by the <b>Faroese</b> people for full <b>Faroese</b> independence from Denmark {{and started the}} process of secession as well as establishing proper governing bodies for an independent <b>Faroese</b> nation. The Government of Denmark contested the legality of this process, and on 25 September the King of Denmark signed a document dissolving the <b>Faroese</b> parliament and a new election was held a few months later. This election resulted in a significant majority of 2,000 votes for the parties favoring a union with Denmark, and a new unionist coalition was formed. Based on their growth in votes they chose not to pass the secession, but as a compromise, the Home Rule Act was constituted and came into force on 1 April 1948.|$|E
25|$|Sea Shepherd Conservation Society led an {{operation}} called 2015 Sleppið Grindini on the Faroe Islands from 15 June until 1 October 2015. The Sea Shepherds works with direct action {{and there were}} several confrontations {{between them and the}} Faroese/Danish police, and several activists were arrested for disrupting during pilot whale hunts, both on sea and on land. The organisation succeeded in getting big media coverage from larger media from around the world. They took according to themselves lots of photos and many hours of video from the whale hunts, which they will use in order to damage <b>Faroese</b> tourism in order to put pressure on the <b>Faroese</b> authorities to end the pilot whale drive hunts. Through an email campaign there was also an attempt of pressuring the Danish Parliament to stop the hunt, but as part of the home rule act of 1948 all laws and regulations relating to fishing and hunting (such as whaling) in the Islands are governed by the <b>Faroese</b> Parliament. Just like the year before their campaign led to much public debate in the Faroe Islands and updating of the <b>Faroese</b> Grind Law. Their actions also seems to have pushed the <b>Faroese</b> politics into further self-governing. The <b>Faroese</b> foreign minister Poul Michelsen and the Danish minister of integration Inger Støjberg made an agreement that the Faroe Islands will take over foreign matters. The <b>Faroese</b> government from 2011–2015 asked the Danish government if they could forbid Sea Shepherd to enter the Faroe Islands after the 2014 GrindStop campaign had ended and before the 2015 Sleppið Grindini started, but the Danish government said no. The <b>Faroese</b> authorities will take over the responsibilities for foreign affairs sometime in 2016 according to the plan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Faroese</b> {{laws and}} the laws of the {{international}} communities allow for the <b>Faroese</b> pilot whale drive, while several international special interest groups object to this practice. Proponents of <b>Faroese</b> pilot whaling defend it with several arguments. The drive is described as essential to the <b>Faroese</b> culture and provides high quality food to substitute for the islands’ inability to sustain land based agriculture and that the number of whales taken are not harmful to the general pilot whale population. The pilot whale slaughter does not exist as a commercial slaughter and is proven as only a communal food distribution among local households. However, whale meat can be sold in restaurants. The slaughter of North Atlantic dolphin populations, at the rate of 0.1% per year, is sustainable for the species. In addition, proponents point to the <b>Faroese</b> law which prohibits causing an animal unnecessary harm, and {{to the fact that the}} current method (spinal lance and blunt hook) has been shown to generally cause immediate death in the animal within a second or so.|$|E
