5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (<b>hirsutism),</b> osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, <b>hirsutism</b> and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
25|$|Hypertrichosis {{is often}} mistakenly {{classified}} as <b>hirsutism.</b> <b>Hirsutism</b> {{is a type}} of hypertrichosis exclusive to women and children, resulting from an excess of androgen-sensitive hair growth. Patients with <b>hirsutism</b> exhibit patterns of adult male hair growth. Chest and back hair are often present on women with <b>hirsutism.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{virilization}} (acne, voice changes, <b>hirsutism)</b> of {{the adult}} female.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{forms of}} hypertrichosis are rare. Only 50 cases of {{congenital}} hypertrichosis lanuginosa {{have been recorded}} since the Middle Ages, and fewer than 100 cases of congenital generalized hypertrichosis have been documented in scientific publications and by the media. Congenital generalized hypertrichosis is isolated to one family in Mexico. Acquired hypertrichosis and <b>hirsutism</b> are more common. For example, <b>hirsutism</b> occurs in about 10% of women between ages 18 and 45.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which mild 3β-HSD CAH can cause early {{appearance}} of pubic hair {{and other aspects of}} hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with <b>hirsutism</b> have not been confirmed and it now appears that premature pubarche in childhood and <b>hirsutism</b> after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hirsutism</b> is both {{congenital}} and acquired. It {{is linked}} to excessive male hormones in women, thus symptoms may include acne, deepening of the voice, irregular menstrual periods, {{and the formation of}} a more masculine body shape. Increases in androgen (male hormone) levels are the primary cause of most <b>hirsutism</b> cases. If caused by increased levels of androgens, it can be treated with medications that reduce androgen levels. Some birth control pills and spironolactone reduce androgen levels.|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, <b>hirsutism</b> (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., anovulation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea), clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, teratogenicity (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} prevention of pregnancy, but is also prescribed for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and <b>hirsutism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} – {{a complex}} syndrome in {{women in the}} reproductive years where anovulation and androgen excess are commonly displayed as <b>hirsutism.</b> In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.|$|E
25|$|When {{appropriate}} (e.g., {{in women}} of child-bearing age who require contraception), a standard contraceptive pill is frequently {{effective in reducing}} <b>hirsutism.</b> Progestogens such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel should be avoided due to their androgenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} of {{medications}} including gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus, <b>hirsutism</b> (excessive hair growth in a male-pattern distribution) with ciclosporin, hair loss with tacrolimus, obesity, acne, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include flutamide, and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in <b>hirsutism.</b> Metformin can reduce <b>hirsutism,</b> perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and dutasteride) may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
25|$|Birth {{control pills}} {{are the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed hormonal treatment for <b>hirsutism,</b> as they prevent ovulation and decrease androgen production by the ovaries. Additionally, estrogen in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissue {{possesses}} aromatase, {{an enzyme}} that converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for <b>hirsutism</b> and virilization) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{directly}} blocks androgen signaling {{and also}} {{acts as an}} inhibitor of androgen production. Due to the antiandrogenic effects that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a role. Some of these uses include androgenic alopecia in men (either at low doses or as a topical formulation) and women, and <b>hirsutism</b> (excessive hair growth), acne, and seborrhea in women. Spironolactone is {{the most commonly used}} drug in the treatment of <b>hirsutism</b> in the United States. Higher doses of spironolactone are not recommended in males due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Similarly, it is also commonly used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Other {{names for}} this {{syndrome}} include polycystic ovary disease, functional ovarian hyperandrogenism, ovarian hyperthecosis, sclerocystic ovary syndrome, and Stein–Leventhal syndrome. The eponymous last option {{is the original}} name; it is now used, if at all, only for the subset of women with all the symptoms of amenorrhea with infertility, <b>hirsutism,</b> and enlarged polycystic ovaries.|$|E
25|$|If the {{condition}} has not already been diagnosed, it usually becomes apparent at puberty around age twelve with primary amenorrhoea and virilization. This may include descending of the testes, <b>hirsutism</b> (facial/body hair considered normal in males - {{not to be}} confused with hypertrichosis), deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris into what would then be classed as a penis.|$|E
25|$|Androgens like {{testosterone}} and DHT play {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including acne, seborrhea, <b>hirsutism</b> (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5α-reductase type II deficiency 5α-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and <b>hirsutism</b> as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to normal biological functions, DHT also {{plays an important}} causative role {{in a number of}} androgen-dependent conditions including skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, <b>hirsutism,</b> and pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia or pattern baldness) and prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. 5α-Reductase inhibitors, which prevent DHT synthesis, are effective in the prevention and treatment of these conditions.|$|E
25|$|There is also mixed/conflicting {{evidence}} that spironolactone may inhibit 5α-reductase, {{and thus the}} synthesis of the potent androgen DHT from testosterone, to some extent. However, the combination of spironolactone and the potent 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride {{has been found to}} have significant improved effectiveness in the treatment of <b>hirsutism</b> relative to spironolactone therapy alone, suggesting that any inhibition of 5α-reductase by spironolactone is only weak or at best incomplete.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is usually}} {{used in the}} form of oral tablets. The drug has also been marketed {{in the form of}} 2% and 5% topical cream in Italy for the {{treatment}} of acne and <b>hirsutism</b> under the brand name Spiroderm, although this product is no longer available. Spironolactone has poor water solubility, and for this reason, only oral and topical formulations have been developed and other routes of administration such as intravenous injection are not employed.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{ketoconazole}} are sometimes harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat <b>hirsutism</b> and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as <b>hirsutism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is {{a potent}} and direct {{antagonist}} of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor. The AR antagonism of spironolactone mostly underlies its antiandrogen activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits {{in the treatment of}} androgen-dependent conditions like acne, <b>hirsutism,</b> and pattern hair loss and its usefulness in hormone therapy for transgender women. In addition, the AR antagonism of spironolactone is involved in its feminizing side effects like gynecomastia in men.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{symptoms}} {{could be due to}} polycystic ovary syndrome, a complex multi-endocrine disorder including <b>hirsutism</b> (male pattern/type hair growth) due to increased androgen hormone levels, and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects. As she had very little comprehension for the need of most social norms and little desire to act, dress, or do other social norms, preferring to wearing, acting, and doing only that which she deemed logically practical, Buckley suggested Pervasive Developmental Disorder i.e., Asperger's Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{methyltestosterone}} include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, <b>hirsutism,</b> clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
25|$|Certain antiandrogens do {{not reduce}} {{testosterone}} or prevent its action upon tissues, but instead prevent its metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from forming. These medications {{can be used}} when the patient has male-pattern hair loss and/or an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), both of which DHT exacerbates. Two medications are currently available to prevent the creation of DHT: finasteride and dutasteride. DHT levels can be lowered up to 60–75% with the former, and up to 93–94% with the latter. These medications have also {{been found to be}} effective in the treatment of <b>hirsutism</b> in women.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{the first}} anti{{androgen}}, or androgen antagonist, was discovered. Antiandrogens antagonise the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby block the biological effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Antiandrogens {{are important for}} men with hormonally responsive diseases like prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP), acne, seborrhea, <b>hirsutism</b> and androgen alopecia. Antiandrogens are mainly used {{for the treatment of}} prostate diseases. Research from 2010 suggests that ARs could be linked to the disease progression of triple-negative breast cancer and salivary duct carcinoma and that antiandrogens can potentially be used to treat it.|$|E
25|$|Other alleles {{result in}} even milder degrees of hyperandrogenism {{that may not}} even cause {{problems}} in males {{and may not be}} recognized until adolescence or later in females. Mild androgen effects in young women may include <b>hirsutism,</b> acne, or anovulation (which in turn can cause infertility). Testosterone levels in these women may be mildly elevated, or simply above average. These clinical features, of course, are those of polycystic ovary syndrome, and a small percentage of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are found to have late-onset CAH when investigated.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to be metabolized by 5α-reductase and the AR activity of the resultant metabolites appears {{to be one of}} the major, if not the most important determinant of the androgenic-myotrophic ratio for a given AAS. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), <b>hirsutism</b> (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. The AR antagonistic (i.e., antiandrogen) activity of spironolactone was first discovered and reported in 1969, which shortly followed the discovery in 1968 that gynecomastia, a frequent {{and by that}} time well-established side effect of spironolactone, is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. The drug started to be used as an antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of <b>hirsutism</b> in women, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of <b>hirsutism.</b> Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, <b>hirsutism,</b> and increased sex drive.|$|E
25|$|A large {{clinical}} study of high to very high oral dosages of NET (10 to 40mg/day) administered for prolonged {{periods of time}} (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild voice changes (hoarseness), acne, and <b>hirsutism</b> and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, virilization of the genitals. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of NET of 30mg/day or more {{for a period of}} 15weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{antiandrogen}} {{activity of}} spironolactone, {{it can be}} quite effective in treating acne in women, and also reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered {{to be one of}} the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of <b>hirsutism</b> in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female pattern hair loss (FPHL). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, it should be noted that not all cases of FHPL are dependent on androgens.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both cyproterone acetate and flutamide have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with flutamide and has resulted in cyproterone acetate never being approved in the United States. Bicalutamide is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to flutamide, but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat <b>hirsutism</b> with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for antiandrogen therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as generics. As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported antiandrogen option in some cases.|$|E
