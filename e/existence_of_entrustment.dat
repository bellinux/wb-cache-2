5000|$|Promoters of veneration of the Holy Name of Mary include: Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, and Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori. A {{number of}} {{religious}} orders {{such as the}} Cistercians, customarily give each member [...] "Mary" [...] as part of his/her name in religion as a sign honor and <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> to her.|$|R
5000|$|The European Commission {{has stated}} [...] that an [...] "act of entrustment" [...] is {{necessary}} in order to set out the public service obligations of the undertaking and must have been committed to the organisation through an official act having legal force under the national law of the relevant EU member state. There need not be any specific legal framework covering acts <b>of</b> <b>entrustment,</b> but the act must extend sufficiently to create an obligation or accountability: permission, such as legal recognition or regulatory approval would not be sufficient. The obligation may be set out in legislation, the terms of a contract or in certain cases in a grant agreement. The act <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> should, in particular, state the nature, territorial scope and duration of the public service obligations, the organisation concerned, and the nature of any exclusive or special rights which the organisation may be able to exercise, along with the mechanism for calculating the level of compensation.|$|R

25|$|Other prayers honouring Mary's immaculate {{conception}} are in use outside the formal liturgy. The hymn Immaculate Mary, addressed to Mary as the Immaculately Conceived One, is {{closely associated with}} Lourdes. The Immaculata prayer, composed by Saint Maximillian Kolbe, is a prayer <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> to Mary as the Immaculata. A novena of prayers, with a specific prayer {{for each of the}} nine days has been composed under the title of the Immaculate Conception Novena.|$|R
50|$|On 25th March 1984 Pope John Paul II {{fulfilled}} {{this request}} again, {{when he made}} the solemn act of consecration of the world, and implicitly of Russia, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary before the miraculous statue of Our Lady of Fátima brought to Saint Peter's Square in the Vatican for the occasion. Sister Lúcia, OCD, then the only surviving visionary of Fátima apparitions, confirmed that the request of Mary for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was accepted by Heaven, and therefore, was fulfilled. Again on 8th October 2000, the same pope made an act <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> <b>of</b> the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the new millennium.|$|R
50|$|Preparation for the Great Jubilee {{began when}} Pope John Paul II issued his Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente (As the Third Millennium Approaches) on November 10, 1994.

The first year, 1997 would be marked by an exploration of the person of Jesus, the second, 1998, by meditation on the person of the Holy Spirit, and the third, 1999, by meditation on the person of God the Father. Each year was also to be marked by a special prayer <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> to the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|R
40|$|PhDThis study {{focuses on}} the {{particular}} course taken by the theory of sexual difference (il pensiero della differenza sessuale) in Italy. It examines Italian feminism as a current which has received hitherto little international attention. The {{first part of the}} thesis situates Italian feminism in relation to the more familiar French and Anglo-American contexts in order to consider its distinctiveness. The main body of the study then considers the historical and political emergence of contemporary Italian feminism, the elaboration of a social-symbolic practice called "entrustment" ("affidamento"), beginning in 1983, and the hegemony achieved by the theory of sexual difference amongst the majority of feminist groups. Here, I develop the central argument of the thesis: it is the elaboration <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> which has first occasioned contemporary Italian feminism, as a whole, to engage with a theory of sexual difference adapted to the highly politicised Italian context. The last section of the thesis critically evaluates entrustment and the symbolic order of the Mother created by it, and considers the debates surrounding such a social-symbolic practice. Adriana Cavarero provides an original point of view on contemporary Italian feminism since she is both a fierce critic <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> and one <b>of</b> the leading exponents of ilpensiero. The final chapter thus utilises Cavarero's theory in order to postulate that entrustment is best considered as part of a plural but common Italian strategy of "practising" relationships between women.

40|$|As residents, we {{constantly}} {{strive to}} independently manage our patients and develop care plans, while {{the role of}} the attending faculty varies between complete supervision and control, to allowing complete autonomy. This concept of attending physicians allowing appropriate autonomy so that residents can develop independence in their practice has been termed entrustment. Patients' and instructors' <b>entrustment</b> <b>of</b> responsibility reflects upon one's preparedness to assume professional responsibility after graduation. Over the past several months, we have been reflecting on our experiences working in the emergency department and how different faculty members entrust residents during each shift. Some experiences have been incredible as we develop our styles of practice, while others have been incredibly frustrating and soured the learning environment. As third‐year residents, we studied the factors that allow faculty to foster an appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> and conducted discussions with multiple residents on this topic. We have found several themes of how this can be done well and share these ideas with a goal of improving autonomy for emergency medicine residents...|$|R
25|$|At the thirty-fifth {{regular meeting}} of the Conference of Heads of Government ending on July 4, 2014, Reuben Meade, Premier of Montserrat, {{announced}} that Montserrat intends to accede to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas by the next {{meeting of the}} Conference, {{paving the way for}} its full participation in the Community and particularly the CSME. Montserrat has been progressively making steps towards accession to the Revised Treaty, including obtaining the necessary instrument <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> from the United Kingdom.

40|$|Development {{policy and}} {{practice}} in fragile and conflict-affected areas needs to be rethought. A growing proportion of aid budgets is going to fragile and conflict-affected states and conflict prevention is becoming an important focus of aid spend even in countries that are not affected by widespread violence. Thus, there is a rationale for development and security being increasingly brought together. The issue is {{how to do this}} most effectively to promote the security of the poor. While development in violent environments is very different from development in stable and peaceful areas, {{the same is true for}} security. One of the key differences is the fragmentation of power and authority which makes it more difficult for outsiders to operate. Development stakeholders need to invest more in understanding local realities, politics and power. This report proposes a ‘new deal’ based on concepts <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> and brokerage to help them do so. DfI...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the establishment of biobanks for genetic and genomic studies around the globe. One example of this is the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative (H 3 Africa), which has established biobanks in the sub-region to facilitate future indigenous genomic studies. The concept of ‘broad consent’ has been proposed as a mechanism to enable potential research participants in biobanks to give permission for their samples to be used in future research studies. However, questions remain about the acceptability of this model of consent. Drawing on findings from empirical research about the role of trust in decision-making, we argue that an account <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> may be an appropriate way of addressing current challenges of seeking consent for biobank research in Africa. We propose a set of key points to consider that can support the proposed entrustment framework...|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) is the Caribbean {{regional}} judicial tribunal {{established on}} 14 February 2001, by the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice.

It is worth highlighting the legal framework provided by article 11, in particular focusing on the unification of directive roles and the abolition of the two executive classes.

40|$|An {{enduring}} {{challenge for}} administrative law is {{the tension between the}} ideal of democratic policymaking and the ubiquity of bureaucratic discretion. This Article seeks to reframe the problem of agency discretion by outlining an interpretivist model of administrative law based on the concept of fiduciary obligation in private legal relations such as agency, trust, and corporation. Administrative law, like private fiduciary law, increasingly relies upon a tripartite framework <b>of</b> <b>entrustment,</b> residual control, and fiduciary duty to demarcate a domain of bounded agency discretion. To minimize the risk that agencies will abuse their entrusted discretion through opportunism or carelessness, administrative law empowers the political branches to exert limited residual control over agencies and subjects agencies to nonderogable duties of care and loyalty. As an interpretivist theory, this fiduciary model helps to explain controversial features of administrative law such as the contemporary nondelegation doctrine, Chevron deference, and the limits of presidential control over agency action. By clarifying administrative law 2 ̆ 7 s internal dynamics and implicit ambitions, the fiduciary model also provides a blueprint for reform in critical areas such as the standing doctrine and the due process restraints on agency discretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of Public Service Obligations (PSO) {{in the network}} sectors of SGEIs are defined by the normative values of a good administrative protocol with sectoral rules set out in EU legislation. The Europeanisation of these sectors provides a coherent base which informs the national approaches in providing for acts <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> {{and the establishment of}} independent national regulatory agencies. This paper examines the development of this model and provides a comparison with the approach taken in economic social services sectors where Member States face a developing imperative to designate essential SSGI as SGEI. This is a social services environment in which a growing Public Service Industry is increasingly seeing private sector economic actors enjoy a general advantage over third sector not-for-profit and charity entities, in the public procurement processes. The comparison highlights the significant differences in the way that PSOs are expressed between the network SGEIs and the ‘social’ SGEIs and raises a question of whether it is time to consider, in at least some social services sectors, whether the {{expression of}} PSOs should be re-modelled {{in such a way as}} to replicate those in the network SGEI sectors...|$|R

Montserrat also issues land holding licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure in seeking to comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery. Montserrat's compliance with the movement of capital obligations under the CSME is already assured {{within the framework of the}} East Caribbean Currency Union.|$|R

We prove that the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a rigid saturated μ-minimal ideal on μ^+, where μ is a regular cardinal, is consistent relative to the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> large cardinals. The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> such an ideal implies that GCH fails.
