500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally <b>filling</b> <b>her</b> britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crandon used a {{trick in}} an attempt to fool psychical {{researchers}} that the [...] "spirit" [...] voices in her séances did not come from her own mouth. According to magician John Booth this was performed by Crandon <b>filling</b> <b>her</b> mouth with water before the séance had started and when the lights were turned off, swallowing the water. Before the end of the séance she would refill her mouth with water from a corked test tube. Crandon's reputation was also damaged when a fingerprint left on wax ostensibly by her channeled spirit, her deceased brother, Walter, was discovered to belong to her dentist Frederick Caldwell {{by a member of the}} Boston Society for Psychical Research. Her dentist divulged that he had taught her how to make these prints.|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript {{of her last}} novel (posthumously published), Between the Acts, Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. [...] The onset of World War II, the destruction of her London home during the Blitz, and the cool reception given to [...] of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until {{she was unable to}} work. [...] When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard, Virginia disapproved. [...] She held fast to her pacifism and criticized her husband for wearing what she considered to be the silly uniform of the Home Guard. [...] After World War II began, Woolf's diary indicates that she was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as her mood darkened. On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by <b>filling</b> <b>her</b> overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until 18 April. [...] Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monk's House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.|$|E
2500|$|Tatiana [...] "Tati" [...] Angela Lansbury Romanov {{was adopted}} by Alexandra Silber on April 2, 2014. The names [...] "Tatiana" [...] and [...] "Romanov" [...] derive from Silber's love of {{everything}} Russian, particularly the last Imperial family, while [...] "Angela Lansbury" [...] {{is the name of}} Silber's only idol. Tati began her journey to internet fame with the creation of Tumblr blog, [...] "I Feel Kitty", in May 2014. The blog inspired Tati's Instagram account, @ifeelkitty. As its handle suggests, the account is a collection of portraits with musical theatre-themed captions. During an interview with Broadway.com's Paul Wontorek in August 2016, Silber noted, [...] "(Tati is) as dramatic as I am, if not more." [...] The feline has been featured on Playbill's official Snapchat stories and in the account's profile photo. Tati, as Silber mentions on her blog, [...] "sure knows how {{to make the most of}} her life's work of downtime" [...] by <b>filling</b> <b>her</b> busy schedule with as many naps as she possibly can. Tati is also the subject of Silber's [...] "Cat in a Box" [...] song.|$|E
