40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{reactive}} distillation (RD) has received significant attention {{because of the}} technological and economic advantages obtained from the simultaneous occurrence of reaction and separation. Although the advantages of RD are welldocumented in the literature, the commercial applications of RD are still limited because of the control and operation complexity of these separation systems {{and the need for}} improved software tools to reliably model and design RD columns. In this study, a robust short-cut method for the design of multicomponent reactive distillation is presented. This method is based on distillation lines and tray-by-tray calculations defined in terms of reaction-invariant composition variables. Our method provides the number of theoretical stages, the operating reflux ratio, the feed tray location, and the top or bottom flow. We use three case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, namely, the reactive systems for the syntheses of ETBE and MTBE in the presence of <b>inert</b> <b>components</b> and of TAME without <b>inert</b> <b>components.</b> The results obtained with our strategy show good agreement with those obtained using the rigorous model of the commercial simulator AspenONE Aspen Plus. 1...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the Morgantown Energy Technology Center, Department of Energy (DOE/METC) is {{actively}} investigating alternative hot fuel gas desulfurization sorbents for {{application to the}} Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC). A sorbent must be highly active towards sulfur at high temperatures and pressures, and under varying degrees of reducing atmospheres. Also, it must regenerate nearly ideally to maintain activity over numerous cycles. Furthermore, regeneration must yield a sulfur product which is economically recoverable directly or indirectly. Several metal oxides have been investigated as regenerable sorbents {{for the removal of}} hydrogen sulfide (the primary sulfur bearing compound) from hot fuel gases. MnO was shown to have an intrinsic reaction rate approximately one order of magnitude greater than the rate or reaction with either CaO or ZnO and two orders of magnitude greater than the reaction rate with V{sub 2 } 0 {sub 3 }. Manganese also shows desulfurization potential in the temperature range of 600 - 700 {degrees}C where metal oxides currently known to be reactive with H{sub 2 }S are unsatisfactorily.

40|$|Biological {{membranes}} typically {{contain a}} large number of different components dispersed in small concentrations in the main membrane phase, including proteins, sugars, and lipids of varying geometrical properties. Most of these components do not bind the cargo, but as we show here, such `inert' components can be crucial in precisely controlling cross-membrane trafficking. Using a statistical mechanics model and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that expressing <b>inert</b> membrane <b>components</b> of small isotropic curvatures in one leaflet of the membrane dramatically influences cargo endocytosis, even if the total spontaneous curvature of such a membrane remains unchanged. Curved lipids, such as cholesterol, as well as asymmetrically included proteins and tethered sugars can all be actively participating in controlling cross-membrane trafficking of nanoscopic cargo. We find that even the low-level expression of membrane components of various curvatures can determine the membrane selectivity towards the cargo size, and can be used to selectively target membranes of certain compositions. Our results suggest a robust and general way to control cargo trafficking by adjusting the membrane composition without needing to alter the concentration of receptors nor the average membrane curvature.
