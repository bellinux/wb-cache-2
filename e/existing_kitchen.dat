5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time that she took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the <b>existing</b> <b>kitchen</b> was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E

50|$|The {{house that}} Simpson lived in was {{much smaller than}} the Wolston {{homestead}} that now exists. He had arrived in Brisbane as a recent widower and lived simply, so that a large or formal dwelling would have been unnecessary to him. He constructed a two-room brick cottage over a sandstone basement. The house was shingled and had a detached kitchen. This cottage now forms the core of the house. The <b>existing</b> sandstone <b>kitchen</b> which adjoins this section may have been added by Simpson before he sold the house in 1860 or it may have been added by Goggs.|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to signifi cantly ease kitchen chores with properly sized and appropriately arranged cupboards. In designing kitchen furniture and the optimal depth and the height of storage capacities, accessibility {{should be taken into}} consideration. It is known that the optimal storage zone is between 800 and 1100 mm and that there is reduced visibility and accessibility at the level between 1400 and 1700 mm, which is even more prominent for the elderly. This suggests that wall cabinets are not recommended for the elderly. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine to what extent kitchens manufactured by Slovenian furniture manufacturers are suitable for users of different age groups with regard to the accessibility of goods stored in the cupboards. Furthermore, based on the measurement analysis, recommendations are provided for designing kitchen furniture that would meet the needs of the elderly. The study, carried out using a computer simulation model, analyzed the products of three Slovenian kitchen manufacturers. The cross section of accessibility in the wall cabinets was determined for different age groups of men and women. The results show that the effi cacy of the volume in wall cabinets higher than 600 mm, in comparison to places where objects are easily reachable, is 30 % lower for women, thus indicating the ineffi ciency of storage space in wall cabinets. In terms of accessibility, <b>existing</b> <b>kitchens</b> are not optimal for the elderly, and a model with a deeper worktop and wall cabinets lowered onto the worktop is proposed. Accessibility in such wall cabinets is increased by up to 70 % if the body is moved forward by 30 °...|$|R
5000|$|The United State's {{progress}} in reducing domestic hunger {{had been thrown}} into reverse by the Great depression of the 1930s. The existence of hunger within the U.S. became a widely discussed issue due to coverage in the Mass media. Both civil society and government responded. <b>Existing</b> soup <b>kitchens</b> and bread lines run {{by the private sector}} increased their opening times, and many new ones were established. Government sponsored relief {{was one of the main}} strands of the New Deal launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some of the government established Alphabet agencies aimed to relieve poverty by raising wages, others by reducing unemployment as with the Works Progress Administration. The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation aimed to directly tackle hunger by providing poor people with food. [...] By the late 1940s, these various relief efforts combined with improved economic conditions had been successful in substantially reducing hunger within the United States.|$|R

50|$|Blandwood is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on original foundations {{in the city of}} Greensboro (1795). Originally located within a rural context, it is a remarkable survivor of urban development as the city grew around the house. Its primary national significance is its role as the earliest identified Tuscan Villa in the United States (1844). Architect A. J. Davis designed the building to resemble villas of Tuscany (though he never visited Italy) using wide overhanging eaves, low rooflines, casement windows, stucco-on-brick veneer, and most notably the tall prospect tower which dominated the facade. Davis adaptively reused the <b>existing</b> free-standing <b>kitchen</b> by expanding its size and matching it with a nearly identical building {{on the other side of}} the house, creating freestanding hyphen wings with arcades. The building is also a rare example of grand antebellum architecture in the Piedmont section of North Carolina - a territory characterized by small farms and a relatively small enslaved population.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{done during the}} spring {{semester}} 2017 for the Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Design programme at Karlstads University. The contractor of the thesis project was 3 TEMP AB, based in Arvika, Sweden. 3 TEMP has a vision that with {{a new type of}} product {{they will be able to}} establish themselves on a new market, the domestic market.  They have plans on a coffee machine that can be integrated into new bought and currently <b>existing</b> <b>kitchens.</b> The company already have solutions to how the product's main function should operate, what is needed is a concrete concept.  The purpose of the project has been to produce a concept on an integrated coffee machine that guides the user to proper use and simplifies maintenance. In order to achieve this, the design process has been used. The design process included a preliminary study, idea generation, concept development, concept evaluation and finally construction. Based on the client's requirements, what has emerged from user interviews and market analyzes, a product specification has been produced. The requirements of the product specification was certain measurements, the product must be user friendly, product self cost and 3 TEMP's existing brewing mechanism must be applied.   The idea generation has been conducted together with classmates and other students who studies innovation and design. The people chosen for the idea generation are all involved in the product development process and are familiar with the methodology used. The ideas that emerged from the generation have been combined with each other in different designs. The ideas combined have been compiled into several concepts that then were evaluated using an elimination matrix, relative decision matrix and a criteria weight matrix. The final selection of concept was made by the contractor.   The definitive concept include elements from the contractor's design of their existing products, in order for the product to suit the company's identity.  The chosen concept has been tested with physical models to ensure that 3 TEMP's existing technology should fit in the design and that all dimensions are correct. A more detailed model was made, as well as a CAD model to visualize the concept. A sectioned image created in CAD displays the layout of the product. Rendered images of the product were made where the product is seen integrated in a kitchen...|$|R

50|$|Each house {{consists}} of six main rooms and three bathrooms, {{the plan of}} which is roughly rectangular. The facades are asymmetrically arranged so that the front bedroom of each house projects forward and a small verandah is created. Original cast iron lacework and posts decorate the front verandahs and the window hood brackets. At the rear of each house are verandahs at two levels that are decorated with introduced timber balustrading and decorative timber brackets. The verandahs are separated by a deep timber valance and the soffits are fitted with introduced ripple iron that has been painted. The brick firewalls which separate the pairs of residences, are cement rendered {{at the front of}} the properties only and plastered internally. The internal partition walls at street level are single skinned with vertical beaded tongue and groove boards on a timber frame. The ceilings are also tongue and grooved boards except in the living and dining rooms where plasterboard with plaster ceiling roses has been introduced. At the lower level the walls and ceilings are all plasterboard on timber frames. Floors throughout the house are timber boards overlaid with carpet in the main rooms and vinyl or ceramic tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms. Some original cedar joinery such as architraves and four panelled doors survive at the street level, however most, including the timber fireplace surrounds and the timber consoles in the entry hall, have been introduced during the 1990 renovations. Obscure patterned glass has been fitted into the fanlights above each door at street level and coloured glass into the sidelights of the front door. Each house has two sets of staircases connecting the two floor levels; one internal and the other external. The internal staircase has been entirely reconstructed however the external staircase at the rear contains some original fabric at its upper reaches. The <b>existing</b> <b>kitchen</b> and bathroom fittings and fixtures were all introduced at the time of renovation.|$|E

It then focuses on a young child wearing a red shirt, who sits at the kitchen table. The child looks left, to a child in blue next to the kitchen bench. The blue child offers him a choice between two types of white bread. He chooses the sliced loaf. The red child looks to his right, which causes the camera perspective to change and shows the <b>kitchen</b> <b>existing</b> as a cube in a white area. Vocalist Yojiro Noda stands outside this area, levitating and spinning a piece of white bread above his finger. Other band members move in slow motion as a 3D graphic of sliced white bread falls apart.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was built}} by Robert Sims Burch using slave labor in 1856, built upon a c.1848 foundation. Its NRHP {{nomination}} describes it as [...] "excellent" [...] and {{as one of the}} finest cottages in Thomasville. It is a one-and-a-half-story building with a front gable second floor overhanging a front porch, supported by six square pillars. Its original detached kitchen and dining room were destroyed by a fire in 1888 and replacements were added to the main house. The house was originally set far back from the road, down a magnolia-lined lane, but it was moved forward to its <b>existing</b> location. The <b>kitchen</b> and dining room portion is now used as a house on an adjacent lot.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design {{optimization}} of <b>existing</b> produt (<b>kitchen</b> scale) for better improvement by using Boothroyd-Dewhurst Design for Assembly (DFA) Methodology. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to generate a new design of kitchen scale that consider the matter of parts elimination, cost estimation, and design efficiency (DE). The thesis describes the Boothroyd-Dewhurst DFA method in obtaining the suggestion for redesign of the parts evaluated. The strategy of evaluating the existing design is first to choose the available product in the market in order to solve a problem. The product choosen were then disassembled into several families or sub-assemblies. This is for understanding how the parts functioning during normal operating mode. After that, each parts been critics and study {{if there is a}} chances for redesign. Finally, referring to suggestion from Boothroyd-Dewhurst DFA method, the new parts design are generated. From the results, it is observed that the analysis using Boothroyd-Dewhurst DFA method is easier for determine the parts to be redesign. The acquired results utilizing the new design are much more efficient then the original design after the evaluation due to maximum reduction of components like screw and fasteners. However, reducing the parts not always meant that the design are being optimize. There are much more things to consider like the manufacturing process required to produce the new design. Therefore, the concept of concurrent engineering (CE) is important to have designers and production engineers way of thinking in redesigning the new parts or components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The kitchen {{is often a}} focal point within the domestic home; comprising social, psychological and physical elements. 'Transitions in Kitchen Living' aims to examine the role, function and design of the kitchen as it affects the lives of older people living in domestic and supportive housing in both urban and rural locations. A cross-generational perspective will focus on historical and contemporary aspects of kitchen life - through biographical, ergonomic and visual research. The research will be grounded in secondary analysis of two existing data sets:  the EPSRC EQUAL funded 'Profiling the Housing Stock for Older People' and the ESRC funded 'Environment and Identity in Later Life'. A purposive sample of 48 older people will then participate in focussed research through in-depth oral histories of kitchen living, consideration of individual health and well-being, and ergonomic assessment of present kitchens capturing opinion and behaviour. Findings from this research {{will contribute to the}} oral history of kitchen living; provide greater understanding of person/environment fit in terms of individual morale; and lead to more inclusive design through the development of an on-line resource where the voices, experiences and actions of older people will enhance <b>existing</b> guidance on <b>kitchen</b> design...|$|R
40|$|The ways {{in which}} {{individual}} catering appliances were used, {{as well as the}} planning of meal production, have been studied for five catering facilities (namely for 3 canteens, an hotel and a psychiatric hospital). For each kitchen, activity charts were deduced from the observed patterns of use of each appliance. Several of the identified practices, such as switching-on appliances well before necessary, incurred excessive energy consumptions. Other established habits, such as permitting inordinately-long cooking or holding periods for the food at elevated temperatures, increased energy consumptions and adversely affected the quality of the food produced. The undertaken surveys provided evidence for: 1. (i) the need to review <b>existing</b> practices within <b>kitchens,</b> in order to promote the adoption of more efficient operational procedures and equipment use; 2. (ii) the need, as a systematic requirement, to train staff in the effective uses of new appliances; 3. (iii) the incorporation of programmed timers to switch-on, as well as switch-off, equipment and so relieve staff of the worry that these items will not be at the desired temperatures (and so not be available for immediate use) when required; and 4. (iv) the removal from the kitchen of equipment which is no longer needed or is of low efficiency. ...|$|R

Results of a user study reveal an increase in both users ’ awareness of, and reflection about, their waste management and their motivation to improve their waste-related skills. With BinCam, we also explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change (e. g., socially evoked feelings of ‘guilt ’ for non-recycling or food disposal), which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI.
