25|$|Tove Jansson {{worked as}} an {{illustrator}} and cartoonist for the Swedish-language satirical magazine Garm from the 1930s to 1953. One of her political cartoons achieved a brief international fame: she drew Adolf Hitler as a crying baby <b>in</b> <b>diapers,</b> surrounded by Neville Chamberlain and other great European leaders, who tried to calm the baby down by giving it slices of cake – Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. Jansson also produced illustrations during this period for the Christmas magazines Julen and Lucifer (just as her mother had earlier) {{as well as several}} smaller productions. Her earliest comic strips were produced for productions including Lunkentus (Prickinas och Fabians äventyr, 1929), Vårbrodd (Fotbollen som Flög till Himlen, 1930), and Allas Krönika (Palle och Göran gå till sjöss, 1933).|$|E

25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the microporous film used <b>in</b> <b>diapers</b> and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who {{had been}} seeking asylum in Sweden, were arrested by Swedish police in December 2001.

They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to Swedish investigative programme Kalla fakta. The Swedish ambassador visited them only six weeks later. Agiza was previously charged and sentenced in absentia with being an Islamic militant {{and was sentenced to}} 25 years, a sentence that was reduced to 15 years due to the political pressure after the Rendition became known. Al-Zery wasn't charged, and after two years in jail without ever seeing a judge or prosecutor he was sent to his village in Egypt. In 2008 AL Zery was awarded $500,000 in damages by the Swedish government for the wrongful treatment he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Adaptation of skin barrier {{function}} and interleukin- 1 Î± content <b>in</b> <b>diapered</b> and non-diapered skin are barely explored in healthy newborns performing standardized skin care. To investigate postnatal skin barrier maturation in healthy, full-term newborns <b>in</b> <b>diapered</b> and non-diapered skin comparing use of baby wipes to water moistened cotton wool. In a monocentric, prospective pilot study 44 healthy, full-term neonates aged â€ 48 hours {{were randomly assigned}} to the use of two skin care regimens: baby wipes (n= 21) or water moistened washcloth (n= 23) at each diaper change. Measurements included transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, skin-pH, interleukin- 1 Î±, epidermal desquamation, skin condition at day 2, 14 and 28 postpartum on diapered and non-diapered skin. Microbiological colonisation was evaluated at baseline and day 28. Significantly lower TEWL was found on the buttock using baby wipes compared to water at day 28. IL- 1 Î± and skin hydration significantly increased, pH decreased until week four independent of skin care regimen. IL- 1 Î± was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>diapered</b> skin compared to non-diapered skin. Baseline characteristics, skin condition and microbiology were comparable in both groups. Although diaper care with wipes seems to stabilize TEWL better than using water, the skin condition was comparable using both cleansing procedures. Increase of epidermal IL- 1 Î± may reflect postnatal skin barrier maturation. These data suggest that none of the two cleansing procedures may harm skin barrier maturation within the first four weeks postpartum...|$|R

2500|$|The age {{at which}} {{children}} should cease regularly wearing diapers and toilet training should begin is a subject of debate. Proponents of baby-led potty training and Elimination Communication argue that potty training can begin at birth with multiple benefits, with diapers only used as a back up.

2500|$|Extraordinary {{rendition}} {{provoked a}} diplomatic crisis between the United States and Sweden in 2006 when Swedish authorities {{put a stop}} to CIA rendition flights. In December 2001 Swedish police detained Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden. The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them <b>in</b> <b>diapers</b> and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P. [...] They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme [...] "Kalla fakta". A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law. In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA's transfer of al-Zari to Egypt. Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored. In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.|$|E
