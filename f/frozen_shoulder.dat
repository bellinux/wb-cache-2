40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo analyze {{changes in}} the capsule from {{idiopathic}} <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders</b> and clarify their etiology. Materials and methodsSamples (the rotator interval capsule, middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL), and inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)) were collected from 12 idiopathic <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders</b> with severe stiffness and 18 shoulders with rotator cuff tears as a control. The number of cells was counted and the tissue elasticity of the samples was calculated by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). The amount of glycosaminoglycan content was assessed by alcian blue staining. Gene and protein expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the total genes {{of the two groups}} were compared by DNA microarray analysis. ResultsThe number of cells was significantly higher and the capsular tissue was significantly stiffer in idiopathic <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders</b> compared with shoulders with rotator cuff tears. Staining intensity of alcian blue was significantly stronger in idiopathic <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Gene expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were significantly higher in idiopathic <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders</b> compared with shoulders with rotator cuff tears assessed by both qPCR and DNA microarray analysis.

40|$|Background: The {{axillary}} nerve may {{be injured}} during percutaneous fixation of proximal humerus frac-tures. This {{study investigated the}} kinematic behavior of the superior and inferior borders of the axillary nerve under varying shoulder positions. This information may reduce iatrogenic neurologic injury during fracture reduction and hardware placement. Methods: The lateral deltoid approach was performed on 7 fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The inferior and supe-rior borders of the axillary nerve were tagged. Screws {{were placed in the}} anterior, middle, and posterior acromion as landmarks. Three-dimensional distances of the inferior and superior border of the nerve were measured to the mid-acromion while the shoulder was placed in combinations of forward flexion, vertical abduction, and humeral rotation. The distances were compared by repeated measures ANOVA statistical analysis. Results: The distance from the mid-acromion to the superior border of the axillary nerve was 66. 6 mm (! 5. 7), and to the inferior axillary nerve was 75. 7 mm (! 5. 8) with the shoulder in neutral position. Vertical abduction to 60 " significantly moved the superior and inferior borders of the axillary nerve to a distance of 53. 9 (! 7. 7) and 61. 6 mm (! 8. 1), respectively (P 0. 5). The longest distance from the mid-acromion to the inferior border of the axillary nerve was 86 mm with the arm forward flexed. Conclusions: The main determinant of axillary nerve position with respect to the acromion is vertical abduction. Axillary nerve position is essentially unaffected by varying degrees of humeral rotation and forward flexion.

40|$|Summary: Twenty fresh <b>frozen</b> cadaver <b>shoulders</b> were {{dissected}} {{in order}} to study the rotator cable-crescent complex. The rotator crescent is a term that we have {{used to describe the}} thin, crescent-shaped sheet of rotator cuff com-prising the distal portions of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus insertions. The crescent was found to be bounded on its proximal margin by a thick bundle of fibers that we have called the rotator cable. This cable-crescent configura-tion was found to consistently span the insertions of supraspinatus and i-ffaspinatus tendons. The dimensions of the rotator cable and crescent were measured by a digital micrometer. The rotator cable was found to be a very substantial structure, averaging 2. 59 times the thickness of the rotator crescent that it surrounded. This anatomic study supports the concepts of stress-shielding of the rotator crescent by the stout rotator cable and stress transfer by this loaded cable system.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{glenohumeral joint}} kinematic protocols are highly effective for studying in vivo shoulder kinematics {{but are not}} anatomically specific enough to address the asymmetric changes in glenohumeral joint kinematics and do not provide clear anatomic definitions for landmarks and directions. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to develop an anatomically relevant and specimen-specific three-dimensional glenohumeral joint kinematic method as a new standard definition protocol for the glenohumeral coordinate systems (CSs). The in situ kinematic data of the intra-capsular glenoid-based CS of the glenohumeral joint were mathematically determined from the kinematic data of the extra-capsular CSs measured with an intact capsule. To minimize irreproducibility arising from discrepancy in initial specimen condition and error in determining CSs, several techniques were employed to determine anatomical landmarks and directions. To examine and demonstrate the details of this method, six fresh <b>frozen</b> cadaveric <b>shoulders</b> were used with a custom shoulder testing system. The accuracy and repeatability in the humeral head center (HHC) measurement were 0. 44 and 0. 41  mm, respectively. The inter-observer reliability for the location of the glenoid CS origin and HHC were 0. 37 and 0. 30  mm, respectively. The smaller anteroposterior (AP) depth of the glenoid with respect to the superoinferior (SI) depth (27. 3  ±  16. 5 %) was significantly correlated to the larger AP/SI translation ratio of the humeral head apex (191. 4  ±  43. 8 %, R =  0. 90, p =  0. 02).

40|$|Background: Arthroscopic sub-acromial {{decompression}} (decompressing the sub-acromial {{space by}} removing bone spurs and soft tissue arthroscopically) {{is a common}} surgery for subacromial shoulder pain, but its effectiveness is uncertain. We did a study to assess its effectiveness and to investigate the mechanism for surgical decompression. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group trial at 32 hospitals in the UK with 51 surgeons. Participants were patients who had subacromial pain for at least 3 months with intact rotator cuff tendons, were eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and had previously completed a non-operative management programme that included exercise therapy {{and at least one}} steroid injection. Exclusion criteria included a full-thickness torn rotator cuff. We randomly assigned participants (1 : 1 : 1) to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, investigational arthroscopy only, or no treatment (attendance of one reassessment appointment with a specialist shoulder clinician 3 months after study entry, but no intervention). Arthroscopy only was a placebo as the essential surgical element (bone and soft tissue removal) was omitted. We did the randomisation with a computer-generated minimisation system. In the surgical intervention groups, patients were not told which type of surgery they were receiving (to ensure masking). Patients were followed up at 6 months and 1 year after randomisation; surgeons coordinated their waiting lists to schedule surgeries {{as close as possible to}} randomisation. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (0 [worst] to 48 [best]) at 6 months, analysed by intention to treat. The sample size calculation was based upon a target difference of 4 · 5 points (SD 9 · 0). This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01623011. Findings: Between Sept 14, 2012, and June 16, 2015, we randomly assigned 313 patients to treatment groups (106 to decompression surgery, 103 to arthroscopy only, and 104 to no treatment). 24 [23 %], 43 [42 %], and 12 [12 %] of the decompression, arthroscopy only, and no treatment groups, respectively, did not receive their assigned treatment by 6 months. At 6 months, data for the Oxford Shoulder Score were available for 90 patients assigned to decompression, 94 to arthroscopy, and 90 to no treatment. Mean Oxford Shoulder Score did not differ between the two surgical groups at 6 months (decompression mean 32 · 7 points [SD 11 · 6] vs arthroscopy mean 34 · 2 points [9 · 2]; mean difference − 1 · 3 points (95 % CI − 3 · 9 to 1 · 3, p= 0 · 3141). Both surgical groups showed a small benefit over no treatment (mean 29 · 4 points [SD 11 · 9], mean difference vs decompression 2 · 8 points [95 % CI 0 · 5 – 5 · 2], p= 0 · 0186; mean difference vs arthroscopy 4 · 2 [1 · 8 – 6 · 6], p= 0 · 0014) but these differences were not clinically important. There were six study-related complications that were all <b>frozen</b> <b>shoulders</b> (in two patients in each group). Interpretation: Surgical groups had better outcomes for shoulder pain and function compared with no treatment but this difference was not clinically important. Additionally, surgical decompression appeared to offer no extra benefit over arthroscopy only. The difference between the surgical groups and no treatment might be the result of, for instance, a placebo effect or postoperative physiotherapy. The findings question the value of this operation for these indications, and this should be communicated to patients during the shared treatment decision-making process. </p...|$|R

Results Each tear involved the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus was additionally torn in six. The size of the tear was medium in eight and large in four. The length of the torn tendon edge was always longer than the length of the avulsed humeral insertion site. Retraction was 29. 9 ± 9. 3 mm (range 21 - 48 mm). The repair ratio, defined as the ratio of length of torn tendon edge to the length of avulsed humeral insertion site, was 2. 6 ± 0. 4 (range 2. 1 - 3. 5).
