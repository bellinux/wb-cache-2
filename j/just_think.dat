5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, <b>just</b> <b>think</b> by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should <b>just</b> <b>think</b> of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

In retrospect, 90 percent of the time I spent [...] ended up to be wasted time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I got {{the song}} and the lyrics, I {{thought it was an}} {{incredible}} song... And, to me, {{it turned out to be}} a country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Sister City" [...] largely portrayed Chavez and his socialist {{ideology}} {{in a negative}} light. The script portrays the Venezuelans as belittling and contemptuous toward Americans.
