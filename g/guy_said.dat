5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu {{was the first in}} a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. <b>Guy</b> <b>said</b> the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of the acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used as the title of a 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} among four other episodes {{submitted}} by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. [...] "And I'm Joyce Kinney" [...] was submitted, along with [...] "Halloween on Spooner Street", [...] "Road to the North Pole", [...] "New Kidney in Town" [...] and [...] "Trading Places". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award.

500|$|The episode {{has also}} been {{described}} as simultaneously embracing and parodying animated Christmas specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It {{has also been}} described as a commentary on the way Jewish children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday; this theme is overtly stated by Stan, who says {{at the end of the}} episode that Jews and Hanukkah [...] "can be cool" [...] as well as Christmas. M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family <b>Guy,</b> <b>said</b> although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas, [...] "even if spearheaded by a singing turd, [...] is about as close as South Park ever comes to being sentimental and nostalgic". Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode's [...] "strong, albeit dutifully ironic, undercurrent of conventional holiday decency." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and the <b>guy</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E

Hey U <b>Guys</b> <b>said</b> that the film is [...] "visually enticing with solid special effects and an enchanting score", with Smokescreenlondon adding that the [...] "kaleidoscopic vision of the capital is a striking feast for the eyes". The Velvet Onion concluded that the film is [...] "Beautifully-imagined and uncomfortably visceral" [...] and [...] "an astonishing achievement for a debut".|$|R

We realized what potential it still had, and the band and especially the horn <b>guys</b> <b>said,</b> 'You've got to do that!' So in a way, I agreed to do it at gun point. But when I got into it, I really liked singing that song. It's got some depth." ...|$|R
500|$|Film {{historian}} Randor <b>Guy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "1952... an eventful {{year for}} Tamil cinema, {{the beginning of}} a new period" [...] and added that [...] "The film that ushered in that new era was Parasakthi written for the screen by another fast-rising star Mu. Karunanidhi", while concluding that the film would be [...] "Remembered for the dialogue and the stunning performance of the new hero." [...] In an interview with Shobha Warrier of Rediff.com, Tamil film historian S. Theodore Baskaran said, [...] "Sivaji's best and most memorable films are his early ones" [...] and mentioned that Ganesan was [...] "very lucky to get a role in Parasakthi", which he praised for the [...] "flowery dialogues". Film historian S. Muthiah said that Parasakthi [...] "showed Karunanidhi as the master of meaningful screen dialogue that carried forceful messages to the masses". The Sunday Indian called it [...] "a classic DMK film scripted by M Karunanidhi". In a 2007 interview with S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu, director Balu Mahendra said, [...] "Parasakthis' heavy dialogue (written in chaste Tamil by the current Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi) coupled with a stunning performance by newcomer, Sivaji Ganesan, make it a favourite." [...] Film News Anandan called it [...] "one of the most elaborately plotted melodramas in the Indian cinema".|$|E
500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which <b>Guy</b> <b>said</b> was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, an {{expedition}} party of five including a 59-year-old Arkless succeeded in crossing the Garhwal {{region of the}} Indian Himalaya between the Hindu temples of Badrinath and Kedarnath, a feat that had only been accomplished once before, in 1934. In 2000 Arkless tried to become the oldest woman to ascend Mount Everest but failed {{when she had to}} abandon her attempt at 8,500m (28,000ft) due to severe altitude sickness. The experience left her disillusioned: [...] "Everest is full of non-climbers and rich people. Everest is all about summit fever and people who shouldn't be where they are. One <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> 'How many 8000m peaks have you climbed?' When I said 'One', he turned away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
