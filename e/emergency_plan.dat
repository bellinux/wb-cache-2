5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an <b>emergency</b> <b>plan,</b> and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Objectives A {{cross-sectional}} {{investigation was}} designed to assess the quality of local government plans for public health emergencies and to determine whether relevant regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are in place. Methods Sixty-six municipalities were selected randomly using stratified sampling, and a questionnaire investigation on <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> was conducted in these municipalities. Results The findings show that approximately 50 % of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> omitted important content; less than 50 % of municipalities had established three regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Conclusions Based on the analysis, the quality of existing public health <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> is not sufficient. More than 50 % of municipalities lack regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Suggestions regarding the responsibility of government at different levels are made. First, central government should draw up a set of standard development procedures and a standard template for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Secondly, local governments should revise their plans. Thirdly, local govern-ments should establish regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> as soon as possible...|$|R

Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E

5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, {{but they could not}} be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E

40|$|In {{the event}} of a {{disaster}} in Germany a so-called executive staff is set up. In support of their work they refer to <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> which describe the chronological order of a set of suitable measures for a dedicated event e. g. an evacuation. These plans only exist in the form of large printed documents. Hence, the technical support for executing <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> is very limited. In this paper we present a model for a workflow management system (WfMS) for supporting the modeling, execution and management of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> before and during a disaster. It is {{based on the idea that}} <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are similar to business processes and can therefore be modeled as workflows. In contrast to most traditional WfMS, the introduced approach supports unstructured activities and their delegation as well as the management of resources. Furthermore, we analyze drawbacks of the current process for disaster management using <b>emergency</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{response}} combines with {{prevention and}} mitigation {{to form the}} risk management triad of control measures for reducing chemical accident risks. In fact, standard good practice dictates that appropriate emergency response measures are identified for every major accident scenario of a hazardous operation. Consistent with this philosophy, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> has been taken on board as {{an essential component of}} the Seveso Directive since its inception in 1982. Within the current Seveso Directive (2012 / 18 /EU), under Article 12, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> for upper-tier sites is assigned as a direct obligation to both the operator (for internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning)</b> and the authorities (for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning).</b> These obligations present considerable challenges for the authorities, in particular, in verifying that internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> of each upper tier site is conducted in accordance with Seveso requirements and existing performance standard; that a parallel process for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> is established; and an appropriate strategy is defined to inform populations potentially at risk from the accident scenarios of concern. To bring improvements and consistency to Member State practices in this regard, the European Commission and the Irish Health and Safety Authority organised a workshop in 2012 for Seveso inspectors from EU and aligned countries to exchange information on challenges and successes in implementing <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> obligations. This publication summarizes the main conclusions and observations from the workshop discussions. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R
