40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} marketing of vegetable seed in private sector as well as public sector in five selected areas of Bangladesh. Besides for traders` survey apart from above mentioned areas Mymensingh town and Dhaka city were selected. Three types of respondents, such as vegetable growers, seed traders and seed importers/producers were interviewed {{with the help of}} pretested questionnaire during January to April, 1998. 50 % of the seeds used were either retained by farmers from previous seasons or purchased from other farmers. Traders handled 48 per cent of the seed and the remaining two per cent was marketed by public sector. <b>Importers</b> and <b>traders</b> purchased seed at Tk. 502190. 47 and 140913. 33 per quintal, respectively. The production cost of seed producing farm was Tk. 162236. 84. Seed was sold by <b>importers,</b> <b>traders</b> and producing farms at Tk. 590790. 47, 157836. 66 and Tk. 212052. 63 per quintal, respectively. So the gross return <b>of</b> <b>importers,</b> <b>traders</b> and seed producing farms were Tk. 88600. 00, 16923. 33 and Tk. 49815. 79 per quintal, respectively. Their marketing costs were Tk. 1177. 45, 719. 48 and Tk. 353. 04 respectively and net returns were Tk. 87422. 55, Tk. 16203. 85 and Tk. 49462. 75 respectively. The problems in vegetable production were: adulteration of seed, low germination of seed, problem of collecting import permit, lack of capital, problem of collecting clearing permit, lack of technological facilities, non-availability of experienced farmer and lack of modern storage facilities. To solve the above problems, the respondents suggested for ensuring the supply of required quality of seed in appropriate time at reasonable price, provision for Bank loan, improving Banking procedure, providing training facilities to the farmers, paying reasonable wage to farmers and development of storage facility...|$|R
40|$|Although the GATT prohibits discriminatory import tari s, it {{includes}} means for circumventing this prohibition. The previous literature uses static models and discriminatory tari s increase welfare. In a dynamic model, if governments lack {{the ability to}} precommit, {{this is not necessarily}} true. For example, with consumer switching costs, tari s are higher for rms with higher market share. Rationally expecting such policies, rms price less aggressively. If switching costs are signi cant relative to asymmetries, then higher prices can result in lower importing country welfare. Thus it may be in <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>importers</b> to abide by the GATT MFN principle...|$|R
40|$|Although the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs prohibits discriminatory import tariffs, GATT rules include {{means by}} which this {{prohibition}} can be circumvented. The previous literature use static models to show that discriminatory tariffs increase welfare. In a dynamic model, {{this is not necessarily}} true. For example, with consumer switching costs, current market share is valuable. In this case, discriminatory tariffs are higher for firms with a higher market share. In expectation of such policies, firms price less aggressively. If switching costs are significant relative to exporting country asymmetries then this adverse affect on incentives can result in lower importing country welfare. This suggests that it might be in the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>importers</b> to abide by the GATT MFN principle...|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{bovine animals}} are {{valuable}} resources to Filipinos {{because they are}} used as work animals and food source. Filipino farmers depend on water buffalos or carabaos for farm work. They consider the carabao as their beast of burden because it helps them till the lands. Cattle, like carabaos are also domesticated in the Philippines because they serve as important sources of meat and means of transport. Surely, Filipinos have a great need for domestic animals because they serve as sources of meat and milk and assist in agricultural-related activities. However, disaster struck the domestic bovine animals in the Philippines when carabaos and cattle were decimated by dangerous contagions during the American Period. The death of {{thousands and thousands of}} carabaos and cattle due to foot-and-mouth disease, cattle plague, bovine anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia affected the livelihood of many Filipino farmers and the business <b>of</b> cattle <b>importers</b> and local cattle raisers. This paper examines the impact of the animal disease problem to the Filipino farmers’ economic livelihood. It will also analyse and explain how this agricultural menace affected the country’s cattle industry as well as the business <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> many cattle <b>importers</b> and cattle raisers in the Philippines...|$|R

60|$|The {{report of}} the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made {{directly}} to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out {{for each of the}} Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice <b>of</b> the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> honest <b>importers</b> and taxpayers.|$|R

40|$|Latvia {{is a new}} European Union country, with 20 -year {{experience}} in the efforts to develop the energy policy that would favour reliable supply of the state with energy and promote its effective and rational utilization. The energy law should {{take into consideration the}} technological progress and increasing energy consumption as well as the poorly regulated sphere of production and utilization. At present, new regulations are needed, as the existent ones have become outdated and unable to ensure stable development of the energy sector. However, the lack of experience and sometimes external influence could lead to a situation when the new law would not be conducive to the industrial development but vice-versa − would slow it down. Since Latvia has been confronted by counterproductive laws, it is highly important to estimate beforehand the future impact of legislation on the state economy. On issues of the day for our country is now to guarantee − by force of law − the optimal share of renewable energy in the national energy mix. The objective set within the framework of European Union policy is to achieve a 40 % share of renewable energy by 2020; therefore, it is necessary to work out a separate law concerning the renewable energy sources (RES). The new RES law is to regulate support and to promote increase in the share of renewables. However, there are many influencing factors – not clearly specified outlooks for the energy sector and national economy development, the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>importers,</b> lobbying, etc.; these factors can make the RES law not only ineffective but even negatively affecting the RES share stability in the state energy balance. It is therefore essential, before the law has been adopted, to thoroughly analyze it so that the optimal variant is accepted...|$|R

For some supply chains, like for soy and its derived products {{that are used in}} the production of feed, manufacturers have to face both non-GM and GM production, although there are no labeling requirements for animal products derived from animals fed with GMOs. This study presents the strategies of stakeholders involved in the feed production chain to maintain concurrent production of compound feed with GM and non-GM soy products, by dealing with the coexistence between those two crops. The stakeholders include <b>importers,</b> <b>traders,</b> soy processors, feed processors and retailers. The study shows that many tools are in place to ensure andmaintain the current coexistence.
