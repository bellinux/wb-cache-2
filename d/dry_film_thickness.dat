5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this intumescent coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (<b>dry</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness)</b> a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E

40|$|Intumescent coating fire {{protection}} on steel structures is becoming widely {{popular in the}} UK and Europe. The current assessment for the {{fire protection}} performance method using the standard fire resistance tests is not accurate, owing to the reactive behaviour of intumescent coating at elevated temperature. Moreover, the available intumescent coating temperature assessment method provided in the Eurocode for structural steel at elevated temperature does not incorporate the steel beam's behaviour and/or assessment for partial protection and/or damaged protection. The research work presented provides additional information. on the assessment of partial and/or damaged intumescent coating at elevated temperature. In {{the scope of the}} investigation on the thermal conductivity of intumescent coating, {{it was found that the}} computed average thermal conductivity was marginally sensitive to the density and emissivity at elevated temperature. However, the thermal conductivity was found to be reasonably sensitive to the differences in initial dft's (<b>dry</b> <b>film</b> <b>thicknesses).</b> In this research, a numerical model was developed using ABAQUS to mimic actual indicative test scenarios to predict and establish the temperature distribution and the structural fire resistance of partial and/or damaged intumescent coating at elevated temperatures. Intumescent coating actively shields when the charring process occurs when the surface temperature reaches approximately 250 °C to 350 °C. Maximum deflection and deflection failure times for each damage scenario were analyzed by applying specified loading conditions. It was also found that the structural fire resistance failure mode of intumescent coating on protected steel beams was particularly sensitive to the applied boundary conditions. Careful selection of nodes in the element was necessary to avoid numerical instability and unexpected numerical error during analysis. An assessment of various numerical models subjected to a-standard fire with partially protected 1 mm intumescent coating was analysed using ABAQUS. An available unprotected test result was used as a benchmark. The outcome suggests that the fire resistances of the beams were found to be sensitive to the location of the partial and/or damage protection. The overall fire resistance behaviour of intumescent coating at elevated temperature was summarized in a 'typical deflection regression' curve. An extensive parametric analysis was performed on localized intumescent coating damage with various intumescent coating thicknesses between 0. 5 mm to 2. 0 mm. It was found that the average deflection was linear for the first 30 mins of exposure for all the variables, damage locations and intumescent thicknesses. It was concluded that a thicker layered intumescent coating may not be a better insulator or be compared to a much less thick intumescent coating at elevated temperature. The use of passive fire protection, however, does enhance the overall fire resistance of the steel beam, in contrast to a naked steel structure. The research work investigated the intumescent coating behaviour with different aspects of protection and damage and the outcome of the assessment provided a robust guide and additional understanding of the performance of intumescent coating at elevated temperature.

The grease <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> at very low speed is thicker than the base oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> due to {{the contribution of the}} thickener in this regime, which practically vanishes at higher speeds. The (mechanical) aging process reduces the thickener material, decreasing the grease <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> at very low speeds (entrainment speed less than 0. 01 m/s) with aging time, whereas no significant difference was found at higher speeds where the grease <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> still approached the calculated base oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} {{lubricating greases}} and their bleed and base oils were compared {{in terms of}} <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> in a ball-on-disc test rig through optical interferometry. The theoretical values calculated according to Hamrock's equation are {{in close agreement with}} the base oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> measurements, which validates the selected experimental methodology. The grease and bleed oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> under fully flooded lubrication conditions presented quite similar behaviour and levels. Therefore, the grease <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> under full <b>film</b> conditions might be predicted using their bleed oil properties, namely the viscosity and pressure-viscosity coefficient. The base and bleed oil lubricant parameter LP are proportional to the measured <b>film</b> <b>thickness.</b> A relationship between grease and the corresponding bleed oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> was evidenced...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to predict the mean liquid <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> and profile at high shear stress using a mechanistic approach. Knowledge of the liquid <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> and its variation with two-phase flow parameters is critical for the estimation of safety parameters in the annular flow regime. The mean liquid <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> and profile were predicted by the PLIFT code designed in Fortran 95 programming language using the PLATO FTN 95 compiler. The <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> was predicted within the annular flow regime for a flow boiling quality ranging from 40 to 80 % at high interfacial shear stress. Results obtained for a laminar liquid film flow were dumped into an excel file when the ratio of the actual predicted <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> to the critical liquid <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> lied within the range of 0. 9 to unity. The <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> was observed to decrease towards the exit of the annular regime at high flow boiling qualities and void fractions. The observation confirmed the effect of evaporation in decreasing the <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> as quality is increased towards the exit of the annular regime...|$|R
