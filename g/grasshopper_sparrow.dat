Both of these birds were abundant in Illinois, but their populations have been declining due to {{loss of the}} grasslands. This begins an ongoing study of the birds’ habitat so Fermilab can develop a land management plan for the Henslow’s and Grasshoppers. The Henslow’s were found at ten sites and Grasshoppers at eight sites. Once the birds were located, the vegetation at their sites was studied. Measurements of the maximum plant height, average plant height, and duff height were taken and estimates of the percent of grass, forbs, duff, and bare ground were recorded for each square meter studied. The same measurements were taken at ten random grassland sites on Fermilab property. Several t-tests were performed on the data, and {{it was found that}} both Henslow’s <b>Sparrows</b> and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> preferred areas with a larger percentage of grass than random areas.

40|$|Master of ScienceBiologyAlice BoyleDispersal is a {{behavior}} common to virtually all taxa with important consequences for gene flow, demography, and conservation. Mobile {{animals such as}} birds frequently engage in breeding dispersal, but the factors shaping this behavior are not well understood. In mid-continental grasslands, preliminary evidence suggested that <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus savannarum) engaged in breeding dispersal within a single breeding season. This intriguing pattern shaped my research questions: (1) what are the patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows?</b> (2) why do some individual sparrows disperse, and others do not? and (3) what shapes settlement decisions following dispersal? I tested hypotheses based on spatial and temporal variation in nest predation, nest parasitism, and food availability. I studied <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> at 18 experimentally-managed watersheds with different fire and grazing regimes at Konza Prairie Biological Station during 2013 - 2015. To describe patterns, I combined re-sighting of 779 marked individuals, territory mapping, and radio-telemetry to quantify territory densities, turnover, and dispersal distances. To determine if nest predation or nest parasitism affected dispersal, I monitored the fate of 223 nests. I estimated food intake rates using plasma metabolites, and prey availability using sweep sampling. Densities of territorial <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> varied seasonally in management-specific ways. Turnover was remarkably high, with over half of territorial males being replaced each month. Over a third of males changed territories within-season, dispersing 0. 1 - 9 km between breeding attempts. Dispersal decisions were related to past nest predation, but not nest parasitism. Dispersal likely yields fitness benefits, as sparrows that dispersed increased their chances of nest survival by 23 % relative to site-faithful individuals. However, food availability did not affect settlement decisions. My study provides the first evidence of within-season breeding dispersal in <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> and represents one of few tests of alternative hypotheses explaining dispersal decisions of songbirds. My {{results are consistent with}} a growing literature on the role of predation shaping dispersal, but suggest, somewhat surprisingly, that food is not important in post-dispersal habitat selection. High dispersal capacity coupled with adaptability to temporal and spatial change may be typical of grassland songbirds, implying that demographic studies and management decisions must consider their mobility for conservation...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{an index}} of reproductive success based on breeding behavior to actual nest fates of <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Ammodramus savannarum) and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) on 12 plots (4 -ha). Concordance of results between the two methods was 58 % for <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> and 42 % for eastern meadowlarks on a plot-by-plot basis. The indirect method yielded higher estimates of reproductive activity than nest monitoring for {{the balance of the}} plots,. There was little evidence that brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism influenced the estimates of reproductive success using the indirect method. We concluded that nests and about-to-fledge nestlings were missed during searches on some plots. It may be appropriate to use an indirect method to more efficiently survey territories and/or plots for species with hard-to-find nests or when monitoring large areas. Use of a reproductive index may be appropriate and more time-efficient than nest searching and monitoring for comparing management effects such as burning, grazing, haying, military training, and other localized disturbances that are likely to affect reproductive success of <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> and eastern meadowlarks. However, nest monitoring may be necessary for more precise estimates of productivity necessary for long-term monitoring. Nest monitoring results are also likely to allow for direct comparisons to results from other studies because the index method requires intimate knowledge of the species being evaluated - a factor that could lead to reduced precision because the experience level of technicians relying only on behavioral cues from study-to-study is likely to vary considerably...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a major}} cause of population decline in grassland birds. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of area and shape determines the use of grassland patches by breeding birds. We compared both species richness and individual species presence in 45 wet meadow grasslands in the floodplain of the central Platte River, Nebraska. Bird data were collected through the use of belt transects and supplemented by walking and listening outside transects. Our data supported our primary hypothesis that perimeter–area ratio, which reflects both the area and shape of a patch, is the strongest predictor of both individual species presence and overall species richness. The probability of occurrence for all six common species (<b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> Bobolinks, Upland Sandpipers, Western Meadowlarks, Dickcissels, and Red-winged Blackbirds) was significantly inversely correlated with perimeter–area ratio. The probability of occurrence of <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> Bobolinks, Upland Sandpipers, and Western Meadowlarks was also correlated with area.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} four year field {{study on the}} movement patterns, community dynamics, and management of granivorous wintering grassland sparrows in Arizona. Chapter one focuses on within winter, local scale movement patterns. Recapture statistics and radiotelemetry both showed strong interspecific differences in movement, {{consistent with the idea}} that these species may partition niche space according to the regional coexistence mechanism. Both techniques ranked species from most to least sedentary as follows: Cassin's and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows,</b> Baird's, Vesper, and Savannah and Brewer's sparrows. Data also indicated that fixed home range movements, and within-species constancy of movement behavior across years and study sites are generally the rule in this group. Correlations between bird abundance and summer rainfall suggest that movement may constrain large scale habitat selection processes. Chapter two presents larger scale movement data from grassland sparrows, along with a general discussion of facultative migration in birds. High between-year abundance fluctuations and low and variable rates of between-year recapture suggest that facultative migration strategies may be the rule in grassland sparrows. The use of alternative wintering sites by individual <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> provides direct evidence of limited facultative migration behavior. These patterns contrast with the largely non-facultative migration strategies that are the rule in birds. The evolution of facultative migration strategies is linked with unpredictable temporal variation in the spatial distribution of habitat conditions in the landscape. Chapter three presents three years of data on the effects of spring/summer burning and cattle grazing on wintering grassland sparrows. Vesper and Savannah sparrows responded positively to fire, while Cassin's Sparrows responded negatively. The ecologically and geographically restricted Baird's and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> utilized burned areas during the first post-bum winter and did not significantly respond to fire. Both Ammodramus sparrows also utilized the grazed pasture; they were more abundant there than in the ungrazed study area in one year. While field observations and a prior study suggest that heavy grazing can have a strong detrimental effect on Ammodramus sparrows, {{the results of this study}} suggest that moderate cattle grazing may be compatible with the conservation of these species...|$|R
40|$|Conservationists and {{managers}} mention grassland restorations as a conservation strategy {{to reverse the}} decline of grassland bird populations in the Great Plains. In the Rainwater Basin Region of southcentral Nebraska, state and federal resource agencies have used grassland restorations to protect wetlands from sedimentation and agrichemical runoff. These grassland restorations may also provide important habitat for breeding grassland birds. In this paper, we describe the abundance, composition, nesting success, and habitat requirements of breeding birds in grassland restorations in the Rainwater Basin Region. We observed 14 grassland bird species in 12 grassland restorations. The most abundant species were dickcissels (Spiza americana), <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Ammodramus savannarum), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). We found a total of 84 nests composed of II species in restorations. Dickcissels and <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> accounted for 77 % of all nests found. Nest success was 31 % (26 nests), and the major cause of nest loss was predation, which accounted for 66 % (38 nests) of all nest failures.

40|$|More {{accurate}} {{estimates of}} survival after nestlings fledge {{are needed for}} population models to be parameterized and population dynamics to be understood during this vulnerable life stage. The period after fledging {{is the time when}} chicks learn to fly, forage, and hide from predators. We monitored postfledging survival, causespecific mortality, and movements of <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus savannarum) in grassland managed with fire and grazing. In 2009, we attached radio transmitters to 50 nestlings from 50 different broods and modeled their survival in response to climatic, biological, and ecological variables. There was no effect of treatment on survival. The factor most influencing postfledging survival was age; no other variable was significant. The majority of chicks (74 %) died within 3 days of radio-transmitter attachment. We attributed most mortality to mesopredators (48 %) and exposure (28 %). Fledglings’ movements increased rapidly for the first 4 days after they left the nest and were relatively stable for the remaining 10 days we tracked them. On average, fledglings took flight for the first time 4 days after fledging and flew 10 m 9 days after fledging. Our data show that the <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrow’s</b> survival rates may be less than most models relying on nest-success estimates predict, and we emphasize the importance of incorporating estimates of survival during the postfledging period in demographic models...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyBrett K. SandercockGrassland {{birds are}} declining {{throughout}} their native range. The Flint Hills of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma contain {{large tracts of}} tallgrass prairie, but intensification of agricultural practices may be contributing to ongoing population declines. Common rangeland management practices include annual burning coupled with heavy grazing by cattle. This system, known as intensive early stocking and burning, promotes homogeneous utilization of forage by cattle but may not provide habitat for some grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative management system that aims to restore heterogeneity on rangelands by recreating the fire-grazing interaction that would have historically occurred throughout the Great Plains. From 2011 - 2013, we examined responses of grassland birds to traditional rangeland management and patch-burn grazing by conducting vegetation surveys, line transect surveys, and nest monitoring on privately-owned pastures in Chase County and Greenwood County, Kansas. Vegetative heterogeneity was higher on patch-burned pastures, with unburned patches having higher visual obstruction and less bare ground. Densities of grassland birds differed by species and among habitat strata. Unburned patches on patch-burned pastures were associated with increased densities of Dickcissels (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus savannarum). Henslow’s Sparrows (A. henslowii) were only detected on patch-burned pastures. Nest survival of grassland songbirds was similar among management systems but varied by year. Probability of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) varied among years and between treatments for Dickcissels and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> with overall lower rates on burned areas and during drought years. For Dickcissels and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> {{there was a significant}} reduction in host clutch size between parasitized versus unparasitized nests. Overall, nest survival of grassland songbirds in managed rangelands was low. Patch-burn grazing improved rangeland conditions and provided habitat for more species of birds, but did not increase nest survival. Drought conditions in 2012 and 2013 may have influenced the results of this study, as many landowners were unable to burn as planned. Further study is needed to determine underlying factors driving variation in nest success and parasitism rates for grassland birds, particularly on private lands which make up the vast majority of remnant tallgrass prairies...|$|R
50|$|As of 2017, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 50-60 Florida <b>grasshopper</b> <b>sparrows</b> left in the wild. This shows a dramatic decline from 2004, when population estimates were 1,000.
