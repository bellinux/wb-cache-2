5000|$|The 1907 {{steam engine}} was by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw. It was {{built as a}} triple {{expansion}} at 1200 hp. It was altered in 1921 and became a 1500 hp vertical three cylinder compound engine. The later engine had a 28" [...] diameter high pressure (HP) in the centre, with a 33" [...] IP and 51"LP cylinder. It had a 4 ft stroke and ran at 78rpm. The boiler operated at 170psi. The 22 ft flywheel was mounted at end of shaft, <b>driving</b> 28 <b>ropes.</b> There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. Air pumps were driven from LP and IP crossheads.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevated}} version first {{sees the}} attacking wrestler raise an opponent off the ground, often using a suplex lift, {{to place the}} opponent's leg on the top ring rope {{so that they are}} face-down while the wrestler holds them in a front facelock, keeping their heads side by side under each other shoulder, making the wrestler the only other thing than the ring ropes keeping the opponent off the ground. At this point the attacking wrestler swings inward as they dive to the ground, twisting on the opponent's neck and in the process lifting the opponent's entire body off the <b>rope,</b> <b>driving</b> their neck and shoulders into the ground. A double team version of this move also exists.|$|R
40|$|Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), {{a kind of}} {{energetic}} solar eruptions, are {{an integral}} subject of space weather research. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling, which requires powerful computational resources, {{is one of the}} primary means of studying the phenomenon. With increasing accessibility of such resources, grows the demand for user-friendly tools that would facilitate the process of simulating CMEs for scientific and operational purposes. The Eruptive Event Generator based on Gibson-Low flux rope (EEGGL), a new publicly available computational model presented in this paper, is an effort to meet this demand. EEGGL allows one to compute the parameters of a model flux <b>rope</b> <b>driving</b> a CME via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). We provide a brief overview of the physical principles behind EEGGL and its functionality. Ways towards future improvements of the tool are outlined...|$|R
30|$|We {{normally}} start {{increment borer}} by pushing the electric wrench {{and the reaction}} bar to insert the threaded part (the first 3  cm of the tip). When two persons are available, we tilt the reaction bar in horizontal direction, so that each person can push the left or {{the right side of}} the reaction bar. By pressing the cutting edge of the bit against the stem with stronger pressure, we can start the 12  mm borer more easily. However, roughness and thickness of the stem bark often make it difficult to get the borer bit to start engaging, especially when a small and/or inexperienced person tries to start a 12  mm borer on hardwood alone. To solve this problem, we designed a motor-driven socket that can also serve as a winching machine (Fig.  2 g, winch socket). A rope is wrapped around the circumference of the tree trunk, and then put through the eyelets of the winch socket (Fig.  2 top left). After pulling both ends tight, we tie a bow knot to make a loop. Once the winch socket starts <b>driving,</b> the <b>rope</b> winds around the bit until taut and presses the cutting edge of the bit against the stem surface, forcing the bit into the stem (Fig.  2 h, top left). After the threaded part goes inside the stem and fully engages with wood, the rope is untied and removed to continue coring.|$|R
40|$|Hα {{observations}} of solar active region NOAA 10501 on 2003 November 20 revealed a very uncommon dynamic process: {{during the development}} of a nearby flare, two adjacent elongated filaments approached each other, merged at their middle sections, and separated again, thereby forming stable configurations with new footpoint connections. The observed dynamic pattern is indicative of "slingshot" reconnection between two magnetic flux ropes. We test this scenario by means of a three-dimensional zero β magnetohydrodynamic simulation, using {{a modified version of the}} coronal flux rope model by Titov and Démoulin as the initial condition for the magnetic field. To this end, a configuration is constructed that contains two flux ropes which are oriented side-by-side and are embedded in an ambient potential field. The choice of the magnetic orientation of the flux ropes and of the topology of the potential field is guided by the observations. Quasi-static boundary flows are then imposed to bring the middle sections of the flux ropes into contact. After sufficient <b>driving,</b> the <b>ropes</b> reconnect and two new flux ropes are formed, which now connect the former adjacent flux rope footpoints of opposite polarity. The corresponding evolution of filament material is modeled by calculating the positions of field line dips at all times. The dips follow the morphological evolution of the flux ropes, in qualitative agreement with the observed filaments. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. Printed in the U.

50|$|Driven by a 900 hp {{inverted}} vertical triple expansion engine by J & E Wood, 1907. It had a 14/16 ft flywheel with 20 ropes, {{operating at}} 94 rpm. The original three Tetlow boilers still supplied steam at 180psi, when in 1961 electric drives were installed. Watkins records: The Lancashire Cotton Corporation, Royd Mill, Hollinwood. Cotton Spinning. Royd, built in 1907, {{was one of}} the smaller mills, the engine built by J & E Wood of Bolton developing 900 hp. The cylinders, of 18.5, 28.5, and 43in bore by 3 ft 6in stroke, were all fitted with Corliss-valves, which in contrast to the maker's usual practice were fitted at the opposite sides of the cylinders. It ran at 94rpm, <b>driving</b> by 20 <b>ropes</b> from a 14 ft flywheel. The original three Tetlow boilers still supplied steam at 180psi, when by 1961 electric drives were installed, and the engine was scrapped. The frame was unusual since there were only two columns in front, with twin feet to the single casting bed, the intermediate cylinder being supported by a massive cross casting.|$|R
