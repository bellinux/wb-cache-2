5000|$|The media quoted some of Hancock's former Council of Europe's liberal group colleagues {{as saying}} that in the 2000s Hancock would usually come to their regular private gatherings {{alongside}} a series of young Russian and Ukrainian women - in spite of protests by some of those; Hancock's former colleagues said they had witnessed his assistants using the computers of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the liberal <b>group</b> <b>secretariat,</b> which {{were supposed to be}} protected by a password; apparently his assistants knew the password. Hancock denied claims by Mátyás Eörsi that he had failed to declare all of his visits to Russia, saying {{that he did not know}} exactly how many trips he had made to Russia, as his passport had [...] "fallen into the sea".

40|$|The {{head of the}} 2011 United Nations High Level Meeting on AIDS, the Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and Injecting Drug Use {{has issued}} a {{statement}} calling for Member States to focus on HIV transmission among people who inject drugs. The statement details eight key priorities for Member States as they negotiate the outcome document for June’s General Assembly meeting. “Harm reduction is neither a matter of rhetoric, nor of politics. It is evidence-based and when implemented to scale, reduces HIV transmission among people who inject drugs,” says Bronwyn Myers, Reference <b>Group</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and Specialist Scientist at the Medical Research Council. The statement issued by the Reference Group asks governments to commit to scaling-up evidence-based interventions to addressing HIV among people who inject drugs. It details a rights-based public health approach to achieving universal access, such as providing anti-retroviral treatment {{to people who are}} living with HIV, and it calls for countries to revise punitive drug and law enforcement policies that can undermine the AIDS response and human rights. “There is still a misconception that people who use drugs can not adhere to HIV treatment regimens, but research shows that they adhere well, especially if HIV treatment is offered in conjunction with drug treatment,” said Steffanie Strathdee, Associate Dean of Global Health at UC San Diego {{and a member of the}} Reference Group. “Denying drug users life-saving HIV treatments and drug treatment violates their right to health and harms the community, since it is now known that HIV treatment reduces viral load and can prevent HIV transmission,” Dr Strathdee said...|$|E

40|$|Background Since many {{trials are}} small, {{systematic}} reviews {{are essential for}} obtaining statistically reliable results. However, some trials are better-reported than others. Non-publication or delayed publication could lead to bias in a review. We identify trial characteristics affecting how quickly or widely results of randomized trials are reported, and hence how likely the trial {{is to be found}} by reviewers. Methods We analyzed all randomized trials in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia that began before 1988 and all articles for these trials published before 2000, as identified by the Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) Collaborative <b>Group</b> <b>secretariat.</b> This was the set of 149 trials included in the Second International Collaborative Workshop on Childhood ALL Studies at the end of 1992, comprising 243 randomized comparisons. We used multiple linear regression to analyze time to first mention or to first reporting of results (time to publication), logistic regression for whether a randomization was ever mentioned or reported, and Poisson regression for frequency of mentions or publications. Results Collectively, the articles mentioned 217 randomizations, with results reported for 188. Highly statistically significant results were published faster, each tenfold reduction in the p-value (e. g., going from 0. 5 to 0. 05 or from 0. 05 to 0. 005) resulting in publication on average 20 months earlier (95 % confidence interval 6 - 34, p= 0. 005), non-statistically significant results from trials outside North America and Europe took on average 55 months longer than those without these characteristics (95 % CI 22 - 88, p= 0. 001), and results from trials in high income countries were more likely to reach publication at some point than were results from other countries (odds ratio 7. 8, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 25. 3, p= 0. 0006). Randomizations in high income countries were mentioned 73 months earlier than those in middle or low income countries (95 % CI 51 - 94, p Conclusions Systematic reviewers should not rely solely on published reports, but should use additional ways of finding trials in order to minimize biases related to results and other trial characteristics. This relates both to published reports of trial results and to mentions of trials in the literature. This is the accepted version of the following article: [BURRETT, J. A. & LUNN, D. 2011.

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{the work}} of Bailer and colleagues (2009) and it seeks to apply two sociological {{theories}} on the effects of group size - oligarchization and formalization - to political Groups in the European Parliament. On the basis of these theories, the substantial expansion in the membership of the political Groups which resulted from the ‘Big Bang’ enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe is expected to bear two consequences for their organizations: their chief organs (Bureau and/or Presidency) will become more powerful and their bureaucratic structure will expand and become more complex. Empirically, this paper makes a qualitative comparison of the internal organization of the three largest political Groups (the Conservative EPP, the Socialists and the Liberals) before and after enlargement. It is based on original archival research in the political <b>Group</b> <b>secretariats</b> in Brussels and interviews with senior administrators and MEPs. By presenting an in-depth study of the Groups’ internal organizations, this paper contributes to the debate on the sources of voting cohesion in the EP...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{cross-border}} regions can be distinguished. First, they vary in geographic scope. Small-scale initiatives such as the EUREGIO can be distinguished from larger groupings, such as the 'Working Communities'. The latter - {{most of them were}} founded between 1975 and 1985 - usually comprise several regions forming large areas that can stretch over several nation states. Examples of Working Communities are the Arge Alp, the Alpes-Adria, the Working Community of the Western Alps (COTRAO), the Working Community of the Pyrenees or the Atlantic Arc. Their organizational structures usually consist of a general assembly, an executive committee, thematic working <b>groups</b> and <b>secretariats</b> (Aykaç, 1994: 12-14), but activities tend to be confined to common declarations and information exchange. However, some groupings, such as the Atlantic Arc, succeeded in obtaining European funds (Balme et al., 1996).|$|R
