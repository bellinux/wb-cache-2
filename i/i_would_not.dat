5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{could in}} the least {{palliate}} this long, this cold, this very distant separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge that I am preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the prise, I know no hardships that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> encounter with, to obtain it.|$|E

5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
5|$|We were {{informed}} of {{the prospect of a}} shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week. Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice. If now the idea came into his head to starve to death, then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> want to take away his right to ask all his fellow fighters to do the same.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase <b>I,</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E
25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not,</b> however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> wish to {{a dog or}} to a snake, to {{the most}} low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> wish {{to any of them}} what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E

6000|$|WHEELER. [Drawing the curtains.] That {{precious}} {{husband of}} yours was round for you after you'd gone yesterday, Mrs. Jones. Wanted your money for drink, I suppose. He hangs about the corner here half the time. I saw him outside the [...] "Goat and Bells" [...] when I {{went to the}} post last night. If I were you <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> live with him. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> live with a man that raised his hand to me. I wouldn't put up with it. Why don't you take your children and leave him? If you put up with 'im it'll only make him worse. I never can see why, because a man's married you, he should knock you about.|$|R

25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E

25|$|With county, road, {{and school}} taxes {{steadily}} mounting {{even in the}} grazing sections of Texas, {{there is very little}} inducement left for the cattleman to buy large ranches at the present prices. All farm land colonization companies have disbanded because {{there is no longer a}} chance for steady long time employment. Because of present-day conditions, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> take to organize a colonizing company, nor do I know anyone who could afford to do so except the large landowner who wishes to sell and colonize his own property exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> let my dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E
25|$|When I asked {{a friend}} who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one {{specific}} person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly {{for the past few}} weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> need his services.|$|E
