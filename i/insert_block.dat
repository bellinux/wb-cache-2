40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to present conceptual design phase thermal process calculations that support the process design and process safety basis for the cold vacuum drying of K Basin KOP material. This document is intended {{to demonstrate that the}} conceptual approach: (1) Represents a workable process design that is suitable for development in preliminary design; and (2) Will support formal safety documentation to be prepared during the definitive design phase to establish an acceptable safety basis. The Sludge Treatment Project (STP) is responsible for the disposition of Knock Out Pot (KOP) sludge within the 105 -K West (KW) Basin. KOP sludge consists of size segregated material (primarily canister particulate) from the fuel and scrap cleaning process used in the Spent Nuclear Fuel process at K Basin. The KOP sludge will be pre-treated to remove fines and some of the constituents containing chemically bound water, after which it is referred to as KOP material. The KOP material will then be loaded into a Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO), dried at the Cold Vacuum Drying Facility (CVDF) and stored in the Canister Storage Building (CSB). This process is patterned after the successful drying of 2100 metric tons of spent fuel, and uses the same facilities and much of the same equipment that was used for drying fuel and scrap. Table ES-l present similarities and differences between KOP material and fuel and between MCOs loaded with these materials. The potential content of bound water bearing constituents limits the mass ofKOP material in an MCO load to a fraction of that in an MCO containing fuel and scrap; however, the small particle size of the KOP material causes the surface area to be significantly higher. This relatively large reactive surface area represents an input to the KOP thermal calculations that is significantly different from the calculations for fuel MCOs. The conceptual design provides for a copper <b>insert</b> <b>block</b> that limits the volume available to receive KOP material, enhances heat conduction, and functions as a heat source and sink during drying operations. This use of the copper insert represents a significant change to the thermal model compared to that used for the fuel calculations. A number of cases were run representing a spectrum of normal and upset conditions for the drying process. Dozens of cases have been run on cold vacuum drying of fuel MCOs. Analysis of these previous calculations identified four cases that provide a solid basis for judgments on the behavior of MCO in drying operations. These four cases are: (1) Normal Process; (2) Degraded vacuum pumping; (3) Open MCO with loss of annulus water; and (4) Cool down after vacuum drying. The four cases were run for two sets of input parameters for KOP MCOs: (1) a set of parameters drawn from safety basis values from the technical data book and (2) a sensitivity set using parameters selected to evaluate the impact of lower void volume and smaller particle size on MCO behavior. Results of the calculations for the drying phase cases are shown in Table ES- 2. Cases using data book safety basis values showed dry out in 9. 7 hours and heat rejection sufficient to hold temperature rise to less than 25 C. Sensitivity cases which included unrealistically small particle sizes and corresponding high reactive surface area showed higher temperature increases that were limited by water consumption. In this document and in the attachment (Apthorpe, R. and M. G. Plys, 2010) cases using Technical Databook safety basis values are referred to as nominal cases. In future calculations such cases will be called safety basis cases. Also in these documents cases using parameters that are less favorable to acceptable performance than databook safety values are referred to as safety cases. In future calculations such cases will be called sensitivity cases or sensitivity evaluations Calculations to be performed in support of the detailed design and formal safety basis documentation will expand the calculations presented in this document to include: additional features of the drying cycle, more realistic treatment of uranium metal consumption during oxidation, larger water inventory, longer time scales, and graphing of results of hydrogen gas concentration...|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of <b>inserting</b> <b>blocking</b> screws, the {{proximal}} and distal fragments {{have to be considered}} individually. Factors contributing to the stability of bone–nail construct are stability at the nail entry site, a snugly fitting medullary canal, impaction of the nail tip into the metaphysis and the interlocking screws. When the osteotomy is done in the metaphysis, the nail is usually centered in the longer bone fragment and may not need blocking screws unless the IM canal is significantly wider than the nail at the osteotomy site. Screws can still be used in the longer fragment if stability is a concern. The shorter metaphyseal fragment has a wide medullary canal and is at risk of toggling around the nail and developing undesirable angulation. Accordingly, the shorter fragment frequently needs blocking screws for additional stability.|$|R

Standard operations are processed in batches under item availability, and each batch requires a set-up time.

Our approach yields efficient algorithms for the sum of completion times problem with agreeable processing times and the maximum lateness problem.

40|$|TrkC is a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} that binds neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) with high affinity. A number of naturally occurring splice variants of TrkC exist, including one (TrkC kil 4) with a 14 amino acid insertion between subdomains VII and VIII of the tyrosine kinase domain. This kinase <b>insert</b> <b>blocks</b> the ability of NT- 3 to stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells and proliferation in fibroblasts. The <b>inserts</b> also <b>block</b> the ability of TrkC to form a high-affinity complex with Shc and phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) and the activation of PtdIns 3 -kinase, and attenuates the sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In the current study {{we set out to}} determine whether the attenuation of the activation of MAPK by the insert {{was the result of the}} inability of TrkC to activate the Shc-Ras pathway, PtdIns 3 -kinase activation, PLC gamma activation, or a combination thereof. Experiments with the use of cell-permeant inhibitors argue against a major role for PLC gamma and PtdIns 3 -kinase in the activation of MAPK by TrkC. The introduction of the 14 amino acid kinase insert appeared to slow the kinetics of NT- 3 -stimulated Shc phosphorylation and Shc-Grb 2 association and reduce their magnitude; an effect which was associated with a delayed, and only transient, activation of MAPK. Taken together, our data suggest that the apparent defect in MAPK activation caused by the kinase insert may result predominantly from an inhibition of high-affinity Shc binding, although a role for PLC gamma and PtdIns 3 -kinase cannot be completely excluded...|$|R

One of the cDNAs is essentially {{identical to the}} cDNA cloned by Andreone, Printz, Pilkis, Magnuson & Granner. [(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 363 - 369]. The other cDNA contains a 151 bp insertion and a downstream 52 bp deletion.

Next there is a novel polypeptide sequence of 87 residues, comprising 50 residues encoded by the cassette exon and 37 residues specified by an altered reading frame in exon 2. Due to the 52 bp deletion, 17 amino acids of the reference sequence are then missing, after which the sequence reverts to the original. Northern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes has shown that alternatively spliced mRNA represents about 5 % of total glucokinase mRNA. Alternative splicing of glucokinase mRNA in liver may explain earlier findings of minor isoforms of hepatic glucokinase...|$|R

25|$|Hokusai paid close {{attention}} to the production of his work in books. Two instances are documented in letters he wrote to the publishers and blockcutters involved in the production of his designs in Toshisen Ehon, a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry. Hokusai writes to the book’s publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai’s style in the cutting of certain heads. Hokusai also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa-school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure’s eyes and noses and that amendments would need to be made for the final prints to be true to Hokusai’s style. In his letter Hokusai includes illustrated examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses, and the Utagawa–school style. The publisher agreed to make these alterations, even with hundreds of copies of the book already printed. To correct these details the already existing cut blocks would be corrected by use of the umeki technique. The sections to be corrected would be removed and a prepared piece of wood inserted, into which the blockcutter would cut the revised design. Use of the umeki technique can be detected by fine break marks bordering the <b>inserted</b> <b>block.</b> Copies in print of both the original woodblock and those made of Hokusai’s requested revisions survive, printed in 1833 and 1836 respectively.|$|R
40|$|Consider two random strings {{having the}} same length and {{generated}} by an iid sequence taking its values uniformly in a fixed finite alphabet. Artificially place a long constant block {{into one of the}} strings, where a constant block is a contiguous substring consisting only of one type of symbol. The long block replaces a segment of equal size and its length is smaller than the length of the strings, but larger than its square-root. We show that for sufficiently long strings the optimal alignment corresponding to a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) treats the <b>inserted</b> <b>block</b> very differently {{depending on the size of}} the alphabet. For two-letter alphabets, the long constant block gets mainly aligned with the same symbol from the other string, while for three or more letters the opposite is true and the block gets mainly aligned with gaps. We further provide simulation results on the proportion of gaps in blocks of various lengths. In our simulations, the blocks are "regular blocks" in an iid sequence, and are not artificially inserted. Nonetheless, we observe for these natural blocks a phenomenon similar to the one shown in case of artificially-inserted blocks: with two letters, the long blocks get aligned with a smaller proportion of gaps; for three or more letters, the opposite is true. It thus appears that the microscopic nature of two-letter optimal alignments and three-letter optimal alignments are entirely different from each other.

40|$|International audienceActivation of Raf- 1 {{suppresses}} integrin activation, potentially {{through the}} activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2). However, bulk ERK 1 / 2 activation does not correlate with suppression. PEA- 15 reverses suppression of integrin activation and binds ERK 1 / 2. Here {{we report that}} PEA- 15 reversal of integrin suppression depends on its capacity to bind ERK 1 / 2, indicating that ERK 1 / 2 function is indeed required for suppression. Mutations in either the death effector domain or C-terminal tail of PEA- 15 that block ERK 1 / 2 binding abrogated the reversal of integrin suppression. Furthermore, we used ERK/p 38 chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis to identify ERK 1 / 2 residues required for binding PEA- 15. Mutations of residues that precede the alphaG helix and within the mitogen-activated protein kinase <b>insert</b> <b>blocked</b> ERK 2 binding to PEA- 15, but not activation of ERK 2. These ERK 2 mutants blocked the ability of PEA- 15 to reverse suppression of integrin activation. Thus, PEA- 15 regulation of integrin activation depends on its binding to ERK 1 / 2. To directly test the role of ERK 1 / 2 localization in suppression, we enforced membrane association of ERK 1 and 2 by joining a membrane-targeting CAAX box sequence to them. Both ERK 1 -CAAX and ERK 2 -CAAX were membrane-localized and suppressed integrin activation. In contrast to suppression by membrane-targeted Raf-CAAX, suppression by ERK 1 / 2 -CAAX was not reversed by PEA- 15. Thus, ERK 1 / 2 are the Raf effectors for suppression of integrin activation, and PEA- 15 reverses suppression by binding ERK 1 / 2...|$|R
