The primary objective is to verify the theoretically predicted extinction boundary, using oxygen percentage and flow velocity as coordinates. Of particular interest are the low-speed quenching limits and the existence of the critical oxygen flammability limit. Detailed flame spread characteristics, including flame spread rate, flame size, and flame structure are sought. Since the predicted flame behavior depends on the inclusion of flame and surface radiation, the measured results will also be used to assess the importance of radiative heat transfer by direct comparison to a comprehensive numerical model. The solid fuel used in this experiment is a custom-made fabric consisting of a 1 : 1 blend of cotton and fiberglass.

40|$|Among the {{alternative}} fuels, hydrogen shows great potential as fuel and energy carrier. The advantages of using hydrogen as fuel for {{internal combustion engine}} is amongst other a long-term renewable and less polluting fuel, non-toxic, odourless, and has wide <b>range</b> <b>flammability.</b> This thesis deals with the utilization of hydrogen as fuel for diesel engine under dual fuel operation. Hydrogen is mixed with air or injected in the intake manifold before entering combustion chamber. Small amount of diesel fuel is injected to promote ignition. A modified experimental setup based on a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine together with 3 D computational model was employed. The model incorporates detailed chemical kinetics for the oxidation of hydrogen and diesel fuel represented by the primary reference fuel consists of n-heptane and isooctane. During the combustion processes, the turbulence-chemistry interaction was accounted for. In the experimental part of this study, the effects of introducing hydrogen in varying flow rates on engine performance, combustion, and emission in the DI diesel engine were investigated. The corresponding results were further used to validate the simulation model. The simulation provides the mean calculation results and also the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, cylinder pressure, velocity, and species mass fractions which are key data for {{the interpretation of the}} combustion processes. Experimental results showed that hydrogen addition at certain flow rate gave a different influence on the combustion, depending on the amount of the pilot diesel fuel or the engine load. Hydrogen addition at the low load reduced the cylinder pressure. On the other hand, it increased the cylinder pressure at higher loads. Simulation revealed that for the same hydrogen flow rate, higher load resulted in a faster combustion and earlier start of ignition. Hydrogen percentage of about 70 % based on energy sharing would be the maximum amount for a good combustion efficiency and stability. In depth investigation by simulation showed that the burning of hydrogen-air mixtures essentially occurs around the regions {{in the vicinity of the}} spray with high temperature. When diesel fuel vapour reached its flammability limit at high temperature, the ignition started. Hydrogen-air mixture oxidized at some degree crank angle after the commencement of the ignition. Fast combustion was observed during the diesel oxidation. When most of pilot diesel fuel has been oxidized, the combustion became slower. Hydrogen-air mixture oxidation was mainly due to flame propagation until the end of expansion stroke. The amount of the hydrogen that can be converted into the combustion products seems to be defined by the amount of the diesel pilot fuel. Some valuable insight and new ideas were identified through the extensive experimental and numerical investigation into the diesel-hydrogen dual fuel engine. Incorporating a detailed pilot fuel injection model which can provide more accurate results for pilot injection, developing an improved kinetic model for dual fuel combustion processes with gaseous fuel as the main fuel, and developing an improved heat transfer model which suit for dual fuel combustion are amongst area of future research...|$|R

The tests were conducted in the Meson Detector Building in a test cell similar in construction to a cell of a Muon PDT. In order to establish the viability of the test set-up, they first repeated the demonstration that P- 10 gas (90 % Argon, 10 % CH 4) is in fact flammable, contrary to the classification by the US DOT. US DOT regulation 173. 115 defines flammable gas as: (1) is ignitable (at 14. 7 psi) when in a mixture of 13 % or less with air; or (2) has a <b>flammability</b> <b>range</b> (at 14. 7 psi) with air of at least 12 % regardless of the lower explosive limit (LEL). P- 10 has a LEL of about 40 % and a <b>flammability</b> <b>range</b> of about 10 %, so P- 10 is not flammable according to the US DOT definition. The point here is that the DOT classifications are to serve the DOT's function to ensure transportation safety, and are not necessarily appropriate for other situations. The first configuration of their test cell, however, apparently failed to ignite P- 10. With the guidance of Bill Nuttall of CERN, they modified their test cell to make it more like the standard flammability testing setups, with a large viewing window and a spark gap {{in the middle of the}} cell. In this second configuration P- 10 was easily and reliably ignitable. After becoming more familiar with the visible indicators of combustion of P- 10 (water vapor cloud formation, pressure changes and gas venting) they retested with the initial configuration, and found that the mixture actually had been burning, and that they had just missed all the indications. The data from CERN showed that P- 10 burns rather slowly, with about a one second rise time for the pressure to reach the maximum of four atmospheres overpressure.

Today hydrogen can be compressed and stored at 200 or 350 bar (it is foreseen that in a near future storage pressure will reach 700 bar, according to new expected regulations and using tanks in composite materials) or cryogenically liquefied. An alternative solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small masses and volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. Moreover, ammonia contains almost 18 % hydrogen by mass and, by volume, liquid ammonia contains 1. 7 times as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen.

The experimental results confirm that it is necessary to add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to increase combustion velocity, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed. Brake power is less than with gasoline, due to mixture poor volumetric heating value and to ammonia low flame speed that penalizes engine brake thermal efficiency.

Knocking combustion causes major engine damage, and also reduces the efficiency. The method uses the measurement and analysis of cylinder pressure signal for various loads. The pressure signal is to be converted into frequency domain that shows the accurate knocking combustion of fuel mixtures. The variation of pressure signal is gradually increased and smoothly reduced to minimum during normal combustion. The rapid rise of pressure signal has occurred during knocking combustion. The experimental setup was mainly available for evaluating the feasibility of normal combustion by comparing with the signals from both fuel mixtures in compression ignition engine. This method provides better results in predicting the knocking feature of biodiesel-hydrogen fuel and the usage of DEE provides complete combustion of fuels with higher performance, and lower emission...|$|E
40|$|Simulated {{results from}} a {{detailed}} elementary reaction mechanism for methane-containing species in flames consisting of nitrogen (NOx), C 1 or C 2 fuels are presented, and compared with reduced mechanism; this mechanism have been constructed with {{the analysis of the}} rate sensitivity matrix f (PCAF method), and the computational singular perturbation (CSP). The analysis was performed on solutions of unstrained adiabatic premixed flames with detailed chemical kinetics described by GRI 3. 0 for methane including NOx formation. A 9 -step reduced mechanism for methane has been constructed which reproduces accurately laminar burning velocities, flame temperatures and mass fraction distributions of major species for the whole <b>flammability</b> <b>range.</b> Many steady-state species are also predicted satisfactorily. This mechanism is especially for lean flames. This mechanism is accurate {{for a wide range of}} the equivalence ratio (1, 0. 9, 0. 8, and 0. 7) and for pressures as high as 40 atm to 60 atm. For both fuels, the CSP algorithm automatically pointed to the same steady-state species as those identified by laborious analysis or intuition in the literature and the global reactions were similar to well established previous methane-reduced mechanisms. This implies that the method is very well suited for the study of complex mechanisms for heavy hydrocarbon combustion...|$|E
40|$|Methanol is an {{important}} renewable energy source that absorbs water easily. The water can be present inadvertently or {{as a result of}} the manufacturing process. Although adding water into methanol will further improve the anti-knock rating for spark ignition engines, the burning velocity, flame stability and the <b>flammability</b> <b>range</b> will be reduced. The laminar burning velocity of methanol containing up to 40 % water in volume (W 0, W 20 and W 40) has been measured for a wide range of temperature (350 - 450 K), pressures (1 - 4 bar) and equivalence ratio (0. 7 - 1. 4) using a constant volume vessel and a schlieren imaging system. The experimental data using the pressure rise data (but excluding cellularity) have been fitted to a correlation with twelve coefficients. The laminar burning velocities for W 0, W 20 and W 40 are 54 cm/s, 31 cm/s and 24 cm/s respectively for stoichiometric mixture at 2 bar and 400 K. Results showed a decrease in burning velocity with pressure and an increase with temperature. Water as a diluent led to reduction of the burning velocity. The correlated burning velocity data for methanol are in good agreement with published data. The cellularity occurred earlier as the initial mixture became rich, while a higher water fraction delayed the onset of cellularity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{low-pressure}} hydrogen direct-injection {{solution is}} presented that entails low storage residual pressure (~ 12 bar). The injection is realised in two steps. First, hydrogen is simply metered by an electro-injector (a conventional one for Compressed Natural Gas - CNG application) that feeds a small intermediate chamber. Next, hydrogen enters the cylinder {{by means of}} a mechanically-actuated valve which allows higher flow than any electro-injector. Injection must end early enough to allow good charge homogeneity and, in any case, before in-cylinder pressure rise constraints hydrogen admission. Backfire is avoided by starting injection at intake valve closing. A prototype has been realised modifying a single-cylinder 650 cc production engine with three intake valves. The central one has been modified and properly timed to in-cylinder inject hydrogen from the intermediate chamber. Hydrogen injection through different-shape poppet valves in a quiescent, constant volume has been simulated in order to investigate the effects of valve and seat-valve geometries in controlling fuel-air mixing in the cylinder. Additional predictions for the actual engine configuration indicate that an acceptable fuel distribution can be obtained in the combustion chamber at the spark timing, with equivalence ratios in the ignition region that are inside the <b>flammability</b> <b>range</b> of the mixture for all the operating conditions (loads and speeds) that have been considered...|$|E
40|$|The main {{challenge}} for the wide spread use of hydrogen in fuel cell systems is the safety concerns due to its ease of leaking, low-energy ignition, large <b>flammability</b> <b>range,</b> high buoyancy and diffusion rate in air. To alleviate concern of explosion during experiments, scientists are using helium as a stimulant for hydrogen safety studies. However, the equivalent behavior between the two gases only relies on numerical or experimental results, and the similarity is not connected by a theoretical correlation. This thesis assesses similarity relations using helium for hydrogen studies and develops a theoretical helium plume model. Meanwhile, {{a case study of}} leakage in fuel cell vehicles is simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of three different correlations, i. e., equal volumetric flow rate, equal buoyancy and equal concentration between helium and hydrogen was compared by CFD simulations validated by helium experiment in a 1 / 4 sub-scale residential garage model. The accuracy of these different methods at different leakage rate, stage of release, ventilation method and location was discussed. An updated theoretical helium plume model was validated by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) experiment and CFD. It is found that the new model could be used in estimating the plume size and velocity. In the case study of hydrogen leakage inside a FCV (Fuel Cell Vehicle), ventilation and sunroof show critical effect to reduce the level of hydrogen concentration accumulation...|$|E
