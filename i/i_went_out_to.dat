[...] He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence. [...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire." [...] When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only, [...] "Doucement, chėrie" [...] ("Gently, my love"). [...] Charlotte both accepted the correction and began calling her husband [...] "Doucement".|$|E
500|$|Former nemesis Johnny Behan {{continued}} to spread rumors about the Earps {{for the next}} 20 years. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in {{a story in the}} Washington Post, reprinted by the San Francisco Call, describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone. After referring to the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight, the article quoted Behan. [...] "The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly rife in that region. Between them and Earps rose a bitter feud over the division of the proceeds of the looting. The Earp boys believed they had failed to get a fair divide of the booty and swore vengeance. They caught their former allies in Tombstone unarmed and shot three of them dead while their hands were uplifted." [...] Behan went on to say, [...] "They were hauled up before a Justice of the Peace... Warrants were issued for their arrest, and, summoning a posse, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bring the Earps in. They were chased entirely out of the country and Tombstone knew them no more." [...] Up until he died in 1912, Johnny Behan lambasted the Earps as the bad men who had attacked the cowboys.|$|E
500|$|With news of {{the death}} of his daughter's friend, Wera Knoop (1900–1919), Rilke set to work on Sonnets to Orpheus. The Sonnets {{frequently}} refer to Wera, both directly where he addresses her by name and indirectly in allusions to a [...] "dancer" [...] or the mythical Eurydice. [...] Rilke wrote to the young girl's mother stating that Wera's ghost was [...] "commanding and impelling" [...] him to write. In a rush of inspiration, Rilke worked on the Sonnets and renewed his focus towards completing the remainder of Duino Elegies. [...] In one week, Rilke completed the unfinished elegies, and from 2 February to 23 February 1922 he completed all the 55 sonnets of the two parts of Sonnets to Orpheus. Rilke considered both collections to be [...] "of the same birth". In a letter to Klossowska on 9 February 1922, Rilke wrote: [...] "what weighed me down and caused my anguish most is done... I am still trembling from it.... And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> caress old Muzot, just now, in the moonlight." [...] Two days later, completing the last of his work on the Elegies in the evening, he wrote to Lou Andreas-Salomé that he had finished [...] "everything in a few days; it was a boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit, and whatever inside me is like thread and webbing, framework, it all cracked and bent. No thought of food." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music videos}} {{presented}} by Skinny Puppy are often graphic and disturbing in nature, featuring heavy uses of blood, gore, and violence. It {{is because of}} this nature {{that the majority of}} the group's videos have received little commercial airplay, or have been banned outright. The music video for [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] was banned by the Canadian Censorship Bureau because of scenes depicting [...] "an excrement-covered woman being beaten by soldiers". The woman in question was in fact a mud soaked Nivek Ogre. The letterbox effect seen in the [...] "Dig It" [...] video was accused by the Bureau and as well as MuchMusic to be portraying pornography; the letterbox actually portrayed stock market footage. Also banned was the video for [...] "Testure", an action resulting from a poll held by CityTV, and the video for the song [...] "Worlock" [...] was banned from MTV. Ogre, a self-described horror fan, defended the [...] "Worlock" [...] video by saying [...] "I knew there was no way they'd play [...] "Worlock' there [...] But <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make that video so no one would play it!"; Ogre has affirmed that the video was meant to draw attention to censorship in horror films. Some of Skinny Puppy's music videos have received airplay, such as those for the promotional singles [...] "Killing Game" [...] and [...] "Pro-test"; [...] "Dig It" [...] was also occasionally played on MTV. A 30-second television promo was produced for the band by Capital Records in 1987, featuring a mix of scenes from the [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] and [...] "Dig It" [...] videos.|$|E
