Many <b>formal</b> <b>credit</b> market entities had disappeared during the Great Depression, and peasants who held smaller lots of land generally had no capital to utilise a <b>formal</b> <b>credit</b> market to purchase any good or service beyond their immediate means. They typically {{had to resort to}} informal local lenders; for example, when they needed consumer credit for large, occasional expenses such as weddings, religious ceremonies, births, or deaths. More frequently, they needed money to help purchase basic necessities during lean months between harvests, and so were [...] "forced to sell their products at deflated prices during post-harvest glut, in order to pay loans taken during the pre-harvest 'starvation' season". Moreover, though land had traditionally been relatively available, the means of production (such as seed or cattle for ploughing) had always been scarce, and smallholders' lands were sometimes sold in times of distress to purchase these. At other times, peasants were simply compelled by force to take on debt.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the influence}} of formal micro-credit on the socio-economic welfare of smallholder farmers in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. A total of 180 farm households {{were randomly selected from}} 12 autonomous communities. Structured questionnaire and interview schedules were the major instruments used for data collection. Data collected was analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics such as the mean, tables, percentages, etc and inferential statistics such as logit test and regression analysis were used for the specific objectives. A logit econometric model was used to quantify and analyse the data obtained on factors that influence farmers’ access to <b>formal</b> micro <b>credit.</b> The result of the analyses showed that variables like annual income, marital status and farmers’ main occupation influenced their access to <b>formal</b> micro <b>credit</b> and were significant at 5 % level of significant. It was equally observed that the amount of <b>formal</b> micro <b>credit</b> obtained was positively and significantly correlated with annual farm income. It also observed that 41 % of the borrowers had tangible assets that valued higher than N 150, 000. 00 when compared to non-borrowers who were only 5 %. The major constraints identified were mandatory minimum savings; late release of funds; inability to provide CBN guarantee certificate and lack of security/collateral.

40|$|The {{crucial role}} played by small and {{medium-sized}} industries (SMIs) in developing countries is very well acknowledged. In Malaysia, for example, the SMIs are perceived as {{the backbone of the}} nation's industrialisation process. However, the promotion and development of these SMIs are often hampered by their lack of access to <b>formal</b> institutional <b>credits.</b> The lack of access to <b>formal</b> <b>credits</b> is often ascribed to the higher level of perceived risks, moral hazards and transactions costs. At present, banks and SMIs in developing countries do not have the appropriate technology to adequately assess these risks. The present study seeks to suggest that project appraisal practice can and should be adopted by the SMIs in order to assess their project's risks. Banks are recommended to use similar techniques to objectively evaluate their lending risks. Built upon the theoretical framework of finance and development, the study empirically evaluates the relationship between the adoption of project appraisal practice by the SMIs and their access to formal sector finance. In addition, the study also attempts to identify the factors that can influence the company's decision whether or not to adopt formal project appraisal practice. A very significant and positive relationship was found between the adoption of project appraisal practice and the SMIs' access to formal sector finance. The following factors were found to be significant in determining whether or not a firm adopts project appraisal practice: (1) access to banks finance, (2) entrepreneur's level of education, (3) training on project appraisal, (4) market classification, and, (5) level of business experience. The study therefore concludes that the adoption of project appraisal practice by SMIs should be encouraged through formal training. Finally, the study suggests that the present system of providing finance to SMIs should be reformed and a more innovative and efficient system is recommended...|$|R

30|$|Several {{studies on}} Switzerland {{demonstrate}} {{that there is}} a clear distinction between the linguistic groups in terms of work attitudes, voting behaviour, demand for social insurance, taxation or financial practices (Eugster et al. 2017; Eugster et al. 2011; Eugster and Parchet, 2013; Guin, 2017). Guin (2017) shows, for example, that considerable differences exist in behaviour associated with savings and indebtedness. Households in French-speaking regions save less than those in the German-speaking regions, {{and are more likely to}} take out <b>formal</b> <b>credits</b> and informal ones (among the family network, for example) in the case of financial difficulties and overdue payments. This is confirmed by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO); households in the French-speaking regions are ahead of the Italian- and German-speaking Swiss in terms of indebtedness. 1 Moreover, debts owed to the family or to friends are more common among the French-speaking Swiss than German speakers. 2 The same tendency can be found among people aged 18 – 30 [*]years. The existing literature suggests that French-speaking students save less (Guin, 2017). German-speaking people who leave the parental home have larger incomes, have fewer financial difficulties, save more and have fewer overdue payments than those in the other regions of the country (Wernli and Henchoz, 2015).|$|R
40|$|In China, pawnbrokers {{not only}} provide {{financial}} intermediation services to individuals and households who need to finance their short-term gap between consumption and income like those in many other countries, but {{also serve as a}} supplementary financing channel for private entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who face difficulty in obtaining <b>formal</b> <b>credits.</b> This paper uses the first-hand survey data in 2008 - 2009 in Zhejiang Province, one of the pioneering regions for developing pawn-broking business, to study the special characteristics of the pawn-broking industry and explain why it has become a viable and useful financing instrument in transitional China. Through examining why there was a serious setback and widespread loss in the industry during the global financial crisis in 2008 - 09, we argue that the crisis increased the default rate of export-oriented SMEs, which reduced their demand for pawn-broking loans. The strict regulations in the pawn-broking industry and the low efficiency of litigation in China also increased the operation costs of handling defaults by the pawnshops, leading to a temporary setback in an otherwise rapidly growing pawnbroking business during the crisis. However, the pawn-broking industry will continue {{to play an important role}} in financing SMEs in China in the foreseeable future...|$|R
