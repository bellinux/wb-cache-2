5|$|With paying gigs {{harder to}} find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for his family, having married in 1959.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E
25|$|As {{occurred}} elsewhere, {{many businesses}} laid off workers or closed altogether and many banks failed. To help keep <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> during hard times, many residents of Ybor City plowed under their yards or vacant lots to plant vegetables and bought cows, goats, and chickens to provide milk, eggs, and meat for the family, with any surplus sold around town. Interestingly, {{the descendants of}} those chickens still roam the area.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people do}} not cover <b>the</b> other <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> during kiddush.|$|R
50|$|If {{covering}} the challah {{is because of}} kadima, only food items that precede wine in the sequence of blessings should be covered {{at the time of}} kiddush or remain off <b>the</b> <b>table</b> until after kiddush. This would include only bread (which has a blessing of hamotzi) and cake (which has a blessing of mezonos); if covering is because of the dew, only challah needs to be covered; if because of honor, even gefilte fish, cole slaw and other <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> should be covered (or brought to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> only when their respective course begins).|$|R
50|$|In formal settings, a meal is {{commenced}} {{when the}} eldest or most senior diner at <b>the</b> <b>table</b> partakes {{of any of}} <b>the</b> <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Before partaking, intention to enjoy their meal should be expressed. Similarly, satisfaction or enjoyment of that meal should be expressed at its completion. On occasion, there are some dishes which require additional cooking or serving at <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> In this case, the youngest or lowest-ranked adult diner should perform this task. When serving, diners are served food and drink in descending order starting with the eldest or highest-ranked diner to the youngest or lowest-ranked.|$|R
25|$|Houses, {{cars and}} {{businesses}} were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning {{that someone would}} break the door to get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving dirty {{dishes in the sink}} and <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> while rubbing some into his face.|$|E
25|$|Season 3 creates many dynamic {{changes with}} regards to {{relationships}} and power within the characters' society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced {{to move into a}} trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to put <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for her daughters. Marissa's life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University. Sandy's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more low-income housing in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the New Parlour shows typical {{features}} of a modest 17th-century dining room. Servants placed <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side <b>table,</b> and served it to the family. The court cupboard housed pewter and plate and could be locked as could the small corner spice cupboard, the key kept by the mistress, as spices were valuable commodities.|$|R
50|$|Luchi (circular, deep-fried unleavened bread) or Porothha (usually triangular, multi-layered, pan fried, unleavened bread) {{are also}} used as <b>the</b> primary <b>food</b> item <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> It is {{considered}} that wheat-based food {{came in from the}} north and is relatively new in advent. Both Luchi and Parothha could have stuffed versions as well, and the stuffing could vary from dal, peas, etc.|$|R
60|$|Mary Louise {{arranged}} some <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>table</b> for Sarah Judd {{and after}} the girl had eaten, Mrs. Conant {{took her to the}} maid's room, which was a very pleasant and well furnished apartment quite in keeping with all the comfortable appointments at Hillcrest Lodge, although it was built behind the kitchen and formed a little wing of its own.|$|R
500|$|Murphy {{was born}} into a large {{sharecropper}} family in Hunt County, Texas. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle was a necessity for putting <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Arena's autobiography, Now I Can Dance, {{published}} by HarperCollins, {{was released on}} 14 October 2013 in paperback and E-book format. It is billed by HarperCollins as [...] "Honest and intimate, funny and frank, Now I Can Dance is the long-awaited memoir from the very special, much-loved singer, songwriter and pop diva, Tina Arena." [...] She told Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia that [...] "I don't need to put a book out to put <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> It started to dawn on me {{in the last year}} that I have had an unbelievable life and I want people to know it's been hilarious, there's been a lot of laughter in my journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Dumbledore and {{his friend}} Elphias left Hogwarts, they planned to take their [...] "then-traditional" [...] tour of the world. On the eve of their trip, the eighteen-year-old Dumbledore {{suffered}} {{the death of his}} mother Kendra, who was accidentally killed by Ariana during one of her uncontrolled outbursts of magic. Because Dumbledore's parents were absent (his father in Azkaban and his mother dead), Albus became the head of the family and it became his duty to put <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> as they were not left with much gold. He was forced to remain in his house with his sister Ariana while Aberforth completed his education. Aberforth knew of his brother's resentment and offered to care for Ariana himself, saying that she preferred him, but Albus refused by stating that it was his duty as eldest to care for the family.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Henshaw {{had just}} {{finished}} dinner. The neatly cleaned bone of a chop was on a plate by her side; a small dish which had contained a rice- pudding was empty; and <b>the</b> only <b>food</b> left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was a small rind of cheese {{and a piece of}} stale bread. Mr. Henshaw's face fell, but he drew his chair up to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and waited.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known Moldovan dish is a {{well-known}} Romanian dish, mămăligă (a cornmeal mush or porridge). This is a staple polenta-like <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moldovan <b>table,</b> served as an accompaniment to stews and meat dishes or garnished with cottage cheese, sour cream, or pork rind. Regional delicacies include brânză (a brined cheese) and ghiveci (a lamb or goat stew). Local wines accompany most meals.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, an {{increasing}} number of studies concerning seeds and fruits recorded in archaeological sites of the Emilia Romagna region were carried out thanks to the co-operation between our laboratory and the Soprintendenza Archeologica. The archaeological sites involved dated from the Neolithic to <b>the</b> Modern Age. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> whole, the seeds and fruits studied were several hundred thousands and their floristic list includes hundreds of species/carpological types. Many of them belong to plants producing ‘fruits’ (in the common – not strictly botanical - sense of the word). In the Roman times, these records increased suggesting that fruit became an important and habitual <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> of Emilia Romagna, during that period. This paper presents a brief review of the ‘fruit’ records found in 11 archaeological sites of the region dated in the Roman period, based on published and unpublished data.

2500|$|Clarence Thomas {{was born}} in 1948 in Pin Point, Georgia, a small, {{predominantly}} black community near Savannah founded by freedmen after the American Civil War. [...] He was the second of three children born to M.C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams, a domestic worker. They were descendants of American slaves, and the family spoke Gullah as a first language. Thomas's earliest-known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy who were born {{around the end of}} the 18th century and owned by wealthy Liberty County, Georgia, planter Josiah Wilson. M.C. left his family when Thomas was two years old. Thomas's mother worked hard but was sometimes paid only pennies per day. She had difficulty putting <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and was forced to rely on charity. After a house fire left them homeless, Thomas and his younger brother Myers were taken to live with his maternal grandparents in Savannah, Georgia. Thomas was seven when the family moved in with his maternal grandfather, Myers Anderson, and Anderson's wife, Christine (née Hargrove), in Savannah.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{perceptions}} on who Mohamed Bouazizi was. After his self-immolation, Bouazizi’s image flooded social media {{which lead to}} worldwide discourse. This complicated how Bouazizi was seen, [...] "Mohamed Bouazizi is not our hero. He's your hero," [...] said local Tunisian Arabic Nader Ncibi. There are accusations that social media diluted what Bouazizi stood for. Naafil Harshani, an activist that grew up with Bouazizi, said, [...] "what was important to Mohamed was putting <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and football. He {{had nothing to do}} with politics and wanted nothing to do with politics." [...] Mohamed Bouazizi did not plan to start a revolution, but it is undeniable that it preceded his anger towards not being able to sell his fruit. [...] "There are many stories on who Mohamed was and who Mohamed wasn't," [...] said Zahra Shwabli, a Hay Al Noor primary school teacher, [...] "It is important for us on this day to remember what Mohamed Bouazizi stood for: the dignity of all Tunisians. And that is something that not even time can take away from us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts <b>food</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
25|$|June is {{dedicated}} to her family; her interests outside the home are social events like weddings or school events like meetings and plays. She has ladylike pastimes: needlepoint, cake decorating, and arranging tea roses. She reads glossy but high-toned, tasteful women's magazines. In one episode, she entertains the ladies in her social club only to see the event ruined by Beaver's monkey who despoils <b>the</b> <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dining <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|II. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{vertical}} axis — with {{the contrast of}} light and shadow, the picture symbolizes the co-existence of mortality and the earthly pleasures; above the Jesus figure, a lamb is butchered, beneath the Jesus figure there are musicians, and before them is an hourglass, {{a reference to the}} futility of human vanity. As a function of the painting, the protocol of religious symbolism supersedes the social protocol for a wedding banquet; thus, the disparity of status, between the celebrants and the guests: Jesus, Mary, and some of his Apostles sit at the centre span of <b>the</b> banquet <b>table,</b> whilst <b>the</b> bride and bridegroom sit at the right wing of <b>the</b> banquet <b>table.</b> Moreover, despite <b>the</b> continuing preparation of roasted-meat, the main course of a meal, the guests appear to be eating the dessert course of the meal, given that <b>the</b> <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> include fruits and quince cheese, a comestible symbol of marriage; such a culinary contradiction indicates that the animals are symbolic and not for eating.|$|R

5000|$|Rabbi Yisroel {{was once}} {{stranded}} in Kovno for Shabbat. Everyone wanted to host him, but {{he chose to}} spend the Shabbat {{at the home of}} a baker who had no children to feed, so he would not take away anyone's portion of food. The baker was an observant Jew but hardly a man of intelligence.As he ushered his esteemed guest into his house, he shouted at his wife, [...] "Why are the challahs not covered? How many times must I remind you to cover the challahs?" [...] The poor woman, recognizing her distinguished guest, hurried to cover the challahs with tears in her eyes.When the baker asked Rabbi Yisroel to do the honors by reciting the Kiddush, the Rabbi first asked him, [...] "Can you tell me why we cover the challahs?""Of course," [...] replied the baker. [...] "Every child knows the answer. When there are many different <b>foods</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> first blessing is always made over the bread, after which no other blessing need be made. On Friday night, however, the first blessing has to be made over the wine. In order not to shame the challah, who expects the blessing to be made over her, we must cover her over until after the sanctification of the wine."Rabbi Yisroel looked at the baker incredulously. [...] "Why do your ears not hear what your mouth is saying?" [...] he asked. [...] "Do you think that our Jewish tradition does not understand that a piece of dough has no feelings and would never become embarrassed? Understand that our laws are trying to sensitize us to the feelings of human beings, our friends, our neighbors, and especially our wives!" ...|$|R
