40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 6 Large {{utility steam}} {{turbines}} have experienced very high vibration levels on their generator exciter bearings. Units where the <b>exciter</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is supported by}} a single bearing are particularly susceptible. This synchronous vibration, measured as high as 14 mils (pk/pk), is typically unresponsive to balancing attempts. Vibration levels of this magnitude can lead to bearing or bearing support damage and higher scrutiny by insurers. Exciter and generator rotors are direct coupled, but differ significantly in mass. As the generator is loaded, it grows vertically, drawing the smaller <b>exciter</b> <b>rotor</b> with it. If adequate loading of the exciter journal bearing has not been established during generator to exciter alignment, the bearing becomes unloaded, affecting its stiffness and damping properties. These changes affect the exciter's vibration response and balance characteristics. Bearing modifications can enhance bearing stiffness and damping properties, reduce the effect of the exciter rotor's radial growth, and improve balancing characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyse {{different}} design possibilities for a rotating permanent magnet exciter for a hydroelectric generator. This is done through development of design models for optimizing suitable solutions. By use of Matlab/Simulink, COMSOL Multiphysics and ACE, the dynamics {{and the performance of}} the design is investigated. The aim is to have a robust system with low torque ripple absorbed by the exciter. It is shown that the six phase rectification solution has lower torque ripple for normal delay angles of the thyristor bridge compared to the three phase solution. For further development to try to reduce the torque ripple even more, one should optimize (reduce) the self and mutual inductances of the <b>exciter</b> <b>rotor</b> windings. A reduction of the parasitic magnetic energy storage in the system will reduce the torque ripple drastically...|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{components of a}} synchronous motor are the stator and the rotor. The stator of synchronous motor and stator of induction motor are similar in construction. With the wound-rotor synchronous doubly fed electric machine as the exception, the stator frame contains wrapper plate. Circumferential ribs and keybars {{are attached to the}} wrapper plate. To carry the weight of the machine, frame mounts and footings are required. When the field winding is excited by DC excitation, brushes and slip rings are required to connect to the excitation supply. The field winding can also be excited by a brushless <b>exciter.</b> Cylindrical, round <b>rotors,</b> (also known as non salient pole rotor) are used for up to six poles. In some machines or when a large number of poles are needed, a salient pole rotor is used.The construction of synchronous motor {{is similar to that of}} a synchronous alternator.|$|R
40|$|A {{flywheel}} {{energy storage}} system based on a doubly-fed induction generator-motor basically consists of a wound-rotor induction machine and a cycloconverter or a voltage-source PWM rectifier-inverter which is used as an AC <b>exciter.</b> Adjusting the <b>rotor</b> speed makes the generator-motor either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the generator-motor has the capability of achieving not only reactive power control, but also active power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction generator-motor, which {{is characterized by the}} combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction generator-motor to perform active power control independent of reactive power control even in transient states. The validity of the theory developed in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation. In addition, this paper discusses a transient behavior of a magnetizing current in the induction machine</p...|$|R
