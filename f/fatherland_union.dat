50|$|Wilhelm {{was only}} {{allowed to return}} to Germany from his {{enforced}} exile in 1923. Before then visits to him were difficult. Fortunately for the Hohenzollern family they still possessed considerable private holdings in Germany due to a provisional agreement worked out between the Hohenzollern family and the Prussian state in November 1920. Castle Oels, a castle with 10,000 hectares of workable land in Silesia, now modern day Poland, provided substantial income for Cecilie's family. In the absence of her husband, Cecilie became the leading figure in the once ruling House of Hohenzollern. The former Crown Princess was under no illusions that the empire would be restored, unlike her father-in-law exiled in Doorn in the Netherlands. His return was completely impossible. With the election of Gustav Stresemann as Chancellor of the Weimar Republic in August 1923, negotiations for the former Crown Prince commenced. On the evening of 13 November 1923, Cecilie met her husband at Castle Oels. The years of separation and the behavior of Wilhelm had made the marriage now merely one in name only, but Cecilie was determined to keep things together even at a distance. More and more she lived in Cecilienhof at Potsdam, while her husband lived in Silesia. The couple would come together when necessary for the sake of family unity for occasions such as family weddings, confirmation of children, christenings and funerals. In 1927, a final financial agreement was reached between the Hohenzollerns and the Prussian state. Cecilie remained active within several charity organizations such as the Queen Luise Fund, Chair of the <b>Fatherland's</b> Women <b>Union</b> and the Ladies of the Order of St. John, while keeping clear of any political involvement. With the coming to power of the National Socialist Party of Adolf Hitler in 1933, all such charitable organizations were dissolved.|$|R

2500|$|Danish Navy, Army and Air Force units carry a unit colour (...) {{and for the}} Life Guards a {{battalion}} colour (...) , which measures 105 × 140cm, former horse units a slightly smaller guidon. The flag is {{a variation of the}} Dannebrog, with a curvilinear white Dannebrog cross, called the Mantova cross, set with its centre about one-half the width of the hoist from the hoist edge. The royal cypher is embroidered in gold over the centre of the cross, the unit badge in gold in the upper hoist, and the unit number, name or both in gold in the lower hoist. Some regiments have additional marks in the upper fly. The Jyske Dragonregiment, for instance, has Prince Henrik's cipher in the upper fly. The finial is an ornate gold openwork spearhead with the royal cypher in the centre. Attached below the spearhead can be one or more campaign streamers (...) [...] The colour is decorated with a gold cord with two tassels and bordered with a thin strip of gold cord. The sleeve holding the colour to the pike is attached with ornamental nails, the first three of which represent the sovereign, the <b>Fatherland,</b> and the <b>Union.</b>|$|R

Social democrats were in government in 1992-1994 Mart Laar's first government, in 1994-1995 Andres Tarand's government (often called to Christmas Peace government (jõulurahu valitsus)) and in 1999-2002 Mart Laar's second government (often called Triple Alliance (kolmikliit)) and from 2007 to 2009, when the Social Democrat ministers were expelled from the government.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, A {{large group}} of North Korean {{citizens}} and officials waved the flag when saying goodbye to Ro Su-hui, vice-chairman of the Reunification of the <b>Fatherland</b> <b>Union</b> (Pomminryon). This was {{on the occasion of}} his return to South Korea from North Korea by crossing the DMZ line. Media reports referred to the flag as the “Korea is one” flag. He was immediately arrested upon his return to South Korea and later jailed.|$|E
50|$|Here he {{came into}} close contact with the {{democratic}} opposition organised by Friedrich Schüler, Johann Georg August Wirth, Joseph Savoye and Ferdinand Geib. In {{a report from the}} state police to the Bavarian king he was described - incorrectly - as their boyhood friend and fellow student. The German Press and <b>Fatherland</b> <b>Union</b> (Deutscher Preß- und Vaterlandsverein) of democrats was founded in 1832, in which the wealthy Paul Camille Denis was a major financial contributor. In his personal files for that year his wealth was stated at 300,000 Gulden. When in August 1832 the secretary of the Preß- und Vaterlandsverein, Georg Eifler, was arrested, Paul Camille Denis put up 10,000 Gulden as bail.|$|E
50|$|Priester was interned by the American {{occupation}} {{forces from}} 1946 to 1948. When released {{he joined the}} National Democratic Party, a rightist party led by Heinrich Leuchtgens and mainly active in Wiesbaden (and distinct from the later National Democratic Party of Germany). Act as the group's propagandist, he helped {{to ensure that the}} group secured local representation. However Priester's neo-Nazi tendencies put him at odds with the more conservative leadership and in December 1949 his wing broke away. This group, largely based in Hesse, linked up with the <b>Fatherland</b> <b>Union</b> of Karl Freitenhansl to form a new party, the Nationaldemokratische Reichs-Partei (NDRP). The new group co-operated with the Socialist Reich Party for a time but merger discussions floundered as Priester became isolated from his colleagues due to his heavy-handed style of leadership. Eventually Priester was expelled from the NDRP in December 1950, establishing his own Deutsch-Soziale Bewegung in March of the following year.|$|E
50|$|During the Restauration and Vormärz periods, the Palatinate {{became a}} stronghold of the liberal-democratic {{movement}} which reached its zenith in 1832 with the “Hambacher Fest”. Philipp Siebenpfeiffer and Johann Wirth, both journalists, had transformed Zweibrücken and Homburg into hotspots of {{fighting for the}} new rights of freedom through their establishment of the “Deutscher Preß- und Vaterlandsverein” (German Press and <b>Fatherland</b> <b>Union)</b> and publication of the “Boten aus dem Westen” (Messages from the West) and “Deutsche Tribüne” (German Tribune). In April 1832 they issued a general invitation to a large-scale but peaceable festival at Hambach Castle - {{in the words of}} Wirth a “national festival for the German people, a festival to shake off all violence within and without”. Their close circle included numerous advocates and judges from the Zweibrücken court of appeal, such as Schüler, Geib, Savoye, Cullmann and Hoffmann. On 27 May 1832, twenty to thirty thousand people assembled at Hambach Castle at what was the largest ever mass event in Germany before 1848.The Bavarian government’s reaction was immediate and drastic. Siebenpfeiffer and Wirth were arrested and, among others, put on trial - by jury however - before the court of appeal on a charge of high treason. To prevent further unrest the “assize trial” was transferred from Zweibrücken to Landau.The trial ended with an acquittal from the charge of high treason - however Siebenpfeiffer and Wirth were subsequently put on trial before a police court for affronting authorities.|$|E
