Frequencies of 67 common weed species in spring barley, spring rape, winter rye, winter wheat and <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> were compared. The comparison {{showed that the}} occurrence of common weed species has generally decreased during the last 20 years. The frequency of some species such as Anagallis arvensis, Arenaria serpyllifolia, Atriplex patula, Cerastium caespitosum [C. fontanum], Galium aparine, Plantago major and Silene noctiflora has decreased markedly, possibly because of intensive chemical weed control. The dominating weed species in the 1987 - 89 survey were largely {{the same as in}} the 1967 - 70 survey, namely Capsella bursa-pastoris, Chenopodium album, Elymus repens, Myosotis arvensis, Poa annua, Polygonum aviculare, P. convolvulus [Fallopia convolvulus], P. persicaria, Stellaria media, Taraxacum, Veronica arvensis, V. persica and Viola arvensis.

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the effects of level of nitrogen supply on the root dynamics, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) return to soil from root turnover, decomposition, and stability of improved grasslands. Field studies involved a two-year field experiment, where plant species composition, above ground biomass production, root production, litter decomposition and short term soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, {{as a response to}} varying levels of inorganic fertiliser nitrogen supply were studied. The results showed that root dynamics are strongly affected by N fertilisation, with an increase in root production and death with increasing N supply. Reduced water availability lead to a greater root disappearance rate and the production of roots with a shorter lifespan. Root decomposition was strongly influenced by the age of the <b>grass</b> <b>ley,</b> which also exerted a strong influence on the structure of the soil microbial communities (SMC). Rate of litter decomposition and SMC structure were also influenced by the level of N supply. Level of mineral N supply and age of the <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> also influenced the formation and stability of water stable aggregates, the microbial community structure and microbial community function within the aggregates. Mineral N applications are likely to influence SOM and soil nutrient dynamics. The finding that climatic conditions, and in particular water availability, had the strongest impact on both above and below ground productivity, and strongly influenced the amount of C, N and root/shoot biomass returned to soils, is of great importance in helping to make more accurate predictions of the response of plant communities to projected changes in the global climate.

40|$|This report {{contains}} a meta-analysis of results from field trials with nitrogen application to leys which {{were carried out}} during 1997 - 2015. The analysis deals with the response to nitrogen fertilisation with respect to dry matter and crude protein content in the harvested biomass. The analysis shows that the yield level without any nitrogen application, and the response to nitrogen (kg dry matter/kg N applied), is greater in these trials compared to data from older trials. This applies to both pure <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> and mixed grass/clover leys. The crude protein content is positively correlated with nitrogen application in pure <b>grass</b> <b>leys.</b> In mixed grass/clover leys this response depends on clover content, but is generally negative in the last cut...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to investigate the optimal economic life cycle of <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> with winter damage problems in northern Norway and to determine the threshold of winter damage before it is profitable to re-seed. A two-level hierarchic Markov process has been constructed using the MLHMP software. The model takes uncertainty concerning yield potential, damage estimation and weather dependent random fluctuations into account. A Kalman filter technique is used for updating of knowledge on yield potential and damage level. The application of the model is demonstrated using data from two commercial Norwegian farms. Since parameter estimates vary considerably among farms, it is concluded that decision support concerning optimal economic life cycle of <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> should be done at farm level. The results also show the importance of using a flexible dynamic replacement strategy. Use of the model for a specific farm situation is illustrated. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Two field experiments, {{conventional}} <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> {{and organic}} grass-clover ley, were established with barley {{as a nurse}} crop in spring 2000 and given either low or high fertilization with mineral fertilizer (Mineral) or composts. The compost types were municipal biowaste (Biowaste), biowaste + sewage sludge (BioSludge) and cattle manure (Manure). Plant yields and nitrogen (N) uptakes were measured {{for three years and}} efficiency of N utilization was estimated. In single application of compost, the total N was mainly in organic form and less than 10 % was in inorganic form. Along with increasing amount of inorganic N applied in compost, the yield, N uptake and N recovery increased during the application year. The highest compost N recovery in the application year was 12 %, found with Biowaste. In the following years the highest N recovery was found where the lowest total N had been applied. Clover performance was improved in the organic grass-clover ley established with BioSludge fertilization, producing total ley yield comparable with Manure compost. High total N application in composts caused high N surplus and low N use efficiency over three years. Generally, moderate compost fertilization is suitable for ley crops when supplemented with mineral N fertilizer or clover N fixation. ...|$|E
40|$|Metadata onlyThe {{contribution}} of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) ley set-aside to soil conservation and {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) content was investigated. Ten runoff plots (7 – 15 °, 12 – 27 % slope) at the Hilton Experimental Site, Shropshire, UK, were put to a <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> in April 1991. Runoff and erosion rates during 9 years were low, despite the occurrence of potentially erosive rains. Mean runoff was 0. 24 ± 0. 20 % (±S. D.) of precipitation (n = 89 plot-years), compared with a 15 -year mean value of 0. 13 ± 0. 04 % on permanent (control) grassland. Mean erosion rate was 0. 21 ± 0. 14 t ha− 1 year− 1 (n = 69 plot-years). Erosion rate and slope were poorly correlated, suggesting leys are highly effective for soil conservation. Mean SOM content increased consistently and significantly on the set-aside plots from 20. 4 g kg− 1 in 1991 to 31. 1 g kg− 1 in 2001. Contrary to the usually strong relationship between SOM and clay content, the percentage silt exhibited a stronger correlation with SOM than percentage clay content. Furthermore, there were equally strong correlations between SOM and cumulative particle size fractions of both clay and silt contents. In the absence of significant quantities of clay in these sandy soils, silts assist binding of SOM, which has significance for assessing soil carbon sequestration potential...|$|E
40|$|LP {{models of}} Norwegian dairy farms are {{designed}} to evaluate the impact of changes in prices and subsidies on production systems and on profitability at the farm level. At 1999 -prices, producing a fixed milk quota with low to moderate yielding cows (6000 to 6600 kg milk annually) is most profitable. Silage offered ad libitum is profitable. A three cut harvesting system is more profitable than two cuts. Changes in the milk price have no effects on production. If forage crops is the only possible land use, increased area payments have no effects on production. If non-forage crops are also grown, increased area payments for forage crops result in {{a higher proportion of}} the land being used for temporary <b>grass</b> (<b>ley)</b> and in cheaper forage, making higher silage intake per cow profitable. Higher intake of silage achieved through supplementing less con-centrates, results in lower milk yield per cow. By increasing headage payments, milk yield falls, as it is optimal to have more cows to produce the same quota output. Reduced product and concentrate prices combined with higher area and headage payments result in more cows and lower yields. Silage offered in a fixed ration is the most profitable option and the level of concentrates per cow is high. More land is then used for permanent pastures and less for non-forage crops...|$|E

Before the arrival of monocultures of ryegrass, both <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> and permanent pasture always contained A. millefolium {{at a rate of}} about 0.3 kg/ha. At least one of the reasons for its inclusion in grass mixtures was its deep roots, with leaves rich in minerals. Thus its inclusion helped to prevent mineral deficiencies in the ruminants to which it was fed.|$|R

40|$|The FASSET farm {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} production in an experiment where a grass-clover or a <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> was either cut or grazed with dairy cows receiving low or high N sup-plements. The six different ley types were ploughed in and followed by three years with spring cereals with undersown catch crops. The original model was extended with a new grass and clover model, which included the capability to simulate rhizodeposition and root growth. The new model predicted the observed annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) production satisfactorily. The simulated first year residual effects of a cut grass or grass-clover ley varied between 0 and 34, while the residual effect of a grazed grass or grass-clover ley varied between 71 and 150 fertilizer equivalents (kg N ha- 1). Second and third year residual effects of the grazed leys were ca. 40 and 9 fertilizer equiva-lents, respectively, while the residual effects of the cut leys were ca. 5 and 3 fertilizer equiva-lents. The effects of the different treatments on nitrate leaching were simulated quite satisfacto-rily. However, there was a deviation between the simulated and observed absolute level and timing of nitrate concentrations in suction cups. Scenario analysis showed that this partly {{could be explained by}} problems with refractory soil organic matter and gross nitrogen miner-alization in soils with high C:N ratios. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a whole spectrum of gasses, which is undesirable occurs during ensiling process. The {{formation of}} gasses is undesirable, because it is often a sign of undesirable processes in silages, and causes concern about {{the impact on the}} global environment. Formation of CO 2 is the most abundant. Besides CO 2, the formation of toxic N oxides also occurs during ensiling. Since silage additive addition affects the fermentation pattern, the aim {{of the study was to}} monitor the formation of various gasses from silages treated with different silage additives. A <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> (70 % timothy) was harvested on August 24 th 2013, nearby Helsingborg. Bacterial inoculant (E. faecium, L. plantarum, L. buchneri) at the rate of 250000 cfu/g FF, and silage additive Safesil at the rate of 3 L/ton FF were compared with untreated control. Gasses collected in bags were analysed for N 2, H 2, O 2, CO, CH 4 by gas chromatographaphy. CO 2, NO, and NO 2 were absorbed in water and analysed using ion chromatography. Standard analyses to determine silage quality were performed after ensiling period. Silages treated with bacterial inoculant had significantly higher pH, propionic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol contents but lower concentration of lactic acid than other silage treatments. Control and bacterially inoculated silages produced more gas than Safesil treated silages, mainly due to an increased proportion of CO 2. The formation of NOx gases displayed no significant differences among other treatments...|$|E
40|$|A multi-season 15 N tracer {{recovery}} {{experiment was}} conducted on an Oxisol cropped with wheat, maize and sorghum to compare crop N recoveries of different fertilisation strategies and determine the main pathways of N losses that limit N recovery in these agroecosystems. In the wheat and maize seasons, 15 N-labelled fertiliser was applied as conventional urea (CONV) and urea coated with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). In sorghum, the fate of 15 N-labelled urea was monitored in this crop following a legume ley pasture (L 70) or a <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> pasture (G 100). The fertiliser N applied to sorghum in the legume-cereal rotation was reduced (70 kg N ha− 1) compared to the grass-cereal (100 kg N ha− 1) to assess {{the availability of the}} N residual from the legume ley pasture. Average crop N recoveries were 73 % (CONV) and 77 % (DMPP) in wheat and 50 % (CONV) and 51 % (DMPP) in maize, while in sorghum were 71 % (L 70) and 53 % (G 100). Data gathered in this study indicate that the intrinsic physical and chemical conditions of Oxisols can be extremely effective in limiting N losses via deep leaching or denitrification. Elevated crop 15 N recoveries can be therefore obtained in subtropical Oxisols using conventional urea while in these agroecosystems DMPP urea has no significant scope to increase fertiliser N recovery in the crop. Overall, introducing a legume phase to limit the fertiliser N requirements of the following cereal crop proved to be the most effective strategy to reduce N losses and increase fertiliser N recovery...|$|E

In this study emergence trapping was utilized during 1998 from plots ploughed in winter, spring or left undisturbed in fields of wheat stubble or undersown <b>grass</b> <b>leys.</b> In 1999, emergence from winter-ploughed or undisturbed plots in fields of wheat stubble or undersown <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> was compared, with and without frost protection. The catch was dominated by adult and larval Coleoptera, of which 68 and 77 % were Carabidae in 1998 and 1999 respectively. In 1998 the period of peak emergence of Carabidae, Curculionidae and total Coleoptera were earlier from unploughed compared to ploughed treatments. None of the treatments influenced the time of arthropod emergence in 1999. In 1998 only Curculionidae were affected by ploughing, with more being captured from the winter-ploughed plots. In 1999 the emergence of six carabid species was lower from the ploughed plots, whereas Notiophilus biguttatus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) favoured the ploughed plots. Total Carabidae, other coleopteran adults and larvae and aranean groups were also lower in the ploughed plots.

40|$|Management {{decisions}} {{significantly affect}} nitrate-N leaching (N-leaching) from comparable organic fields.

On farms with grazing animals the occurrence of “hot spots” should be avoided. These hot spots develop with uneven concentrations of animal manure combined with limited N-uptake in the ley. Management measures to minimize N-leachingmay conflicts with the farmers aim to produce high quality feed and/or to combat yield limiting perennial weeds.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{reduction}} in quality, together with increasing homogeneity of the farmed landscape and more intensive field management, {{are believed to}} be major drivers of biodiversity loss on farmland. Organic farms demonstrate features that are now rare elsewhere in UK farming systems, such as crop rotations incorporating <b>grass</b> <b>leys,</b> exclusion of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and reliance on animal and green manures. They may also contain greater densities of uncropped habitats such as hedgerows. In this study, we examined whether organic farming affected populations of one group of insects of conservation interest, butterflies, on farmland. The abundance of butterflies on pairs of organically and conventionally managed farms was recorded over 3 years and a number of habitat and crop variables, likely to be related to butterfly abundance, were also measured. Organic farms attracted significantly more butterflies overall than conventional farms. Significantly more butterflies in both farming systems were recorded over the uncropped field margin than the crop edge. The difference in butterfly abundance between crop edge and field margin was relatively greater in conventional than organic systems. Species richness of butterflies tended to be greater on organic farms. Five species of butterfly were significantly more abundant on organic farms in at least 1 year, while no species was significantly more abundant on conventional farms. Organic and conventional cropping patterns differed, the former having proportionally more <b>grass</b> <b>leys,</b> and hedgerows were larger on organic farms. Although no significant effects of farming system on the numbers of grass or forb species present in the field margin or crop edge were detected, some individual plant species showed differences in frequency between organic and conventional field boundaries. Increasing the extent of organic farming, or practices associated with it, could help to restore biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. © 2007 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Cover or {{catch crops}} have {{beneficial}} effects for soil, water, erosion, etc. If harvested, {{they also provide}} feedstock for biogas without competition for arable land. The latter also applies to clover <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> or other residues on organic farms without ruminants and for manure. With an explorative approach, combining field experiments and data collection of practical implementation, we investigated achievable yields and identified recommendations for practical use. Gross energy yields of cover crops varied between 700 and 2000 m³ methane (CH 4) ha- 1 in Austria. The energy return on energy invested (EROI) ranges from 4 to 7, if biogas is upgraded and com¬pressed for biofuel use. Therefore, about 1000 m³ CH 4 ha- 1 are remaining as net energy yield from 4. 5 t of dry matter (DM). With an adequate harvesting process and a price of 85 € t- 1 DM cost-covering can be reached with about 4. 5 t DM ha- 1. If positive side effects are taken into account, 2. 5 t DM ha- 1 may be sufficient. Even if harvested and organic matter relevant for humification is returned with digestate, beneficial effects of cover crops on soil, water and climate may be improved. 7 – 16 % of the gross biogas yield of cover crops are sufficient for the entire production of cover and main crop from cultivation to harvest including transport. Therefore biogas enables organic farming without fossil fuels. Tractors fuelled with CH 4 to 70 – 80 % are already available...|$|E

For N, the total amounts applied (1992 - 96) were 0, 772, 807, 805 and 510 kg ha- 1 and for P 0, 141, 119, 143 and 107 kg ha- 1, respectively. In {{the first year}} (establishment of the ley, 1992 - 93), N losses (drainage + surface runoff) were slightly higher after application of slurry in autumn (with immediate ploughing, treatment 2) than in treatments 1, 4 and 5 (21 kg ha- 1 vs. 17 kg ha- 1), but the respective P losses (0. 7 - 0. 9 kg ha- 1) were not affected. During the ley years (1993 - 96) the N and P losses were increased by surface application of fertilizers and by abundance of surface runoff (83 - 100 % of the total runoff). Nutrient losses were extremely high after slurry application in autumn and winter, accounting for 11 % and 33 % of the applied N and 17 % and 59 % of the applied P, respectively. The N losses during the ley years from treatments 1 - 5 were 13, 62, 191, 23 and 24 kg ha- 1, where the proportion of NH 4 -N was 21, 49, 56, 33 and 39 %.

40|$|The {{positive}} effects on soil tilth from cropping and fertilisation are prone to destructive forces from traffic and tillage. This presentation provides results from a project aiming to quantify {{the relative importance of}} crop rotation, fertilisation and traffic/tillage and their interactions. The investigation includes a field trial established 1986 on loamy sand and another initiated 1997 on a sandy loam. All 1986 -trial plots are grown with annual cash crops. Annual incorporation of animal slurry and straw residues is compared to reference plots receiving no organic matter. In the 1997 -trial, a diversified crop rotation including <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> and catch crops is compared to a sequence of annual cash crops excluding catch crops. The latter treatment is performed with and without annual application of animal slurry. In both trials, half of all plots were mechanically compacted by tractor the year prior to investigation. The 1986 -trial also included part-plots intensively tilled with a rotary cultivator. Results obtained so far in the 1997 -trial indicate that soil organic carbon, microbial biomass, hyphal lengths and soil pore volume are significantly increased by manure application but especially by the diverse crop rotation. In contrast, clay dispersibility and wet aggregate stability were not significantly affected. Hence, biological soil attributes may serve as early indicators of soil quality changes. In the 1986 -trial, significant effects of the organic matter treatment were apparent for some biological (microbial biomass), chemical (total and hot-water extractable organic C) and physical (bulk soil strength and friability) attributes. The mechanical disturbance by compaction as well as by intensive tillage caused a significant reduction in soil friability though partly alleviated by the organic matter-treatment. ...|$|E

Also, the development in farm size is dramatic and as dairy farms grow bigger, an increasing number of farms cannot use the entire crop rotation for grazing.

40|$|Herbage {{production}} and utilization on Irish dairy farms is well below its potential. A {{number of factors}} influence herbage {{production and}} utilization, not least the level of annual reseeding (introduction of a new <b>grass</b> <b>ley)</b> on the farm. The potential farm performance is reduced by old permanent pasture due to the combined effects of reduced out-of-season herbage production and lower overall herbage yield when compared to perennial ryegrass. Based on the sales of grass seed, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 2 % of the land area on dairy farms in Ireland is reseeded annually. This has created a situation where the overall percentage of perennial ryegrass in sward is low. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the economic benefits of reseeding through simulating the consequences of reseeding different proportions of the farm on an annual basis. Four levels of an annual reseeding programme were evaluated: 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of the farm reseeded annually; evaluated at three milk prices (20 c/L, 27 c/L and 33 c/L). Increasing the level of reseeding resulted in an increase in total and seasonal herbage production and, when accompanied by an increased stocking rate, increased herbage utilization. At a milk price of 27 c/L, farm profitability was € 20 764, € 24 794, € 30 073 and € 33 515 on a 40 ha farm when 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively, of the farm was reseeded annually. Irrespective of milk price, increasing the level of reseeding had a positive effect on profitability and the highest gain was achieved at the highest milk price. Sensitivity analysis showed that sward persistency and, to a lesser extent, herbage utilization had significant effects on the benefit from reseeding. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} with different crop rotations and one conventional plant nutrient experiment are reported. In the crop rotation experiments nitrogen of different origin, organic or inorganic, was compared. In the plant nutrient experiment effects of {{different levels of}} NPK and lime were investigated. Annual off-take of nitrogen were strongly correlated with the crop, N-leve 1 and climate. Over the reported period which lasted 13 - 17 years the off-take varied from 50 to 160 kg ha-' yr-'. It was the lowest in a rotation with cash crops fertilized with 50 % of optimum N-rates. The highest value was observed in a rotation with grass leys and supply of manure twice during a six year period. The N efficiency was 65 to 120 % in systems based on both organic and inorganic N supply. In systems based solely on air-fixed N the N efficiency could not be satisfactory estimated. Over a 20 -year period the yields declined to 50 % when no NPK was applied in relation to normal NPK fertilization One of the {{experiments with}} different crop rotations and the NPKIlime experiment were placed on a nutrient deficient field. Immediate increase in soil P and K status was observed when fertilizer measures were taken. After 5 years with application of 32 kg P ha-' yr-' soil P status was improved from very poor to medium according to Swedish classification systems. Soil mineral N in autumn after ley harvest was 30 % of that after cereals. When the leys were ploughed the difference was levelled out. After luzern, however higher soil mineral N values were observed than after cereals. Each cropping system was drained separately. Annual transport of NO 3 -N was strongly influenced by the precipitation. The transport from the luzern was small but increased considerably when the ley was ploughed.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) flux {{simulations}} by four {{models were}} compared with year-round field measurements from five temperate agricultural sites in three countries. The field sites included an unfertilized, semi-arid rangeland with low N 2 O fluxes in eastern Colorado, USA; two fertilizer treatments (urea and nitrate) on a fertilized <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> cut for silage in Scotland; and two fertilized, cultivated crop fields in Germany where N 2 O loss during the winter was quite high. The models used were daily trace gas versions of the CENTURY model, DNDC, ExpertN, and the NASA-Ames version of the CASA model. These models included similar components (soil physics, decomposition, plant growth, and nitrogen transformations), {{but in some cases}} used very different algorithms for these processes. All models generated similar results for the general cycling of nitrogen through the agro-ecosystems, but simulated nitrogen trace gas fluxes were quite different. In most cases the simulated N 2 O fluxes were within a factor of about 2 of the observed annual fluxes, but even when models produced similar N 2 O fluxes they often produced very different estimates of gaseous N loss as nitric oxide (NO), dinitrogen (N 2), and ammonia (NH 3). Accurate simulation of soil moisture appears to be a key requirement for reliable simulation of N 2 O emissions. All models simulated the general pattern of low background fluxes with high fluxes following fertilization at the Scottish sites, but they could not (or were not designed to) accurately capture the observed effects of different fertilizer types on N 2 O flux. None of the models were able to reliably generate large pulses of N 2 O during brief winter thaws that were observed at the two German sites. All models except DNDC simulated very low N 2 O fluxes for the dry site in Colorado. The US Trace Gas Network (TRAGNET) has provided a mechanism for this model and site intercomparison.

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this work}} is the media discussion {{about the effect of}} cultivation on peat soils on greenhouse gas emissions. It has been argued that row sown and intensively cultivated crops such as carrots are more likely to emit carbon dioxide than for example <b>grass</b> <b>leys.</b> The association KRAV (an association promoting organic farming) shall, from this year adapt their environmental policy to be more climate smart and have asked the question if the cultivation of some crops is more climate smart than others? Carbon dioxide emissions from soil are due to degradation of organic material and the rate is controlled by microbial activity. The microbial activity is determined by a variety of factors such as temperature, soil organic matter quality and water content. I have measured the carbon dioxide emission from four different crops at two different farms. At Åloppe which is an organic farm, I have compared carbon dioxide emission from <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> and carrot grown on peat soil. At Ekhaga which is SLU's experimental farm for organic farming; I have compared spring wheat and potatoes grown on gyttja soil. The results show no significant difference in carbon dioxide emissions when growing these crops on organic soils. The emission levels where the same on both soil types. The amount of water in the soil and the temperature affect the carbon dioxide emission but the results are very uncertain. Biological systems usually have a peak activity range when all environmental factors are optimized, and so does this system. A moderate amount of water and air in the soil and a high enough soil temperature resulted in the highest carbon emission. I also studied how the above-ground biomass reflects the underground biomass, knowledge {{that can be used to}} get an idea of the crop root respiration. Because carbon dioxide emissions depend on many factors, you need to have a comprehensive view on cultivation practices. With an open mind you can go far in today's environmentally conscious society...|$|R
40|$|A rare thing: skylark nest in a {{conventional}} winter wheat crop The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the effects of differences in cropping pattern between organic and conventional arable farms on the breeding activity of skylarks and to assess the effects of arable crop management on skylark nest survival. Skylark nest density was seven times higher on organic farms than on conventional farms (0. 63 vs. 0. 09 nest per 10 ha.). Skylarks showed a strong preference for spring cereals, lucerne and <b>grass</b> <b>leys,</b> all of which were mainly or exclusively grown on organic farms. On organic farms nests were initiated during the entire breeding season, but on conventional farms no nesting activity was found during the peak of the season (early May to early June). On organic farms 27 % of all nests was successful. Increasing the availability of suitable breeding habitat during the peak of the breeding season on conventional farms might provide one means of enhancing breeding skylark populations. On organic farms, crop management should focus on reducing nest loss due to farming operations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} assess {{long-term}} effects on productivity, environmental impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared since 1989 on a loam soil. A decline in soil structure quality {{was found in a}} conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring, organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall increases in earthworm density (84...|$|R
40|$|Insight {{is needed}} into how {{management}} influences soil biota when sustainable grassland systems are developed. A crop rotation {{of grass and}} maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use. However, there is lack {{of information on the}} effect of such a crop rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment. Permanent arable land was compared with permanent grassland and with a ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of grassland (temporary grassland) was followed by a period of three years of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year <b>grass</b> <b>ley,</b> the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of permanent grassland in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species did not recover the dominance they had in the permanent grassland. The numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles in the permanent grassland remained different from the other treatments. Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well established in permanent grassland, are restored in a ley-arable crop rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable crop rotations were intermediate to permanent grassland and continuous arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g., N-mineralization). In terms of the functional aspects of the soil biota, permanent grassland might be preferable wherever possible. For maize cultivation, a ley-arable crop rotation is preferable to continuous arable land. However, a ley-arable crop rotation is only preferable to continuous arable cropping if it is not practised at the expense of permanent grassland at farm level...|$|E
40|$|Special Issue: The Use of {{vegetation}} for erosion control and environmental Protection. Metadata only. Erosion plot {{studies at the}} Hilton Experimental Site, Shropshire, UK, evaluated the effects of set-aside on runoff, erosion and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. Ten runoff plots (slope angles 7 - 15 °) were put to a <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> in April 1991. Runoff and erosion rates during nine years were low, despite the occurrence of potentially erosive rains. Mean runoff was 0 · 24 per cent of precipitation (SD = 0 · 20, n = 89 plot years), compared with a 15 -year mean value of 0 · 13 per cent (SD = 0 · 04) on permanent (control) grassland. The mean plot erosion rate was 0 · 21 t ha- 1 a- 1 (SD = 0 · 14, n = 69 plot years). Mean SOM content increased consistently and sign fi a tly on the set-aside plots, by a mean value of 1 · 07 per cent by weight (i. e. 1 · 07 g per 100 g of soil) in ten ye rs, from 2 · 04 per cent (1991) to 3 · 11 per cent (2001). Soil erodibility {{after six years of}} set-aside (sampling date 24 April 1997) was determined using a drip-screen rainfall simulator. Soil aggregate stability was higher on the grassed soils, compared with set-aside and bare arable soils. Despite no significant (P > 0 · 05) differences be w en grassland and set-asid oils, both these treatments were s gnificantly (P < 0 · 001) diff rent from bare soils. Contrary to the usually strong relationship between SOM and clay content, the percentage silt (r = 0 · 52, P < 0 · 001, n = 50) exhibited a stronger correlation with SOM than percentage clay content (r = 0 · 37, P < 0 · 01, n = 50). Furthermore, there were equally strong correlations between SOM and cumulative particle size fractions of both clay and silt contents (r = 0 · 51, P < 0 · 001, n = 50). In the absence of significant quantities of clay in these sandy soils, silts assist binding of SOM, which has significance for assessing soil carbon sequestration potential. Finally, future SOM and soil organic carbon benchmark work at the Hilton Site will improve harmonization of global SOM databases and enhance international estimates of rates and potential for soil carbon sequestration...|$|E
40|$|Winter {{oilseed rape}} {{can take up}} more {{nitrogen}} during autumn than cereal crops and requires high amounts of nitrogen (N) for maximum yield. In organic farming clover-grass leys are often the previous crop to winter oilseed rape since large amounts of nitrogen are mineralised during the autumn, after ploughing the ley, and the following growing season. Whether the Nsupply to winter oilseed rape is affected by harvesting the ley once or twice or keeping it as a green mulching crop are discussed in organic farming. Winter oilseed rape gives a good residual- N effect on the following crop but increased amounts of soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) is often found at harvest of oilseed rape and late autumn which increases the risk for N-losses during winter. Consequently {{there is a need}} to optimise the N-supply to winter oilseed rape and reduce the risk for N-losses. This is especially important in organic farming where N often is a limiting source. In five field trials (2001 - 2006) the effect of three treatments of a clover- <b>grass</b> <b>ley</b> (no harvest, one harvest, two harvests) on Nmin, net N-mineralisation, N-uptake and seed yield of organically grown winter oilseed rape (with and without application of dairy slurry in the spring) was studied. In the subsequent year the effect on Nmin, N-uptake and grain yield was studied in winter wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing) and in spring wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing, catchcrop/late ploughing and no catchcrop/late ploughing). Different amounts of above ground ley crop incorporated into the ground (in the three treatments) had no impact on oilseed rape seed production or Nmin in late autumn after ploughing the ley, in early spring or at harvest of the following winter oilseed rape. The reason for this could be that the roots are of more importance for the N-supply after leys and were most likely similar in all treatments. The impact of the slurry application to the winter oilseed rape was surprisingly small and increased yield with 300 kg ts/ha. In late autumn after harvest of oilseed rape Nmin was reduced by 50 % with catch crop (or spontaneously occurring crop) and late ploughing compared to where winter wheat was sown after early cultivation and ploughing or early cultivation followed by late ploughing. The results showed that catch crop (or spontaneous crop) and late ploughing (followed by spring wheat) were efficient methods to reduce the risk for N-losses after winter oilseed rape. Subsequent wheat yield was relatively high, indicating a sufficient N-supply, but was not affected by the ley treatments, slurry application or various soil cultivation (with or without catchcrop) after harvest of oilseed rape. Yield of winter and spring wheat was similar and with a price 0, 5 kr/kg higher for spring wheat, economically as well as environmentally the best choice of subsequent crop to winter oilseed rape was spring wheat...|$|E

40|$|After its {{introduction}} {{in the early}} 1960 s, maize (silage) became the largest arable crop in the Netherlands. It is often grown in monoculture or in rotation with <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> as in {{a large part of}} Europe too. Its introduction and monoculture induced weed shifts. Although initially not considered problematic, the C 4 species Setaria viridis and Digitaria ischaemum became more prominent due to changing crop husbandry systems since the mid 1990 s. Tolerance of these weeds to triazines and metolachlor forced farmers to adapt weed control strategies, i. e. use of herbicides with other modes of action. Also, reduced nutrient input, earlier sowing dates, and low tillage caused a slower early crop development and increased the need for adequate weed control in general. In today's herbicide portfolio in the Netherlands, control of S. viridis and D. ischaemum is marked as being most efficient with dimethenamide-P, isoxaflutole, S-metolachlor, and topramezone. The last one compound has a much higher degree of contact action than the predominant soil acting former three. This gives topramezone a rather unique position and, thus, Dutch crop advisors claim topramezone to be indispensable. In neighbouring countries the situation is comparable to the Dutch situation. In more Southern European countries (France, Spain) topramezone is not available, leading to a higher use of pre-emergence herbicide applications. The different weed control strategies for S. viridis and D. ischaemum, including non-chemical alternatives, are discussed together with economic aspects...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{economic}} {{life cycle of}} <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> with winter damage problems in northern Norway and the threshold of winter damage before it is profitable to re-seed grasses are investigated. The loss in profit of a sub-optimal strategy compared to an optimal strategy is briefly discussed. An infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programming model including a normally distributed yield process with possibilities for discrete downward jumps is developed. The jump process reflects the sudden drop in production after winter damage. Normally the yield of ley increases {{the first few years}} after a year with downward jump, and this dynamic is included in the model. The transition probabilities used in the model are estimated with Monte Carlo simulation. Our result show that, in the case of winter damage of 50 % or more compared to fields without winter damage, it is optimal to replace the ley immediately. If the winter damage is limited to 20 - 40 % of the yield of fields without winter damage, the replacement decision depends on the age of the ley and the current yield level. It does not always pay to replace immediately mildly winter damaged fields that are still producing high yields. It does not pay to replace a ley if there has been no winter damage since establishment and if the relative yield level is ‘satisfactory’ at least until the first episode of winter damage occurs.
