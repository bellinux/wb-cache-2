[...] And as he made no reply, {{smoothing}} his hat with his glove, she went on: [...] "Years ago, {{as much as you}} please I you had a good right, I don't deny, and you raved, in your letters, to your heart's content That's why I would n't see you; I did n't wish to take it full in the face. But that's all over now, time is a healer, you have cooled off, and by your own admission you have consoled yourself. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about temper! What in the world have I done to you, but let you alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' croaked the old woman, {{putting her}} face close to his, with a malevolent grin upon it that {{puckered}} up the loose skin {{down in her}} very throat. 'Do you deny your old chum! Have you lurked to my house fifty times, and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but the paving-stones, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me like this! Have I bought and sold with you, and helped you in my way of business, schoolboy, sneak, and what not, and do you tell me to go along? Could I raise a crowd of old company about you to-morrow morning, that would follow you to ruin like copies of your own shadow, and do you turn on me with your bold looks! I'll go.

6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} the creditors? You, at any rate, know the truth." [...] Then Augustus quitted the room, leaving his father in a passion. But, as a fact, he {{was by no means}} assured as to the truth. He {{supposed}} that he was the heir; but might it not be possible that his father had contrived all this so as to save the property from Mountjoy and that greedy pack of money-lenders? Grey must surely know the truth. But why should not Grey be deceived on the second event as well as the first. There was no limit, Augustus sometimes thought, to his father's cleverness. This idea had occurred to him within the last week, and his mind was tormented with reflecting what might yet be his condition. But of one thing he was sure, that his father and Mountjoy were not in league together. Mountjoy at any rate believed himself to have been disinherited. Mountjoy conceived that his only chance of obtaining money arose from his brother. The circumstances of Mountjoy's absence were, at any rate, unknown to his father.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{that the}} dear man Luther had but told us here {{what he meant}} by the term, Gospel! That St. Paul had seen even St. Luke's, is but a conjecture, {{grounded}} on a conjectural interpretation of a single text, doubly equivocal; namely, that the Luke mentioned was the same with the Evangelist Luke; and that the 'evangelium' signified a book; the latter, of itself improbable, derives its probability from the undoubtedly very strong probability of the former. If then not any book, much less the four books, now called the four Gospels, were meant by Paul, but the contents of those books, as far as they are veracious, and whatever else was known on equal authority at that time, though not contained in those books; if, in short, the whole sum of Christ's acts and discourses be what Paul meant by the Gospel; then the argument is circuitous, and returns to the first point,--What 'is' the Gospel? Shall we believe you, and not rather the companions of Christ, the eye and ear witnesses of his doings and sayings? Now I should require strong inducements to make me believe that St. Paul had been guilty of such palpably false logic; and I therefore feel myself compelled to infer, that by the Gospel Paul intended the eternal truths known ideally from the beginning, and historically realized in the manifestation of the Word in Christ Jesus; and that he used the ideal immutable truth as the canon and criterion of the oral traditions. For example, a Greek mathematician, standing in the same relation of time and country to Euclid as that in which St. Paul stood to Jesus Christ, might have exclaimed in the same spirit: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me of this, that, and the other intimate acquaintance of Euclid's? My object is to convey the sublime system of geometry which he realized, and by that must I decide." [...] "I," [...] says St. Paul, [...] "have been taught by the spirit of Christ, a teaching susceptible of no addition, and for which no personal anecdotes, however reverendly attested, can be a substitute." [...] But dearest Luther was a translator; he could not, must not, see this.|$|E

40|$|Background: Influenza {{vaccination}} coverage remains low among {{health care workers}} (HCWs) in many health facilities. This study describes the social network defined by HCWs’ conversations around an influenza vaccination campaign in order to describe {{the role played by}} vaccination behavior and other HCW characteristics in the configuration of the links among subjects. Methods This study used cross-sectional data from 235 HCWs interviewed after the 2010 / 2011 influenza vaccination campaign at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB), Spain. The study asked: “Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> or share some activity with respect to the seasonal vaccination campaign?” Variables studied included sociodemographic characteristics and reported conversations among HCWs during the influenza campaign. Exponential random graph models (ERGM) were used to assess the role of shared characteristics (homophily) and individual characteristics in the social network around the influenza vaccination campaign. Results Links were more likely between HCWs who shared the same professional category (OR 3. 13, 95...|$|R
