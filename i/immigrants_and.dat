40|$|Opportunity to {{participate}} in an out-of-school time program may be a meaningful support mechanism towards school success and healthy development for <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> refugee children. This study extends existing research on best practices by examining the on-the-ground experiences of supporting <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> refugee youth in out-of-school time programs. Findings from semi-structured interviews with program directors in 17 Massachusetts and New Hampshire programs suggest a number of program strategies that were responsive to the needs of <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> refugee students, including support for the use of native language as well as English, knowing about and celebrating the heritage of the students’ homeland, including on staff or in leadership individuals with shared <b>immigrant</b> background, <b>and</b> giving consideration to the academic priorities of parents. The development of such intentional approaches to working with <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> refugee youth during the out-of-school time hours will encourage enrollment of, and enhance effectiveness with, this vulnerable population...|$|R

It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly <b>immigrants,</b> <b>and</b> Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
