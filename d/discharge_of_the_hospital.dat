THE MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS FORTY YEARS AND THE MEN TO WOMAN RATIO WAS 2. 5. TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WERE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF INJURY (74 % OF THE CASES),FALLS ACCOUNTED FOR THE 19 % OF THE INJURIES AND OTHER CAUSES FOR THE REMAINING 7 %. THE NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT ON ARRIVAL AT THE HOSPITAL CATEGORIZED 17 % OF THE PATIENT AS FRANKEL A, 7 % AS FRANKEL B, 5 % AS FRANKEL C, 16 % AS FRANKEL D AND 55 % AS FRANKEL E. THE LENGTH OF HOSPITALIZATION FLUCTUATED GREATLY BETWEEN 2 DAYS AND 500 DAYS AND IT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF TREATMENT. THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF HOSPITALIZATION WAS 30 DAYS FOR THE PATIENTS WHO WERE TREATED CONSERVATIVELY AND 74 DAYS FOR THOSE WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY. THE NEUROLOGIAL ASSESSMENT ON <b>DISCHARGE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>HOSPITAL</b> SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM THE INITIAL ONE.

40|$|This study {{presented}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} key market, regulatory, organizational, operational and financial factors associated with hospital entry into joint venture (JV) arrangements with Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) as examined through the framework of resource dependency theory complimented with neo-institutional theory. This study used a cross sectional design to examine hospitals that entered into a joint venture arrangement with ASCs in 2006 and 2007. The {{data for this study}} were drawn from five main sources: the American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHA), the Area Resource File (ARF), the CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) minimum dataset, the National Legislative Assembly Website and the CM case-mix files. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to examine the association of various factors in this study. The study found that market factors such as unemployment rate and percentage of elderly were strongly associated with the hospitals decision to joint venture with ASCs. Also organizational size (measured by bed size) was a significant factor in these decisions. Other factors which showed a marginal significance were Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, number of ASCs, certificate of need laws, ownership status, and operating expense per adjusted <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> This research project sheds light on joint venture arrangements between hospitals and ASCs at a very opportune time. In light of the new Health Reform Legislation, studying hospital-ASC joint ventures is very important. For hospitals and ASCs, and their collaborative interests such as joint ventures, Accountable Care Organizations (ACO’s) could either provide incentives to help improve quality of care to patients or stint on needed care by making them focus narrowly on higher margin services (Fisher and Shortell 2010; Shortell and Casalino 2010). Since policy measures should encourage the first and not the second outcome, {{it is important to have}} a transparent performance measurement system that can win the confidence of the provider organizations such as hospitals and ASCs. Lacking which, it may discourage joint venture arrangements between hospitals and ASCs in future...|$|E
40|$|Stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} and the first cause of disability, in the {{developed}} countries and it is frequently described by the literature as a major global health problem. It is estimated that stroke is responsible for approximately 4. 5 million deaths per year and over 9 million stroke survivors, globally. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to review the literature about the consequences of functional disability that stroke imposes on the survivors’ life and to shortly describe functional instruments used in evaluation of stroke patients. The method οf this study included bibliography research from both the review and the research literature, mainly in the pub med data base which referred to the functional disability of stroke patients, as well as to the scales used for the evaluation of functional state. Results: Despite the accurate diagnosis and the recent therapeutic advances, stroke can still cause long-term disability in the majority of patients which induces significant changes between the patient and his environment. The results of recent studies indicate that the loss of independence that experience stroke survivals has significant consequences on their quality of life and it is likely to lead to family-crisis and social isolation. It is also widely accepted that the economic impact of stroke is considerable, worldwide. Recovery of functional disability after stroke is influenced by many variables, of which the main are the initial severity of stroke, the level of deficit and the level of social and family support. Ιn clinical practise many measurement instruments are applied and capable of providing assessments of functional ability and other related concepts since it is well documented that evaluation of functional state is a matter of great importance for the assessment of patients’ outcome. Conclusions: As it is supported by published evidence, rehabilitation of neurological deficit in conjunction with appropriate therapeutic interventions focused on the psychological, familial and social problems that face patients after the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> can significantly improve their quality of life...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe release <b>of</b> <b>hospital</b> {{wastewater}} into <b>the</b> urban sewer networks {{contributes to}} the general contamina- tion of aquatic media by pharmaceutical residues. These residues include bio-accumulative pharmaceu- ticals that lead to increased risk for ecosystems because they can concentrate in organisms and food chains, and therefore reach toxic levels. In order to assess the ecotoxicological risks linked to this partic- ular category of residues, we have developed a specific method, by combining a theoretical calculation of pollutant concentrations in organisms to estimate Body Residue (BR), and ecotoxicity biomarkers in fish cell lines, enabling <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> a Critical Body Residue (CBR). This method finally results in <b>the</b> cal- culation <b>of</b> a specific risk quotient (Qb = BR/CBR), characterizing the risk linked {{to this type of}} pollutant. This method was applied to mitotane, a bio-accumulative pharmaceutical typically found in <b>hospital</b> wastewater, in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> an exposure scenario corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> wastewaters into <b>the</b> Rhone River which flows through <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Lyon, France.

Patients’ satisfactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health care services were assessed using the translated and modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KQCAH consisted <b>of</b> 44 questions divided to 7 categories of Respect and Caring, Effectiveness and Continuity, Appropriateness, Information, Efficiency, Meals, First Impression, Staff Diversity. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients were asked to fill out the questionnaire (with written informed consents) at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Results: Regarding total score <b>of</b> patient satisfaction <b>the</b> ISO-certified <b>hospitals</b> did not show advantages over <b>the</b> uncertified <b>hospitals.</b> <b>The</b> total score <b>of</b> patients’ satisfaction ranged from 66. 5 to 77. 5 in. Overall, only in one ISO-certified <b>hospital</b> <b>the</b> total score <b>of</b> patient satisfaction representing all dimensions, was significantly higher comparing to other <b>hospitals</b> included in <b>the</b> study. Conclusion: It seems that solitary application of ISO standards could not improve patient satisfaction in hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences...|$|R
40|$|Reprints {{available}} through open access at www. westjem. org Objective: <b>The</b> accuracy <b>of</b> pre-hospital crash scene details and crash victim assessment {{has important implications}} for initial trauma care assessment and management. Similarly, it is known to influence physician perception of crash victim injury severity. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this feasibility study was to examine paramedic accuracy in predicting crash victim injury profile, disability outcome at hospital discharge, and reporting vehicle damage with other crash variables. Methods: This prospective case series study was undertaken at a Southern California, Level I trauma center certified by <b>the</b> American College <b>of</b> Surgeons. Paramedics transporting crash injured motor vehicle occupants to our emergency department (ED) /trauma center were surveyed. We abstracted ED and in-patient records of injured vehicle occupants. Vehicle and crash scene data were obtained from a professional crash reconstruction, which included <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> deformation, crash forces, change in velocity, and <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> each injury. Results: We used survey, injury, and crash reconstruction data from 22 collision cases in the final analysis. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was five (range 1 - 24). No enrolled patients died, and none were severely disabled at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> <b>The</b> paramedic cras...|$|R
40|$|Symptomatic arteriosclerotic {{occlusive}} disease {{involving the}} femoral and proximal popliteal arteries is currently best treated by reversed autogenous saphenous vein bypass graft. Severe occlusive disease frequently includes the popliteal and/or origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trifurcation vessels with reconstitution {{of one or}} more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessels in the lower leg. We have used distal bypass 97 times in 90 patients during the past decade. There was only one postoperative death in the series in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advanced age and concurrent disease in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients. Our indications for operation continue to be relief of pain or salvage of an extremity. We rely on high quality preoperative angiograms for selection of vessels to receive the bypass. The posterior tibial artery was used in 63 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases, while the anterior tibial and peroneal were used in 24 and 10 cases, respectively. There were 11 immediate inhospital failures in this series of 97 cases requiring amputation in five.

40|$|Transient ischemic attack · Stroke · Cost · Evaluation · Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging · Computed tomography Background: <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> neuroimaging for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> transient ischemic attack (TIA) is debatable. Many patients undergo head computed tomography (CT) {{with or without}} CT angiogram (CTA) while being at the emergency department (ED) and later magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) with MR angiogram (MRA) during admission. We hypothesized that evaluation with only one imaging modality (CT/CTA or MRI/MRA) is sufficient to formulate a treatment plan. We looked for the most cost-effective way to evaluate TIA patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 82 patients with TIA. All patients had complete-ly resolved neurological deficit at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> their evaluation in the ED. We divided the pa-tients into two groups. In group 1, the evaluation included CT with CTA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and neck. In group 2, the evaluation included brain MRI with MRA or CTA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and neck. We compared these two groups for clinical characteristics and etiological evaluations <b>of</b> stroke/ TIA. <b>The</b> outcomes were measured by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> therapeutic adjustments for <b>the</b> preven-tion <b>of</b> another ischemic stroke/TIA at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> and revascu-larization procedures.

40|$|Between August 1975 and January 1981, 106 {{patients}} {{thought to}} have persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism underwent a total of 108 parathyroid re-explorations at <b>the</b> National Institutes <b>of</b> Health. These 106 patients had a total of 175 previous operations for hyperparathyroidism (156 cervical and 19 mediastinal). Nephrolithiasis (54 % of patients) and bone disease (24 % o patients) were the predominant symptoms. Arteriographic examination and selective venous sampling provided highly accurate localizing results in 33 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients, and were of some help in 64 %. The final diagnoses after reoperation and re-evaluation were: single-gland disease in 58 patients, primary nonfamilial hyperplasia in 19 patients, familial hyperplasia in three patients, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) Type I in ten patients, MEN Type II in two, parathyroid carcinoma in four patients, secondary hyperplasia in three patients, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) in two patients. The diagnosis was in doubt in five patients. In the 95 patients with unequivocal hyperparathyroidism, not due to parathyroid carcinoma, surgery eliminated hypercalcemia in 91 (96 %). Two patients died after operation, one of disseminated candidiasis, and one patient, with an immunodeficiency, of sepsis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> {{allogeneic}} {{blood transfusion}} {{may relate to}} worse outcome in cardiac surgery. <b>The</b> reinfusion <b>of</b> red blood cells (RBCs) lost by patients, including those of chest drains, is a promising strategy to minimize allogeneic transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To verify this hypotheis, 1047 cardiac surgery patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either traditional intraoperative blood salvage followed by chest drain insertion or intra- and postoperative strategy with the Haemonetics cardioPAT system. Allogeneic RBC transfusion rate (primary endpoint) and postoperative complications (secondary endpoint) were recorded at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> and at first month follow-up visit, respectively. RESULTS: The cardioPAT arm received 1. 20 units of allogeneic RBCs per patient, whereas the control group required 2. 11 units per patient, and this difference proved to be highly significant (p= 0. 02). We observed a comparable 45 -day mortality rate but a lower rate of deep vein thrombosis (p= 0. 04) and atrial fibrillation (p= 0. 04) in the cardioPAT arm. DISCUSSION: A significant reduction in patient exposure to allogeneic RBCs was observed in the cardioPAT system arm. Complications were slightly less frequent in the cardioPAT group. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardioPAT is a safe and effective strategy to reduce allogeneic RBC transfusions in cardiac surgery...|$|R

Whether addition of corticosteroids to antiviral treatment benefits patients with varicella pneumonia is unclear. ObjectivesTo assess <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> dexamethasone as adjunctive therapy for treatment of varicella pneumonia on <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>hospital</b> stay, which might cause earlier resolution of varicella pneumonia. Patients and methodsForty patients were diagnosed as varicella pneumonia and divided into two groups, the first one involved 20 patients who received dexamethasone and acyclovir, and the second one involved also 20 patients but they received placebo and acyclovir. We measured liver function test, kidney profile, complete blood count, blood glucose, C-reactive protein and <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> interleukin- 6 on <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> presentation, after 4 days of admission and on <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> ResultThe mean length <b>of</b> <b>hospital</b> stay in <b>the</b> dexamethasone group was 6. 5 days compared with 7. 1 days in the placebo group and was significantly different between two groups. <b>The</b> mean time <b>of</b> switching to oral administration of acyclovir was 3. 4 days in the dexamethasone group and 4. 2 days in the placebo group. <b>The</b> mean time <b>of</b> switching to oral was significantly lower in dexamethasone group than in placebo group.

40|$|Abstract Drowning is a {{major source}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity in children worldwide. Neurocognitive outcome of children after drowning incidents cannot be accurately predicted in <b>the</b> early course <b>of</b> treatment. Therefore, aggressive out-of-hospital and in-hospital treatment is emphasized. There are "miracle" cases after long submersion times that {{have been reported in the}} medical literature, which mostly concern small children. However, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors will remain severely neurologically compromised after remarkably shorter submersion times and will consequently be a great burden to their family and society for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> their lives. <b>The</b> duration <b>of</b> submersion, <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> advanced life support at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room are important factors related to survival with mild neurological deficits or intact function in drowned children. Data on long-term outcome are scarce. The used outcome measurement methods and <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> follow-up have not been optimal in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing studies. Proper neurological and neurophysiological examinations for drowned children are superior to outcome scales based chart reviews. There is evidence that gross neurological examination at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in young children does not reveal all the possible sequelae related to hypoxic brain injury and thus long-term follow-up of drowned resuscitated children is strongly recommended. </p...|$|R
