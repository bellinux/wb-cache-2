40|$|Abstract: The {{co-disposal}} of <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> {{and municipal}} solid waste may cause significant impacts (such as total and differential settlement, slope stability of the waste, and leachability) on landfill operations and the subsurface environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the co-disposal of <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and {{municipal solid waste}} with respect to their consolidation characteristics, vane shear strength, and leachability. The results of the consolidation tests show that, for a given stress increment, the deformation (the change in the void ratio) of the <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> is larger than the deformation of its sludge mixtures. When the sludge ratio in the mixture increases, the compressibility of the mixture increases. The total consolidation settlement taking place in landfilling of <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> alone would be much greater than that for co-disposal of sludge with solid waste. The results of the shear stress strength tests of the sludge and its mixtures imply that side slopes of 20 º can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing a sliding problem. Based on the results of the column leachability tests, Fe, Cu and nitrogen leached out from the sludge and its mixture might cause groundwater pollution. ...|$|R

40|$|Sludges {{resulting}} from wastewater treatment processes have a characteristically high water content, which complicates handling operations such as pumping, transport and disposal. To enhance the dewatering of secondary sludge, {{the effect of}} ultrasound waves, thermal treatment and chemical conditioning with NaOH have been studied. Two features of treated sludges were examined: their rheological behavior and their dewaterability. The rheological tests consisted of recording shear stress when the shear rate increases and decreases continuously and linearly with time, and when it increases and decreases in steps. Steady-state viscosity and thixotropy {{were obtained from the}} rheological tests, and both decreased significantly in all cases with increased treatment intensity. Centrifugation of ultrasonicated and thermally treated sludges allowed the total solid content to be increased by approximately 16. 2 % and 17. 6 %, respectively.

Among the indexes tested, oxygen uptake rate (also referred to as dynamic respirometric index) provided the most reliable values of microbial activity in a compost environment. On the other hand, values of the static respirometric index measured at process temperature, especially {{in the early stages}} of the composting process, were significantly lower than those of the dynamic index, which was probably due to oxygen diffusion limitations present in static systems. Both static and dynamic indexes were similar during the maturation phase. Static respirometric index measured at 37 °C should not be used with samples obtained during the thermophilic phase, since it resulted in an underestimation of the respiration values. Respiratory quotient presented only slight variations when changing the process temperature or the waste considered, and its use should be restricted to ensure aerobic conditions in the composting matrix...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of increasing quantities of <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> in landfills may cause geoenvironmental {{problems such as}} leachability, total and differential settlement, slope stability of landfill sites and leachate contaminations. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the geotechnical, physio-chemical and leaching properties of the <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> generated from chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) plant at Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong, and to assess the feasibility of sludge disposal in landfills. With regard to the geotechnical aspect of <b>dewatered</b> CEPT <b>sludge,</b> it is characterized by high water contents, high organic content, and high compressibility. Compaction test results show that CEPT sludge exhibits compaction characteristics similar to clayey soils. However, the lowest hydraulic conductivity of CEPT sludge does not occur at 3 % wet of its optimum water content. Pore water pressure dissipation of sludge during consolidation does not follow Terzaghi's theory probably due to its fibrous microstructure. Under an overburden pressure higher than 24 kPa, the relationship between the logarithm-of-hydraulic conductivity (log k) and void ratio (e) is linear. Results from the direct shear strength tests reveal that slopes of 20 ° can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing any sliding problems. Compared with the {{disposal of}} pure CEPT sludge, the co-disposal of <b>dewatered</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> with municipal solid wastes results in a lower compressibility, a smaller settlement, but a higher hydraulic conductivity. On the other hand, from the environmental point of view, experimental results from four bench-scale column tests show that leachate from landfill disposal of CEPT sludge is characterized by high nitrogen, Fe and Cd content, which exceed the drinking water standard. Sludge compacted at a lower water content generates leachate with a higher concentration and a higher leaching rate than sludge compacted at its natural water content. If CEPT sludge is disposed in landfills, Cr, Fe, Zn and Cu might be released at a higher rate than other metals in its leachate. Compared with the disposal of pure CEPT sludge in landfills, the co-disposal of sludge with solid wastes has higher average leaching rates of Kjeldahl-N and metals, but a lower biodegradation rate...|$|R

The critical state model for soils provided a good fit for the characteristics relationship between vane shear strength and total solids, which can be used to estimate vane shear strength from total solids only. No relationship between volatile solids and vane shear strength was found. The results of the laboratory vane shear test correlated well with those obtained by a pocket shearmeter indicating the usefulness of this method for rapid determination of vane shear strength on site.
