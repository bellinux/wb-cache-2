50|$|A bread-like dish {{similar to}} the calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a {{descendant}} of the Genoese dish with the same name. Unlike calentita the ingredients are first simmered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> for <b>over</b> <b>an</b> hour, stirring constantly, to form a paste which is then left to set. When the polenta-like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{domestic}} preparation regimes {{on the level}} of the heat-formed toxicant furan was studied to provide useful information for exposure assessment and advice for manufacturers and consumers. Foods were cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> on <b>a</b> gas hob, or microwaved and furan determined by headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general furan levels did not decrease as much when foods were cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> microwave when compared to the same foods cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b> Furan levels decreased in most canned and jarred foods after heating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b> Low levels of furan in soups in cartons were not changed by any procedure. Furan decreased slightly in foods on standing before consumption but did so more rapidly on stirring. The levels also decreased slightly when foods were left to stand on plates, this observation is attributed to the volatility of furan...|$|R

50|$|Preparing a quick bread {{generally}} involves two mixing containers. One {{contains all}} dry ingredients (including chemical leavening agents or agent) and one contains all wet ingredients (possibly including liquid ingredients that are slightly acidic {{in order to}} initiate the leavening process). In some variations, the dry ingredients are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl and the wet ingredients are heated sauces <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> off-heat and cooled.|$|R

60|$|Poor Charley, I {{wonder what}} could have {{made me think of}} him in {{connection}} with heroes; his lovableness, I suppose--certainly not his heroic qualities.

I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> lid <b>over</b> the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.|$|R

5000|$|This typical Guadeloupean food {{started to}} develop in the mid-19th century after the {{abolition}} of slavery. At this time, the poorest workers could not even buy {{some of the basic}} products such as bread. As they were good observers and resourceful, they had the idea to adapt and produce a bread by themselves, without yeast at this time, and cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> with hot oil that they used to call [...] "kettle bread" [...] because of the vapor going out of it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} {{next morning when}} Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other {{person in the room}} but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> for breakfast, and {{whistling}} softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.|$|R
50|$|The {{second and}} newer type of pudding {{consists}} of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca {{to create a}} sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmering {{on top of the}} stove <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> or double boiler or by baking <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oven, often <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bain-marie. These puddings are easily scorched on the fire, which is why a double boiler is often used; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring.|$|R
50|$|Custard {{is usually}} cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> on <b>a</b> stove, though custard {{can also be}} steamed, baked in the oven {{with or without a}} water bath, or even cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{pressure}} cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation, because a temperature increase of 3-6 °C (5-10 °F) leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °C (176 °F); it begins setting at 70 °C (158 °F). A water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the meat}} is cut and flattened, it is placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{marinade}} consisting of yogurt, chili powder, and numerous spices and seasonings, which commonly include cumin, peppercorn, cardamom, and garlic. After {{a few hours of}} marination, {{the meat is}} placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> with the other ingredients that make up the [...] "pasanda" [...] itself—onions, coriander, chillies, and sometimes cinnamon or black pepper—then fried for 30 minutes to an hour. The dish may be garnished with tomatoes or almonds (in which case it is known as badaam pasanda). It is often served with white rice or naan bread on the side.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the dish, Bramley {{apples are}} {{generally}} cooked {{in the same}} basic way. First the fruit is peeled and then sliced, and the pieces covered in lemon juice (or some other acidic juice) to stop them turning brown. Sugar is usually added. In pies and crumbles, the fruit is simply covered with the topping and baked; the moisture in the apples is sufficient to soften them while cooking. The flavour may be spiced, according to taste, with cloves or cinnamon. To make apple sauce, the apples are sliced and then stewed with sugar and lemon juice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b>|$|R
