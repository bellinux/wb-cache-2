30|$|Secure {{deletion}} {{is used to}} securely dispose data {{once they}} become obsolete. This requires a security deletion guarantee that the adversary should neither recover the <b>deleted</b> <b>data,</b> nor learn anything about them (“Secure deletion” section). The question is, can we achieve the secure deletion guarantee by simply <b>deleting</b> the <b>data</b> themselves? The answer is unfortunately no. Conventional secure deletion approaches rely on either overwriting or encryption to make the <b>deleted</b> <b>data</b> inaccessible. However, the past existence of the <b>deleted</b> <b>data</b> may leave artifacts in the layout at all layers of a computing system (Bajaj and Sion 2013 b; Chen and Sion 2015) or create side effects on the other data which have not been deleted (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a), and the adversary can potentially take advantage of those structural artifacts or side effects to learn sensitive information about the <b>deleted</b> <b>data</b> (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a, b; Chen and Sion 2015).|$|R

30|$|To protect {{confidentiality}} of the <b>data</b> <b>deleted</b> from a computing device, the <b>deleted</b> <b>data</b> {{should be made}} completely unrecoverable. Conventionally, this is ensured by carefully over-writing the storage medium storing the data using garbage information (Joukov and Zadok 2005; Wei et al. 2011; Garfinkel and Shelat 2003; Sun et al. 2008; Gutmann 1996) or deploying encryption using ephemeral keys (Perlman 2005 a, b, Geambasu et al. 2009, Tang et al. 2012, Reardon et al. 2012, Zarras et al. 2016). This unfortunately was shown to be insufficient, since past existence of the <b>deleted</b> <b>data</b> will create impacts on both the data organization (Bajaj and Sion 2013 b) and the other data which have not been deleted (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a). Those impacts can then be utilized by the adversary as an oracle to derive sensitive information about the <b>deleted</b> <b>data.</b> In the worst case, the adversary is able to completely recover the <b>data</b> being <b>deleted</b> (Chen et al. 2016). Therefore, recent secure deletion approaches focus on eliminating those impacts (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a, b, Chen and Sion 2015; Chen and Sion 2016; Jia et al. 2016).|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{methods for}} <b>deleting</b> <b>data</b> {{permanently}} from a storage device involve overwriting its whole content with zeros, ones or other patters - {{a process which}} can take {{a significant amount of}} time, depending on the capacity and the type of the medium. Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous, as long as all data on a device is encrypted and the key is stored on the same device. Although this setup on its own does not offer any protection in case an unauthorised person gains physical access to the device, it means that all information on it can be made inaccessible by erasing only the key. An example implementation of this method can be found on iOS devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated 'Effaceable Storage'.|$|E
