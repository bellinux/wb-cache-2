5|$|People {{receiving}} <b>dimercaprol</b> need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of <b>dimercaprol.</b> Administering <b>dimercaprol,</b> DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. <b>Dimercaprol</b> used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, <b>dimercaprol</b> (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. <b>Dimercaprol</b> was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and <b>dimercaprol</b> sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), <b>dimercaprol</b> (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include <b>dimercaprol,</b> edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{molecules}} {{that serve as}} chelator agents that bond to arsenic. These three are British Anti-Lewisite (BAL, <b>Dimercaprol),</b> succimer (DMSA) and Unithiol (DMPS).|$|E
25|$|Other {{chelating}} agents can be used, but may cause more side effects than British Anti-Lewisite (BAL, <b>Dimercaprol),</b> succimer (DMSA) and (DMPS). DMPS and DMSA {{also have a}} higher therapeutic index than BAL.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is {{by using}} water {{that does not}} contain high levels of arsenic. This may be {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} special filters or using rainwater. There is not good evidence to support specific treatments for long-term poisoning. For acute poisonings treating dehydration is important. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) may be used while <b>dimercaprol</b> (BAL) is not recommended. Hemodialysis may also be used.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} arsenic {{poisoning}} is possible. British anti-lewisite (<b>dimercaprol)</b> is prescribed in doses of 5mg/kg up to 300mg every 4hours {{for the first}} day, then every 6hours for the second day, and finally every 8hours for 8 additional days. However the USA's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that {{the long-term effects of}} arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Long-term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.|$|E
25|$|Chelation {{therapy for}} acute {{inorganic}} mercury poisoning {{can be done}} with DMSA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), D-penicillamine (DPCN), or <b>dimercaprol</b> (BAL). Only DMSA is FDA-approved for use in children for treating mercury poisoning. However, several studies found no clear clinical benefit from DMSA treatment for poisoning due to mercury vapor. No chelator for methylmercury or ethylmercury is approved by the FDA; DMSA is the most frequently used for severe methylmercury poisoning, as it is given orally, has fewer side-effects, and {{has been found to be}} superior to BAL, DPCN, and DMPS. α-Lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to be protective against acute mercury poisoning in several mammalian species when it is given soon after exposure; correct dosage is required, as inappropriate dosages increase toxicity. Although it has been hypothesized that frequent low dosages of ALA may have potential as a mercury chelator, studies in rats have been contradictory. Glutathione and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are recommended by some physicians, but have been shown to increase mercury concentrations in the kidneys and the brain.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that chelation agents, such as British Anti-Lewisite (<b>dimercaprol),</b> can be used to decontaminate humans. In one experiment, rats were given a fatal dose of 1.45MBq/kg (8.7ng/kg) of 210Po; ...|$|E
50|$|British anti-lewisite, {{also called}} <b>dimercaprol,</b> is the {{antidote}} for lewisite. It can be injected to prevent systemic toxicity, {{but will not}} prevent injury to the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Chemically, <b>dimercaprol</b> binds to the arsenic in lewisite. It is contraindicated in those with peanut allergies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dimercaprol</b> and {{dimercaptosuccinic acid}} are {{chelating}} agents that sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins {{and are used}} in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most important side effect is hypertension. <b>Dimercaprol</b> is considerably more toxic than succimer.DMSA monoesters, e.g. MiADMSA, are promising antidotes for arsenic poisoning. Calcium sodium edetate is also used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimercaprol</b> {{has been}} found to form stable chelates in vivo with many other metals {{including}} inorganic mercury, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, gold, and nickel. However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals. <b>Dimercaprol</b> has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects. Although treatment with <b>dimercaprol</b> will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided. It does, however, remove inorganic mercury from the kidneys; but is not useful in the treatment of alkylmercury or phenyl mercury toxicity. <b>Dimercaprol</b> also enhances the toxicity of selenium and tellurium, so it is not to be used to remove these elements from the body.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dimercaprol</b> {{has long}} been the {{mainstay}} of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning, and it remains an essential drug. Nonetheless, because it can have serious adverse effects, researchers have also pursued development of less toxic analogues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimercaprol</b> {{is itself}} toxic, {{with a narrow}} {{therapeutic}} range and a tendency to concentrate arsenic in some organs. Other drawbacks include the need to administer it by painful intramuscular injection. Serious side effects include nephrotoxicity and hypertension.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dimercaprol</b> {{was first}} made during World War II. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. In the United States a course of treatment costs more than 200 USD.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include high blood pressure, pain {{at the site}} of injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not {{recommended}} in people with peanut allergies. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. <b>Dimercaprol</b> works by binding with heavy metals.|$|E
50|$|Arsenic {{and some}} other heavy metals act by {{chemically}} reacting with adjacent thiol residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a chelate complex that inhibits the affected enzyme's activity. <b>Dimercaprol</b> competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimercaprol,</b> {{also called}} British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead.

50|$|In {{cases of}} {{suspected}} copper poisoning, penicillamine is the drug of choice, and <b>dimercaprol,</b> a heavy metal chelating agent, is often administered.

50|$|Treatment {{for lead}} {{poisoning}} normally involves {{the administration of}} <b>dimercaprol</b> and succimer. Acute cases may {{require the use of}} disodium calcium edetate, the calcium chelate of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). It has a greater affinity for lead than calcium, with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine, leaving behind harmless calcium.|$|E

50|$|Sodium calcium edetate (sodium calcium EDTA), {{also known}} as edetate calcium {{disodium}} among other names, is a medication primarily used to treat lead poisoning. This includes short term and long term lead poisoning. For lead encephalopathy it is typically used together with <b>dimercaprol.</b> It {{does not appear to}} be useful for tetraethyllead toxicity. It is given by slow injection into a vein or into a muscle.|$|E
50|$|Soluble {{compounds}} (gold salts) such as {{gold chloride}} are toxic to {{the liver and}} kidneys. Common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide, used in gold electroplating, are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content.
