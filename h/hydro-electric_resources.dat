The publication Energy Economics estimates that replacing South African coal power with hydroelectric imported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could save 40 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.Africa is protecting forest resources. “USAID will contribute approximately $48 million to partnership through its successful Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE)…goal is to improve forest governance, develop sustainable means of livelihood for 60 million {{people who live in}} the Basin, reduce the rate of forest degradation and loss of biodiversity through protected area management, improve logging policies, and achieve sustainable forest use by local inhabitants.” ...|$|E
50|$|More than 95% of Quebec's {{territory}} {{lies within}} the Canadian Shield. It is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points {{such as the}} Laurentian Mountains in southern Quebec, the Otish Mountains in central Quebec and the Torngat Mountains near Ungava Bay. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay {{in parts of the}} Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resources</b> that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. Primary industries sustain small cities in regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and Côte-Nord.|$|E
500|$|Scotland has 85% of the UK's <b>hydro-electric</b> energy <b>resource,</b> {{much of it}} {{developed}} by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in the 1950s. The [...] "Hydro Board", which brought [...] "power from the glens", was a nationalised industry at the time although it was privatised in 1989 and {{is now part of}} Scottish and Southern Energy plc.|$|R

[...] Dale and Vaksdal are industrial villages that arose around factories utilising the <b>hydro-electric</b> power <b>resources</b> {{provided by the}} mountainous terrain and rainy climate. The Bergensbanen railway line between Norway's two largest cities Oslo and Bergen, and the main road between the same two cities, European route E16, run through Vaksdal municipality.

40|$|The Saguenay - Lake Saint-Jean {{region was}} only settled {{during the past}} one hundred years but now {{contains}} a population of approximately 260, 000 (1961). This rapid growth of population is explained in great measure by an exceptionally high rate of natural increase. Much urbanisation bas recently occurred, particularly in the upper Saguenay area where the conurbation consisting of Chicoutimi, Jonquiere, Kénogami, Arvida, Bagotville and Port-Alfred now bas a population of over 110, 000. The regional economy is based {{to a certain extent}} upon agriculture, with a specialisation in dairy farming. However, the principal emphasis is upon the aluminium and paper industries, which are supported by the great local <b>hydro-electric</b> power <b>resources.</b> The local economy is, however, dangerously subject to fluctuations of the international market...|$|R
40|$|The Central Plateau {{region of}} the State - the lake country of Tasmania - has {{undoubtedly}} been responsible 183 for sparking the enthusiasm that had led to the extensive development of the <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resources</b> of this State. This enthusiasm resulted from the obviously favourable characteristics of the area for power development - good rainfall, cheap storage sites and favourable topography for developing suitable "drops" for power development. Furthermore, these resources were all located in relatively accessible areas. In reviewing the power development on the Plateau it is proposed to deal first with those aspects of the climate {{of particular interest to}} the water resources of the area and then deal with the manner in which these water resources have been used to date and may be used in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} power industry {{is facing the}} prospect of integrating a significant addition of variable generation technologies {{in the next several}} decades, primarily from wind and solar facilities. Overall, transmission and generation reserve levels are decreasing and power system infrastructure in general is aging. To maintain grid reliability modernization and expansion of the power system as well as more optimized use of existing resources will be required. Conventional and pumped storage hydroelectric facilities can provide an increasingly significant contribution to power system reliability by providing energy, capacity and other ancillary services. However, the potential role of hydroelectric power will be affected by another transition that the industry currently experiences - the evolution and expansion of electricity markets. This evolution to market-based acquisition of generation resources and grid management is taking place in a heterogeneous manner. Some North American regions are moving toward full-featured markets while other regions operate without formal markets. Yet other U. S. regions are partially evolved. This report examines the current structure of electric industry acquisition of energy and ancillary services in different regions organized along different structures, reports on the current role of hydroelectric facilities in various regions, and attempts to identify features of market and scheduling areas that either promote or thwart the increased role that hydroelectric power can play in the future. This report {{is part of a larger}} effort led by the Electric Power Research Institute with purpose of examining the potential for hydroelectric facilities to play a greater role in balancing the grid in an era of greater penetration of variable renewable energy technologies. Other topics that will be addressed in this larger effort include industry case studies of specific conventional and hydro-electric facilities, systemic operating constraints on <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resources,</b> and production cost simulations aimed at quantifying the increased role of hydro...|$|E
40|$|Generally, we hear such {{questions}} as "what is the magnitude of our oil sardine or mackerel resources?" "Can we get more catch from these resources?" It is, therefore, proper that we carefully examine {{what is meant by}} a fishery resource e. g., oil sardine or mackerel resource. A fishery resource is just like any other natural resource (e. g., mineral <b>resource,</b> <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resource</b> etc.) which is exploited by man. But at the same time, it differs considerably to character from other types like mineral resources. The coal resource in a region is limited in magnitude, even though sometimes we do not know the magnitude. From this fixed resource we can exploit at any desired rate. The resource will be completely exhausted after a period of time depending on the rate of exploitation. In this sense a mineral resource can be described as a non-renewable natural resource which is liable to get exhausted after some period of time. It is also a static resource because we always know how much of the resource remains, once we know how much has been removed. A fishery resource is very much different in character. It is a self-regulating renewable natural resource. Consider a fish population occupying a certain area of the sea. Now when a certain portion of the population is removed, the remaining portion in the habitat gets better food, more area to move about, and this results in faster growth rate, lesser mortality rates and also the spawns get better chance of survival- The result is that the resource resuscitates itself quickly. Apart from fishing, the population is also affected by many other fishery-independent environmental factors such as available food supply, change in salinity, temperature of the water, change in ocean-currents etc. Thus the fishery resource is a dynamic resource, ever changing due to impact of fishing and other fishery-independent factors...|$|R
40|$|For {{years the}} Treasure Valley has enjoyed {{relatively}} cheap energy {{due to its}} ample <b>Hydro-electric</b> and geothermal <b>resources,</b> but as the population continues to grow and businesses continue to expand, more electric power {{will be required to}} sustain growth. Energy within this region is not limitless and new energy sources will not be cheap. Electric power needed to meet the rising demand of the Treasure Valley will be difficult to achieve. Our objective is to research how the Treasure Valley can cope with the rising demand for energy. We will first determine new energy resources available to the valley. We will also investigate which energy firms have already begun to invest in the Treasure Valley, and what impact their investments could have on the future of firm growth. Our research will focus on the following factors: • The amount of energy currently available • Prospective energy sources • How limitations on current energy, and barriers for new energy, affect new firms entering the treasure valley market. We expect to find that like many growing cities throughout our nation, the Treasure Valley will soon reach a limit on how much it can sustain due to a restriction in available energy. We also expect to find that this problem will occur soon, requiring us to invest in new and existing energy firms, allowing them to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand...|$|R
