5000|$|Multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) is a {{variation}} of CMOS chip technology which has transistors with multiple threshold voltages (Vth) in order to optimize delay or power. The Vth of a MOSFET is the gate voltage where an inversion layer forms at the interface between the insulating layer (oxide) and the substrate (body) of the transistor. Low Vth devices switch faster, and are therefore useful on critical delay paths to minimize clock periods. The penalty is that low Vth devices have substantially higher static leakage power. High Vth devices are used on non-critical paths to reduce static leakage power without incurring a <b>delay</b> <b>penalty.</b> Typical high Vth devices reduce static leakage by 10 times compared with low Vth devices.|$|E

Since the driver sizing solution and the buffer insertion solution affect each other, sub-optimal solutions may result if these techniques are applied sequentially instead of simultaneously. We show how to simply extend van Ginneken’s buffer insertion algorithm to simultaneously incorporate driver sizing and introduce the idea of a <b>delay</b> <b>penalty</b> to encapsulate the effect of driver sizing on the previous stage. The <b>delay</b> <b>penalty</b> can be pre-computed efficiently via dynamic programming.
