500|$|On {{the morning}} of the {{scheduled}} flight, the day before the concert, on 12 September, Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were not at the airport. At this point, Clapton had not been aware of the concert, nor of Lennon contacting him. Brower had managed to get through to Clapton and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got [...] "a phone call on the <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour." [...] The group had two rehearsals: one was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, and the other shortly before appearing on stage at the actual festival. Lennon said the group [...] "didn't know what to play", as they had not previously performed together. Also on the flight, Lennon gained the confidence, that when he got back to England, to leave the Beatles. Lennon told this to Clapton, and shortly afterwards, to the Beatles' then-manager, Allen Klein.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} the Jamaica Gleaner noted that viewers had been getting restless with Jill's newfound {{closeness}} to Katherine, noting that, [...] "Katherine and Jill {{are at their}} best when they are at each other's throats." [...] Of the storyline where she returned to Jabot Cosmetics, Cooper stated: [...] "Since I {{went back into the}} business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [...] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'" [...] Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has [...] "outlived most marriages". Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. [...] It used to be, “This month I like her... this month I hate her.” [...] Now, it’s more from moment to moment." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{preparing}} {{it on his}} Logic recording software, Bilal recorded A Love Surreal in five months, {{which he}} said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Prime Rib Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play {{when he entered the}} studio, but, according to him, [...] "it was just so easy that the music started to flow ... by the fifth <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> like 'damn, we made a mistake and wrote five extra songs". He worked with most of the recording crew from Airtight's Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his 2001 debut 1st Born Second to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for the album's sound.|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new <b>day</b> ... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} album: [...] "When we finally did {{come back to}} record again, {{it was based on}} market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2001 season, Maryland hired a {{new head}} coach, Ralph Friedgen, who {{engineered}} a first-year turnaround for the program. During summer training camp, Gary took an awkward hit and suffered a cervical spine injury. He was evacuated to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, but fully recovered. Against sixth-ranked Georgia Tech, Gary made a critical 18-yard reception to the Yellow Jackets' 46-yard line with 40seconds left {{as part of}} a drive to push within field goal range. Nick Novak later kicked the tying field goal, and in overtime, kicked the game-winner. The win improved the Terps' record to 6–0 and secured bowl eligibility for Maryland {{for the first time since}} 1991. Against Virginia, Gary recorded five receptions for 99 yards and a 53-yard touchdown. In the penultimate regular season game, 13th-ranked Maryland played Clemson at Byrd Stadium. Gary recorded five receptions for 93yards and a touchdown, and the Terrapins won, 37–20, to ensure at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship with Florida State. The following week, Maryland played its last conference game against NC State. In the final minutes of regulation, with Maryland trailing, quarterback Shaun Hill mounted a 61-yard drive. It culminated with an eight-yard pass to Gary in the corner of the end zone to win the game, 23–19, with 41seconds remaining. The win secured the outright ACC championship. Throughout the season, Gary was quarterback Shaun Hill's preferred receiver, and led the balanced Maryland receiving corps. Gary recorded 49receptions, 727yards, and six touchdowns. He was the first Maryland player since Gary Collins in 1961 to lead the team in receptions in three consecutive seasons. Gary was named an All-ACC player, which made him the first Maryland receiver honored as such since 1995. About that championship-winning season, Gary said in 2009:"Every <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> told we were nothing. Every <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> told we were picked to finish seventh in the conference for a reason. Really, we don't have a lot of fond football memories. My [...] has a thick coat of dust on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One <b>day</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E
