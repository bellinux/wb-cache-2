5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{morphology}} of the mandibles, scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that Brownimecia {{may have had}} a high level of feeding specialization.|$|E
50|$|Bopearachchi <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that Menander II reigned c. 90-85 BCE, whereas R. C. Senior <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> c. 65 BCE. In that case, Menander II ruled {{remaining}} Indo-Greek territories in Gandhara {{after the}} invasion of Maues.|$|R
50|$|Yanomaman {{is usually}} not {{connected}} with any other language family. Joseph Greenberg <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> a relationship between Yanomaman and Macro-Chibchan. Migliazza (1985) <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> a connection with Panoan and Chibchan. Neither proposal has been accepted.|$|R
50|$|For acute {{low back}} pain, low quality {{evidence}} <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> {{no difference between}} real and sham spine manipulation, and moderate quality evidence <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> no difference between spine manipulation and other commonly used treatments, such as medication and physical therapy.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Steiner's original account of throffers, other authors <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> definitions and {{ideas on how}} to differentiate throffers from threats and offers.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro. While some studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> the attributable risk, if any, is slight.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> alternative scenarios for the crime, or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case.|$|E
5000|$|Alternative terms {{have been}} offered: Milton Diamond <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> {{the use of}} [...] "variation" [...] or of [...] "difference", Elizabeth Reis <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> [...] "divergence"; Liao and Simmonds suggest [...] "diverse sex development". The latter {{suggestions}} would retain the initial D in DSD.|$|R
50|$|Christian Settipani <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> the Martiniakos {{family could}} share common ancestry with the Phrygian Dynasty, {{allowing}} descendants some {{claim to the}} throne. He <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> the relation may be {{through one of the}} sisters of dynasty founder Michael II. The origins of the dynasty are poorly recorded.|$|R
25|$|Wilson <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> two {{versions}} of this statistic.|$|R
5|$|Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that Daspletosaurus social {{interaction}} {{would have more}} closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process. Evidence of cannibalism in Daspletosaurus was published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the use {{of aspirin}} for {{prevention}} is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin.|$|E

Hostage III <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{fifth-generation}} jet fighters {{will operate}} {{together in a}} [...] "combat cloud" [...] along with future unmanned combat aircraft, and Manazir <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that this might come as quickly as loading a UCLASS with AMRAAMs to be launched at the command of an F-35.|$|R
5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that the {{fragment}} {{appears to have}} been intentionally cut, most likely in modern times. They further suggest that this leads to the possibility that in context Jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and {{received}} the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing {{for himself and his}} attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that they trust in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|A {{relationship}} between the Brachiopoda and Nemertea <b>has</b> been <b>suggested</b> by molecular data. A second study <b>has</b> also <b>suggested</b> this relationship. This latter study also suggested that Annelida and Mollusca may be sister clades. Another study <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that Annelida and Mollusca are sister clades. This clade has been termed the Neotrochozoa.|$|R

5|$|Lajoie {{finished}} the season tied for third-most in hits (168) while Cobb's batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and hit total led the American League. Baseball historians <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> the managerial duties Lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers.|$|E
5|$|More {{primitive}} relatives such as Noasaurus and Ceratosaurus had longer, mobile {{arms with}} fingers and claws. Paleobiologist Alexander O. Vargas <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{a major reason}} for the evolution towards vestigial forelimbs in the group was because of a genetic defect; the loss of function in HOXA11 and HOXD11, two genes which regulate the forelimbs' development.|$|E

5|$|Some analysts <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that foreign}} powers, {{including}} Russia, {{may have been}} behind the shooting.

5|$|Some older studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a {{subsequent}} meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes.

5|$|Some studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} clade Megaraptora, usually {{considered}} to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids. However, other authors disputed the placement of megaraptorans within Tyrannosauroidea, and a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at least partly reject their prior conclusion.|$|E
