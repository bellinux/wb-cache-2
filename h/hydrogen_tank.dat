5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after launch {{and during the}} ascent, flight systems reported problems with a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> transducer and a circuit breaker; the crew was immediately advised to disregard the resultant alarms and continue to orbit.|$|E
25|$|The weight {{reduction}} {{from the}} SWT {{was accomplished by}} eliminating portions of stringers (structural stiffeners running {{the length of the}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank),</b> using fewer stiffener rings and by modifying major frames in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank.</b> Also, significant portions of the tank were milled differently so as to reduce thickness, and the weight of the ET's aft solid rocket booster attachments was reduced by using a stronger, yet lighter and less expensive titanium alloy.|$|E
25|$|The ET {{has five}} {{propellant}} umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: {{two for the}} liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank.</b> One of the liquid oxygen tank umbilical valves is for liquid oxygen, the other for gaseous oxygen. The liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during prelaunch.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium alanate {{has been}} {{explored}} for hydrogen storage in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks.</b> The relevant reactions are: ...|$|R
25|$|BMW {{has been}} working on liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> for cars, {{producing}} for example the BMW Hydrogen 7.|$|R
50|$|The 700 Bar (10,153 PSI) <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> for <b>hydrogen</b> storage contain enough {{fuel for}} a 369 mi drive.|$|R
25|$|Compressed hydrogen, by comparison, {{is stored}} quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good energy density by weight, but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it {{requires}} a larger tank to store. A large <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store {{the same amount of}} energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank).</b> Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content to power the compressor. Higher compression without energy recovery will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low permeation.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} infrastructure would consist {{mainly of}} industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those {{found on a}} hydrogen highway. Hydrogen stations which were not situated near a hydrogen pipeline would get supply via hydrogen tanks, compressed hydrogen tube trailers, liquid hydrogen trailers, liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> trucks or dedicated onsite production.|$|E
25|$|Compressed {{hydrogen}} is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures {{to increase the}} storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology. Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda or Nissan.|$|E
25|$|Four {{pressure}} transducers {{located at the}} top of the liquid oxygen and liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> monitor the ullage pressures.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} {{transport}} is a hydrogen tanker that carries smaller highly insulated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> filled with liquid hydrogen.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle uses {{a series}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> {{connected}} to a fuel cell, that converts hydrogen into electricity which powers an electric drivetrain.|$|R
25|$|This {{procedure}} {{was designed to}} prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued. The Mission Operations Report Apollo 13 recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low-pressure reading on <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> 2, and so it did not trigger {{to call attention to}} the high oxygen pressure reading.|$|E
25|$|The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) (Delta 9250) {{is similar}} to the Medium+ (4,2), but has a 5-m–diameter payload fairing for larger {{payloads}} and a modified second stage with a 5-meter liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> and stretched liquid oxygen tank. Because of the extra weight of the larger payload fairing and second stage, the Medium+ (5,2) can launch 5,072kg to GTO.|$|E
25|$|Each {{propellant}} tank has a vent and relief valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by {{ground support equipment}} for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the ullage (empty space) pressure of the liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).|$|E
50|$|The gas is {{then sent}} {{to one of the}} 4 high {{pressure}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks,</b> constructed from an aluminium inner shell, and an outer Carbon Fibre shell.|$|R
25|$|At Toyota’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center, the Mirai {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive crash testing to evaluate a design specifically intended to address frontal, side and rear impacts and to provide excellent protection of vehicle occupants. A high level of collision safety has also been achieved to help protect the fuel cell stack and high-pressure tanks against body deformation. The high pressure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> have excellent <b>hydrogen</b> permeation prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The vehicle structure is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> during frontal, side or rear impacts.|$|R
50|$|ROMBUS (Reusable Orbital Module, Booster, and Utility Shuttle), another design from Philip Bono. This wasn't {{technically}} {{single stage}} since it dropped {{some of its}} initial <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks,</b> but it came very close.|$|R
25|$|An HFEV is an all-electric car {{featuring}} an open-source battery in {{the form}} of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> and the atmosphere. HFEVs may also comprise closed-cell batteries for the purpose of power storage from regenerative braking, but this does not change the source of the motivation. It implies the HFEV is an electric car with two types of batteries. Since HFEVs are purely electric, and do not contain any type of heat engine, they are not hybrids.|$|E
25|$|The RS-68 {{engine is}} mounted {{to the lower}} thrust {{structure}} of the vehicle by a four-legged (quadrapod) thrust frame, and enclosed in a protective composite conical thermal shield. Above the thrust structure is an aluminum isogrid (a grid pattern machined out of {{the inside of the}} tank to reduce weight) liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank,</b> followed by a composite cylinder called the centerbody, an aluminum isogrid liquid oxygen tank, and a forward skirt. Along the back of the CBC is a cable tunnel to hold electrical and signal lines, and a feedline to carry the liquid oxygen to the RS-68 from the tank. The CBC is of a constant, 5-meter (16.4ft) diameter.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of the hydrogen engine was integrated into the regular engine production at the Dingolfing plant. It differs from the conventional petrol engine essentially only {{in regards to the}} intake tract with additional injection valves for the hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored cryogenically at a temperature of minus 253 degrees Celsius in a double-walled steel tank behind the rear seat back. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> holds 140 liters and allows an additional range of 350 kilometers. In addition, the 750hL has a fuel cell with a power of 5 kilowatts at 42 volts. This is not used as a drive unit, but as an auxiliary power unit (APU) for power supply to the electrical system.|$|E
50|$|The 350 Bar (5000 PSI) <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> for <b>hydrogen</b> storage contain enough {{fuel for}} a 248 mi drive. Using 700 Bar (10000 PSI) tanks the range is {{extended}} 70% to 421 mi.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} {{of several}} commercial <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> {{has been studied}} during high pressure (70 - 84 MPa) hydrogen cycling. The temperature of the gas at different points inside the tank, the temperature at the bosses and the tank outer wall temperature have been measured under different filling and emptying conditions. From the experimental results, {{the effect of the}} filling rate (1. 5 - 4 g/s) and the influence of the liner material in the thermal behaviour of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tanks</b> have been evaluated. Bosses thermal response under the different cycling conditions has also been investigated. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|R

25|$|The {{upper stage}} of the Delta IV, or DCSS, {{is based on the}} Delta III upper stage, but with {{increased}} propellant capacity. The 4-meter (13.1ft) version uses lengthened propellant tanks, while the 5-meter version has a 5-meter diameter liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> and a further lengthened liquid oxygen tank. The second stage is powered by a RL10B2 engine, which features an extendable carbon-carbon nozzle to improve specific impulse. Depending on variant, two different interstages are used to mate the first and second stages. A tapering interstage which narrows down from 5 m to 4 m in diameter is used on 4-meter variants, where a cylindrical interstage is used on 5-meter variants. Both interstages are built from composites.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, higher {{volumetric}} {{energy density}} liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268K (–252.882°C or –423.188°F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> insulation fails.|$|E
500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage {{centrifugal}} pump {{driven by a}} two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June, {{engineers}} also commenced X-ray inspections {{to verify}} {{the performance of the}} radius block doublers that were installed {{over the top of the}} stringers. The stringers form the backbone of ET-138's central [...] "intertank" [...] compartment that separates the upper liquid oxygen tank from the larger liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>tank</b> below. The installation of the doublers on ET-138 was ordered after engineers found stringer cracks in the tank used for Discoverys STS-133 mission.
