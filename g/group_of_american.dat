5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E

5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the site}} of the Ein Husub police station during the British Mandate of Palestine, the {{location}} was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart from a small military base and roadside cafe on the way to Eilat. It was founded by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Jews led by former law student and court clerk Rabbi Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from Miami, Florida.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two).

5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s the museum {{acquired}} several important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress in 1980, and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford's {{association with the}} US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration {{of the role of}} American air power in the Second World War. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> supporters was formed, and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia, and £6.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{she began}} writing her autobiography, {{with the support}} of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> admirers, {{including}} journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, Living My Life, as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf, however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due {{in large part to the}} Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Saturday Review of Literature all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Nazis, led by Frank Collin, {{applied to}} the town of Skokie, Illinois for {{permission}} to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration. Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court. The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in Smith v. Collin, 447 F.Supp. 676.The federal appeal case was Smith v. Collin 447 F.Supp. 676. See also Supreme Court: Smith v. Collin, 439 U.S. 916 (1978), and National Socialist Party v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43 (1977).|$|E

5|$|On 1 June Governor King issued {{directions}} for Integritys second voyage. With Lieutenant Houstoun again in command, the cutter was to transport Lieutenant-Colonel William Paterson {{to the north}} of Van Diemen's Land in order to found a new settlement at Port Dalrymple. To support the settlement, the cutter was also assigned to carry nineteen soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, a ship's surgeon and ten convicts. A further fifteen soldiers and eleven convicts would accompany the expedition aboard a privately owned vessel, Contest. Once Paterson had disembarked at Port Dalrymple, Integrity was to follow the coastline of Port Phillip Bay so that Houstoun could survey the shore and determine its suitability for future colonisation. The cutter would then proceed to Cape Barren Island, a remote location in Bass Strait, to investigate rumours that a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> sailors were establishing an unlawful trade in seal skins.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid {{proved to be the}} tipping point in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers of American troops to the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E

5|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he was}} {{following}} his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; {{by the end of}} the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water.|$|E
