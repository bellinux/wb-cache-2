50|$|The aim of <b>Kegel</b> {{exercises}} is {{to improve}} muscle tone by strengthening the pubococcygeus muscles of the pelvic floor. <b>Kegel</b> is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the pelvic floor for physiological stresses of the later stages of pregnancy and childbirth. <b>Kegel</b> exercises {{are said to be}} good for treating vaginal prolapse and preventing uterine prolapse in women and for treating prostate pain and swelling resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis in men. <b>Kegel</b> exercises may be beneficial in treating urinary incontinence in both men and women. <b>Kegel</b> exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete pompoir and aid in reducing premature ejaculation in men. The many actions performed by <b>Kegel</b> muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the <b>Kegel</b> muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of correct pelvic floor exercise technique.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Kegel</b> perineometer or vaginal {{manometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles. Arnold <b>Kegel</b> (1894-1981) was the gynecologist who invented the <b>Kegel</b> Perineometer (used for measuring vaginal air pressure) and <b>Kegel</b> exercises (squeezing of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor). This followed the observation that muscles of the pelvic floor inevitably weakened following the trauma of childbirth. [...] Ascertaining the air pressure inside the vagina by insertion of a perineometer, while requesting the woman to squeeze as hard as possible, indicates whether or not she would benefit from strengthening the vaginal muscles using the <b>Kegel</b> exercises. More modern electromyograph (EMG) perineometers, which measure electrical activity in the pelvic floor muscles, may be more effective in this purpose. [...] Assessment of pelvic floor strength during gynaecological examination may help to identify women with fascial defects of the pelvic floor, as well as those at risk of genital prolapse or urinary incontinence. Both the <b>Kegel</b> perineometer and a digital examination are effective and concordant in their results in this assessment.|$|R

Additional topics of study were whether or not these athletes have ever received training in pelvic floor strengthening exercises and the impact of this issue on quality of life. Data was collected from 49 subjects via surveys including the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire and one created by investigators. Among 49 athletes, 27 young women (55. 1 %) reported urinary leakage. The mean age was 15. 6 (± 1. 3) years of the total participants and 15. 6 (± 1. 1) years for those that reported leakage.

Research {{completed}} at Department of Physical Therapy, College of Health ProfessionsPurpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) in middle school and high school-aged female athletes in order to implement preventative education in the future, as well as to determine the association between prevalence and quality of life. This study also investigates whether or not the young athletes that do experience UI have ever received formal training in pelvic floor exercises that have been previously proven as effective in the treatment of UI. Methods: The study includes 49 middle school and high school aged female athletes. Permission was granted from the parent/guardian(s) through consent forms as well as from the subjects themselves through assent forms. Once consent and assent were granted, a second meeting with the team was scheduled to administer the survey, which consisted of the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire as well as one created by the investigators titled "Female Urinary Incontinence Survey. " Furthermore, prevalence of urinary incontinence and the effect it has on quality of life was investigated. Results: Among the 49 participants, 27 young women (55. 1 %) reported urinary leakage. The mean age was 15. 6 (+/- 1. 3) years of the total participants and 15. 6 (+/- 1. 1) years for those that reported leakage. Of the 49 participants, 26 played volleyball with 16 out of 26 (61. 5 %) reporting leakage; 25 played basketball with 14 out of 25 (53. 8 %) reporting leakage; 12 played softball with 5 out of 12 (19. 2 %) reporting leakage; 7 played track field events with 5 out of 7 (19. 2 %) reporting leakage; 4 running track with 2 out of 4 (7. 7 %) reporting leakage; and 9 participate in other sports including swimming, rodeo, cheer, and soccer with 4 out of 9 (15. 4 %) reporting leakage. Out of those reporting leakage (27), 17 (63. 0 %) reported feeling embarrassed, 4 (14. 8 %) reported feeling afraid, and 5 (18. 5 %) reported feeling bad about themselves. Among the young athletes that reported UI, 55. 6 % reported no previous education on the performance of pelvic floor exercises (<b>Kegels)</b> in order to prevent the occurrence of UI. Conclusions: The study found that there is a prevalence of urinary incontinence in middle school and high school aged female athletes. This in turn has a negative effect on the quality of life of these young female athletes causing them to feel embarrassed, afraid, and bad about themselves. Because the study showed that urinary incontinence is occurring at such a young age and that many of these young athletes have never been educated in <b>Kegels,</b> a preventative education program is now being developed in order to enhance the quality of life of these young female athletes.

Methods: This is a planned secondary analysis of responses from 2, 812 black and white community-dwelling women living in southeastern Michigan, aged 35 – 64 years, who completed a telephone interview concerning UI, healthcare-seeking behaviors and management strategies. The study population was 571 subjects (278 black, 293 white) who self-identified as having urinary incontinence. Results: Of these women with UI, 51 % sought healthcare with {{no statistically significant difference}} between the two races (53 % black, 50. 6 % white, P 0. 64). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, a higher likelihood of seeking healthcare was associated with increased age, body mass index lower than 30 kg/m 2, prior surgery for UI, having regular pelvic exams, having a doctor, and worsening severity of UI. There was no significant association between hypothesized barriers to care seek-ing and race. Almost 95 % of the subjects identified lack of knowledge of available treatments as one barrier. Black and white women were similar in percentage use of medications and some self-care strategies, for example, pad wearing and bathroom mapping, but black women {{were significantly more likely to}} restrict fluid intake than white women and marginally less likely to perform <b>Kegels.</b> Conclusions: Black and white women seek healthcare for UI at similar, low rates.
