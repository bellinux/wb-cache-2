5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or <b>heartburn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. <b>Heartburn</b> or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, <b>heartburn,</b> odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence {{is as high as}} 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E
5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes <b>heartburn</b> and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like <b>heartburn.</b> Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{are unable}} to predict who with <b>heartburn</b> will develop Barrett's esophagus. While no {{relationship}} exists between the severity of <b>heartburn</b> {{and the development of}} Barrett's esophagus, a relationship does exist between chronic <b>heartburn</b> and the development of Barrett's esophagus. Sometimes, people with Barrett's esophagus have no <b>heartburn</b> symptoms at all. In rare cases, damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a corrosive substance such as lye.|$|E
25|$|Regurgitation, <b>heartburn,</b> and nausea.|$|E
25|$|GERD {{may lead}} to Barrett's esophagus, a type of {{intestinal}} metaplasia, which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer. The risk of progression from Barrett's to dysplasia is uncertain, but is estimated at about 20% of cases. Due {{to the risk of}} chronic <b>heartburn</b> progressing to Barrett's, EGD every five years is recommended for people with chronic <b>heartburn,</b> or who take drugs for chronic GERD.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine is used {{to inhibit}} stomach acid {{production}} and {{is used in the}} treatment of <b>heartburn</b> and peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reactions}} {{that have been}} reported with isosorbide mononitrate modified-release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo, and <b>heartburn.</b>|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{infrequent}} <b>heartburn</b> may take either antacids or H2-receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2-antagonists offer several advantages over antacids, including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for antacids), greater efficacy, and ability to be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of <b>heartburn</b> occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for erosive esophagitis since they {{have been shown to}} promote healing better than H2-antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Tagamet has {{now been}} largely {{replaced}} by the proton pump inhibitors for treating peptic ulcers, but is now available as an over-the-counter medicine for <b>heartburn</b> in many countries.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the pancreas problems, people with cystic fibrosis experience more <b>heartburn,</b> intestinal blockage by intussusception, and constipation. Older individuals with CF may develop distal intestinal obstruction syndrome when thickened feces cause intestinal blockage.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tagamet among others, is a {{histamine}} H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is available over-the-counter and is mainly used {{in the treatment of}} <b>heartburn</b> and peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Don't Be Satisfied With Symptomatic Relief! It's Possible to RELIEVE THE CAUSE OF YOUR AILMENTS When Lack Of Vitamins B1, B2, Iron and Niacin Cause Stomach Disturbances, Gas, <b>Heartburn,</b> Indigestion, Nagging Aches and Pains, and Certain Nervous Disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of GERD in adults are an acidic taste in the mouth, regurgitation, and <b>heartburn.</b> Less common symptoms include pain with swallowing/sore throat, increased salivation (also known as water brash), nausea, chest pain, and coughing.|$|E
25|$|A {{history of}} <b>heartburn,</b> {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) {{and use of}} certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and prednisolone).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects during {{treatment}} with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, <b>heartburn,</b> nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and paleness.flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are mycardial infarction and hypersensitivy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}}, {{such as the}} penicillum {{can cause}} diarrhea. Over 700 medications are known to cause diarrhea. The classes of medications that are known to cause diarrhea are laxatives, antacids, <b>heartburn</b> medications, antibiotics, anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-inflammatories {{as well as many}} dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{side effects}} of 5-HTP include <b>heartburn,</b> stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, vivid dreams or nightmares, and muscle problems. Because 5-HTP has not been {{thoroughly}} studied in a clinical setting, possible side effects and interactions with other drugs are not well known.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate may be {{a factor}} for <b>heartburn</b> in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the {{oesophageal}} sphincter muscle, hence permitting stomach acidic contents {{to enter into the}} oesophagus. Theobromine is also toxic to some animals unable to metabolize it (see theobromine poisoning).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, P was {{sued for}} its ads falsely {{suggesting}} to the consumers {{that the drug}} Prilosec could cure <b>heartburn</b> in a day. In December 2005, the Pharmaceutical division of P {{was involved in a}} dispute over research involving its osteoporosis drug Actonel. The case was discussed in the media.|$|E
25|$|The most typical {{symptoms}} {{of ovarian cancer}} include bloating, abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort, back pain, irregular menstruation or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, pain or bleeding after or during sexual intercourse, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, indigestion, <b>heartburn,</b> constipation, nausea, feeling full, and possibly urinary symptoms (including frequent urination and urgent urination).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and <b>heartburn.</b> More severe side effects include {{bleeding}} and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While {{there is no}} evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has been poorly studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelet agent. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12, on platelets.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a {{condition}} in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as <b>heartburn.</b> Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus minimizing their effect on the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), {{also known}} as acid reflux, is a {{long-term}} condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Symptoms include the taste of acid {{in the back of}} the mouth, <b>heartburn,</b> bad breath, chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparing}} tissues for histology or histopathology, d-limonene {{is often}} used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. In traditional medicine, d-limonene is marketed to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease and <b>heartburn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{headaches}} and <b>heartburn,</b> {{as well as}} flushed skin. Caution is advised in those who have cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include prolonged erections, {{which can lead to}} damage to the penis, and sudden-onset hearing loss. Sildenafil should not be taken by people who take nitrates such as nitroglycerin (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, <b>heartburn</b> and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E
25|$|A hiatus hernia {{is a type}} of hernia {{in which}} {{abdominal}} organs (typically the stomach) slip through the diaphragm into the middle compartment of the chest. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with symptoms such as a taste of acid {{in the back of the}} mouth or <b>heartburn.</b> Other symptoms may include trouble swallowing and chest pains. Complications may include iron deficiency anemia, volvulus, or bowel obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Stomach cancer, {{also known}} as gastric cancer, is cancer {{developing}} from {{the lining of the}} stomach. Early symptoms may include <b>heartburn,</b> upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach {{to other parts of the}} body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|A risk {{of ovarian}} {{stimulation}} {{is the development}} of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing final oocyte maturation. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of <b>heartburn,</b> gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} a malformation of the digestive system, characterized by a severe impairment {{in the ability of}} the intestines to push and assimilate. Symptoms include daily abdominal and stomach pain, nausea, severe distension, vomiting, <b>heartburn,</b> dysphagia, diarrhea, constipation, dehydration and malnutrition. There is no cure for intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and treatment managing life-threatening complications such as ileus and volvulus, intestinal stasis which lead to bacterial overgrowth, and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut may be needed. Many patients require parenteral nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD), {{also known as}} ischemic heart disease (IHD), {{is a group of}} {{diseases}} that includes: stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases of which it is the most common type. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like <b>heartburn.</b> Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and get better with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. Occasionally, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.|$|E

She won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2004 {{for her role in}} Jack. Her film {{appearances}} include The Fortune (1975), The Big Bus (1976), The Cheap Detective (1978), <b>Heartburn</b> (1986), Up Close & Personal (1996), Practical Magic (1998), and Woody Allen's Anything Else (2003). She also played the recurring role of Veronica Loy on the CBS drama The Good Wife (2012–16).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{gastrointestinal}} complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, <b>heartburn,</b> difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; {{the most common}} symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.|$|E
