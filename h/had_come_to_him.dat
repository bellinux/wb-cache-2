He disclaimed responsibility for the Williams Station incident, which he blamed on a group of Bannocks over whom he had no authority.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Boys in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture {{entitled}} Anniyan. It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project Robot revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his [...] "dream project" [...] and disclosed {{that it would be}} a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long before I started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with me. Those were the seeds. I make films based on them." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1966, Barrett Strong, {{the singer}} on Motown Records' {{breakthrough}} hit, [...] "Money (That's What I Want)", had {{the basics of}} a song he had started to write in Chicago, where the idea <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while walking down Michigan Avenue that people were always saying [...] "I heard it through the grapevine". The phrase is associated with black slaves during the Civil War, who had their form of telegraph: the human grapevine. Producer Norman Whitfield worked with Strong on the song, adding lyrics to Strong's basic Ray Charles influenced gospel tune and the single chorus line of [...] "I heard it through the grapevine". This {{was to be the}} first of a number of successful collaborations between Strong and Whitfield.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he was in}} {{many ways}} {{spiraling}} out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of [...] "Ring of Fire" [...] was a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash. He said that it <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of [...] "Ring of Fire." [...] In her book, I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny, Liberto says that Cash gave Carter the credit for monetary reasons.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Forbes {{estimated}} Rockefeller's net worth was $3.3 billion. Initially, most of his wealth <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> via the family trusts that his father had set up, which were administered by Room 5600 and the Chase Bank. In turn, most of these trusts were held as shares in the successor companies of Standard Oil, as well as diverse real estate investment partnerships, such as the expansive Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, which he later sold for considerable profit, retaining only an indirect stake. In addition, he was or had been a partner in various properties such as [...] Caneel Bay, a [...] resort development in the Virgin Islands and a cattle ranch in Argentina, as well as a [...] sheep ranch in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Cayce {{was quite}} unconvinced {{that he had}} been {{referring}} to the doctrine of reincarnation, and the best Lammers could offer was that the reading [...] "opens up the door" [...] and to go on to share his beliefs and knowledge with Cayce. Lammers <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with quite a bit of information of his own to share with Cayce and seemed intent upon convincing Cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs. It should be noted, however, that 12 years earlier Cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation. In reading 4841-1, given April 22, 1911, Cayce referred to the soul being [...] "transmigrated." [...] Because Cayce's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923, it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings.|$|E

According to the , Prince tried to block Pelton's ownership and copyright by suing Pelton in Federal court, [...] but then [...] that the Federal court in Virginia under presiding Judge Leonie Brinkema dismiss Prince's own case before it was brought to a jury trial. Pelton then sued Prince in Loudon County with a court case scheduled for December 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Fearing {{that the}} war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough {{favorable}} reports <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from this warm region below {{the rim of the}} Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here. At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October 6th, 1861, about three hundred families were [...] "called" [...] to the Dixie mission to promote the cotton industry. [...] Most of the people knew nothing of this expedition until their names were read from the pulpit; but in nearly every case, they responded with good will, and made ready to leave within the month’s time allotted to them. The families were selected so as to ensure the communities the right number of farmers, masons, blacksmiths, businessmen, educators, carpenters, as needed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, Edward {{died of a}} stroke, leaving William {{to manage}} the firm alone. He {{continued}} to publish new authors, with, most notably, the first books of Thomas Hardy and G. A. Henty and the first novels of Richard Jefferies. In both Hardy's and Jefferies' case, he let the authors take {{a part of the}} risk, asking the former for £75, the latter for £60 to guarantee the costs. [...] Hardy had brought Desperate Remedies (1871) to Tinsley because of the firm's reputation as a publisher of sensational novels; but the book (like Jefferies' early novels) was not a success and Hardy regained only £59, 12s., 6d. from his original £75. [...] Despite this experience, Hardy returned to Tinsley with Under the Greenwood Tree (1872). Tinsley bought the copyright for £30, but again was unable to sell it. A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873) was yet another commercial failure; and later books by Hardy came out (more successfully) with other publishers. In old age, Tinsley recounted that he never had the offer of Far from the Madding Crowd (1874); but his assistant Edmund Downey remembered Tinsley telling him that Hardy <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> detailing the rival offer: ...|$|E

2500|$|Janet Arvizo first {{approached}} attorney Bill Dickerman {{to discuss}} taking {{legal action against}} Martin Bashir. Dickerman referred her to Larry Feldman, the attorney who represented Jordan Chandler , the first accuser, in 1993. Feldman then contacted child psychologist Stan Katz, who told Santa Barbara sheriff's investigator Paul Zelis that [...] "Mr. Feldman actually referred these kids to me. Because they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in this lawsuit." [...] It was then that allegations of child molestation surfaced, and Katz reported this to the authorities, as is compulsory for someone in his profession in such cases. He said in a taped conversation that he didn't consider Jackson a pedophile but a [...] "regressed 10-year-old." [...] Larry Feldman was the attorney who helped Jordan Chandler win an out-of-court settlement reportedly for $20million, and Dr. Katz was the psychologist that assisted Evan Chandler in uncovering whether his son was suffering abuse. The defense later focused on Feldman and Katz, stressing that Janet {{went to the same}} people who helped obtain a settlement from Jackson in 1993 prior to ever going to the police. The circumstances by which the Arvizos' allegations surfaced aroused suspicion over their claims and caused some to believe that the family was merely seeking money. Others believed that Janet sought legal advice perhaps because she was afraid that she could be charged with child endangerment for allowing her sons to sleep in Jackson's bed.|$|E
