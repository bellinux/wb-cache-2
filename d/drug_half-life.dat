Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and <b>drug</b> <b>half-life</b> plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E
50|$|Nitrendipine {{is given}} to {{hypertensive}} individuals in 20 mg oral tablets every day. This amount is effective in reducing blood pressure by 15-20% within 1-2 hours of administration. With long-term treatments, the dosage may rise {{to as much as}} 40 mg/day; in elderly individuals, a lower dosage of up to 5 mg/day may be equally effective (this reduction in drug amount is attributed to decreased liver function or “first pass” metabolism). Once digested, nitrendipine is absorbed into the blood and binds to plasma proteins. The majority (98%) is bound to plasma proteins and 70-80% of its inactive polar metabolites are also bound to plasma proteins. Following hepatic metabolism, 80% of the 20 mg dose can be recovered in the first 96 hours as inactive polar metabolites. The specific volume of distribution of the drug is 2-6 L/kg. In terms of <b>drug</b> <b>half-life,</b> nitrendipine has a half-life of 12-24 hours. The reported side effects include: headache, flushing, edema and palpitations. These side effects can all be attributed to thevasodilation effect of this drug.|$|E

The {{dependence}} {{potential of}} benzodiazepine medications is now widely recognized, but uncertainty exists {{as to whether}} use of short half-life vs long <b>half-life</b> <b>drugs</b> results in greater dependence. The present study reports a meta-analysis of the extant research to evaluate the dependence potential {{of different types of}} benzodiazepines. METHOD. Seven studies were found that specifically compared long half-life and short half-life benzodiazepines and allowed statistical comparison by their homogeneous dependent variables. Drugs in these studies were used as daytime sedatives. RESULTS. Substantial evidence was found for differential effects of short vs long <b>half-life</b> <b>drugs</b> at withdrawal. In all studies, dropouts were higher among short half-life subjects.

40|$|Current anti-VEGF {{drugs for}} {{patients}} with diabetic retinopathy suffer from short residence time in the vitreous of the eye. In order to maintain biologically effective doses of drug for inhibiting retinal neovascularization, patients are required to receive regular monthly injections of drug, which often results in low patient compliance and progression of the disease. To improve the intravitreal residence time of anti-VEGF drugs, we have synthesized multivalent bioconjugates of an anti-VEGF protein, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 (sFlt) that is covalently grafted to chains of hyaluronic acid (HyA), conjugates that are termed mvsFlt. Using a mouse corneal angiogenesis assay, we demonstrate that covalent conjugation to HyA chains does not decrease the bioactivity of sFlt and that mvsFlt is equivalent to sFlt at inhibiting corneal angiogenesis. In a rat vitreous model, we observed that mvsFlt had significantly increased intravitreal residence time compared to the unconjugated sFlt after 2 days. The calculated intravitreal half-lives for sFlt and mvsFlt were 3. 3 and 35 hours, respectively. Furthermore, we show that mvsFlt {{is more effective than}} the unconjugated form at inhibiting retinal neovascularization in an oxygen-induced retinopathy model, an effect that is most likely due to the longer half-life of mvsFlt in the vitreous. Taken together, our results indicate that conjugation of sFlt to HyA does not affect its affinity for VEGF and this conjugation significantly improves <b>drug</b> <b>half-life.</b> These in vivo results suggest that our strategy of multivalent conjugation could substantially improve upon <b>drug</b> <b>half-life,</b> and thus the efficacy of currently available drugs that are used in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, thereby improving patient quality of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of aminoglycoside elimination {{were determined}} in 18 hospitalized narcotics abusers receiving gentamicin or tobramycin {{for treatment of}} severe infection. Rapid aminoglycoside elimination (requiring doses of greater than 5 mg/kg per day to maintain adequate drug levels) was noted in 12 of the 18 patients (18 of 27 clearance studies). Patients found to have rapid elimination were younger (P less than 0. 01) and had larger drug distribution volumes (P less than 0. 005), greater measured creatinine clearances (P less than 0. 05), and lower creatinine levels in serum (P less than 0. 001) than those with normal elimination. Nevertheless, by regression analysis, age, creatinine levels in serum, creatinine clearances, and drug distribution volumes proved to be unreliable predictors of individual aminoglycoside clearance. Measured <b>drug</b> <b>half-life</b> in serum {{appeared to be the}} only reliable predictor of drug clearance (r = 0. 93). Patients with rapid drug elimination had aminoglycoside clearances 16 to 43 % greater than measured creatinine clearances, suggesting an extraglomerular route of drug elimination. We conclude that in drug abuse patients a significant and clinically unpredictable interpatient variation occurs in aminoglycoside elimination and that accurate serum kinetics are needed to determine therapeutic dosing. In addicts younger than 35 years, with a creatinine level of less than 1. 0 mg/ 100 ml in serum, the risk of inadequate therapy is high if standard dosing guidelines are followed. For this group, initial dosing of 8 mg/kg per day, with a <b>drug</b> <b>half-life</b> determination on the first dose, is recommended.

FA receptor-targeted poloxamer 407 nanocrystals, containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), significantly increased drug bioavailability and PD by five and 100 times, respectively. Drug particles administered to human {{peripheral blood lymphocyte}} reconstituted NOD.

Drug levels were higher in these tissues than what could be achieved by either native drug or untargeted nanoART particles. The data also mirrored potent reductions in viral loads, tissue viral RNA and numbers of HIV- 1 p 24 + cells in infected and treated animals.

The two most common physicochemical entities that can cause adverse drug interactions are dilution-dependent reactions and acid-base reactions. Adverse reactions when they occur become evident by physical changes like precipitates, effervescence, haziness and viscosity changes. Precipitates are avoided by injecting the drugs through different syringes. Still, the development of subclinical microprecipitates cannot be ruled out.
