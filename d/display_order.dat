50|$|Early {{computer}} installations {{were designed}} only {{to support a}} single writing system, typically for left-to-right scripts based on the Latin alphabet only. Adding new character sets and character encodings enabled {{a number of other}} left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as Arabic or Hebrew, and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like ISO/IEC 8859-6 and ISO/IEC 8859-8, storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right <b>display</b> <b>order</b> to a right-to-left <b>display</b> <b>order,</b> but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.|$|E

In older designs such as MPEG-1 and H.262/MPEG-2, each B picture can only reference two pictures, {{the one which}} precedes the B picture in <b>display</b> <b>order</b> and the one which follows, and all referenced pictures must be I or P pictures.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the network, the second fundamental challenge at the time SIMNET was conceived was the inability of graphics systems to handle large numbers of moving models. For example, most contemporary flight simulators used Binary Space Partitioning which is computationally effective for fixed environments since polygon <b>display</b> <b>order</b> (i.e., their depth coherence) can be pre-computed. While suitable for flight simulators, which largely have {{a point of view}} above the Earth's fixed surface, this technique is ineffective near the ground, where the order in which polygons overlay each other changes with the location of the point of view. It is also ineffective with a large number of moving models, since moving a model changes its depth coherence relative to the polygons representing the ground.|$|E
40|$|Dark pools are equity trading {{systems that}} do not {{publicly}} <b>display</b> <b>orders.</b> Dark pools offer potential price improvements but do not guarantee execution. Informed traders tend to trade in the same direction, crowd on the heavy side of the market, and face a higher execution risk in the dark pool, relative to uninformed traders. Consequently, exchanges are more attractive to informed traders, and dark pools are more attractive to uninformed traders. Under certain conditions, adding a dark pool alongside an exchange concentrates price-relevant information into the exchange and improves price discovery. Improved price discovery coincides with reduced exchange liquidity. (JEL G 12, G 14, G 18) Dark pools are equity trading systems {{that do not}} publicly <b>display</b> <b>orders.</b> Some dark pools passively match buyers and sellers at exchange prices, such as {{the midpoint of the}} exchange bid and offer. Other dark pools execute orders by their price and time priority. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC 2010), as of September 2009, thirty-two dark pools in the United States accounted for 7. 9 % of total equity trading volume. As of mid- 2011, industry estimates from the Tabb Group, a consultancy, and Rosenblatt Securities,...|$|R

This differs from a trading facility with execution capabilities (stock exchange) in that the exchange would simply send back to the owner of the <b>displayed</b> <b>order</b> a notice of execution. FINRA has operated an ADF since July 29, 2002.|$|R

50|$|In {{the newer}} designs found in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC, {{encoders}} {{have much more}} flexibility about referencing structures. They can use the same referencing structures as were previously used in older designs, or they can use more pictures as references and they can use more flexible ordering of the coding order relative to the <b>display</b> <b>order.</b> They are also allowed to use B pictures as references when coding other (B or P) pictures. This extra flexibility can improve compression efficiency, but it can cause propagation of errors if some data becomes lost or corrupted. One popular structure for use with the newer designs {{is the use of}} a hierarchy of B pictures. Hierarchical B pictures can provide very good compression efficiency and can also limit the propagation of errors, since the hierarchy can ensure that the number of pictures affected by any data corruption problem is strictly limited.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} involving 123 {{university students}} tested directionality {{effects in the}} comprehension of spatial relations, quantified statements, and propositional connectives with a sentence-picture verification task. Presentation of the referents of terms in the statements was separated by 1 s, and presentation order was congruent or incongruent with the order of terms in the statement. Some relations showed faster verification times for congruent <b>display</b> <b>order,</b> others for incongruent <b>display</b> <b>order,</b> and still others showed no directionality effect. The authors proposed a 2 -step process model {{for the construction of}} semantic representations of relational statements, in which a reference object is established f'trst, and then the second object is attached in relation to it. This theory explains the various directionality effects as a general preference to process information about the reference object before information about the target object. One of the central questions in research on deductive reasoning is, How do people understand the premises? In other words, what is the content and the form of the knowledge base that people extract from the information given and to which they apply whatever reasoning process they have available to draw a deductiv...|$|E

The resulting nonequilibrium ordered phase displays robust giant number fluctuations that cannot be suppressed even by an incompressible solvent.
