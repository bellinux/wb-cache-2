5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out.

The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
