40|$|We {{develop a}} multi-objective {{model for the}} time–cost {{trade-off}} problem in a dynamic PERT network using an interactive approach. The activity durations are exponentially distributed random variables and the new projects are generated according to a renewal process and share the same facilities. Thus, these projects cannot be analyzed independently. This dynamic PERT network is represented as a network of queues, where the service times represent the durations of the corresponding activities and the arrival stream to each node follows a renewal process. At the first stage, we transform the dynamic PERT network into a proper stochastic network and then compute the project completion time distribution by constructing a continuous-time Markov chain. At the second stage, the time–cost trade-off problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimal control problem that involves four conflicting objective functions. Then, the STEM method is used to solve a discrete-time approximation of the original problem.

Materials and methods Seventy-five consecutive men attending sleep centre at the Queen Mary Hospital without history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or hyperlipidemia were recruited. All patients underwent abdominal MR examination using a 1. 5 T magnet within 10 days of polysomnogram and metabolic studies. Axial spin echo (SE) scans (TR 350 ms, TE 12 ms, slice thickness 10 mm) were obtained from inferior endplate of L 4 to inferior endplate of S 1. Digital data was transferred to a computer and axial image {{through the middle of}} the umbilicus was selected. Threshold values were used (analyze 5. 0) to segment out intraabdominal (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) area. Total abdominal fat (TAF) area was obtained by summation of the intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat areas. Cardiovascular risk parameters were obtained in each patient: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP); fasting serum cholesterol, triglicerides, glucose, high density lipid (HDL), low density lipid (LDL); insulin sensitivity (HOMA); and apnoea-hypopnoea index, arousal index, <b>duration</b> of <b>O</b> 2 saturation < 90 % and minimum O 2 saturation. Fat parameters were correlated with cardiovascular risk parameters, age adjusted. Linear regression analysis was performed for all parameters to determine which fat parameter was best predictive for each of the cardiovascular risk parameters. Results SCF area was correlated with HOMA (r = 0. 44, p < 0. 001), cholesterol/HDL (r = 0. 28, p = 0. 017), apnoea-hypopnoea index (r = 0. 34, p = 0. 003), <b>duration</b> of <b>O</b> 2 saturation < 90 % (r = 0. 37, p = 0. 001), and minimum O 2 saturation (r = - 0. 24, p = 0. 038).

DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies were identified by systematically searching the PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases through November 2012 without language restriction. STUDY SELECTION: We identified 12 cross-sectional studies with 76 027 participants including 14 404 cases of metabolic syndrome, and 3 cohort studies with 2055 participants and 283 incident cases of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: For short sleep <b>durations</b> (<b>o</b> 5 to 6 h), the odds ratios (OR) was 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 10 – 1. 48, I 2 75. 5 %) in the 12 cross-sectional studies and 1. 62 (95 % CI 0. 74 – 3. 55, I 2 71. 4 %) in the 3 cohort studies; for long sleep durations (48 to 10 h), the OR was 1. 23 (95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 49, I 2 75. 8 %) in the 11 cross-sectional studies and 1. 62 (95 % CI 0. 86 – 3. 04, I 2 0. 0 %) in the 2 cohort studies.

40|$|The role of {{myeloperoxidase}} in {{the regulation}} of the respiratory burst of human neutrophils activated by the chemotactic peptide (N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine) plus cytochalasin B was determined by using anti-(human myeloperoxidase) antibody. The respiratory burst activated under these conditions consisted of an initial (1 - 2 min) phase with high rates of O 2 uptake, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence and superoxide radical (O 2 -.) generation and a second, more sustained, phase of lower magnitude of chemiluminescence and O 2 uptake: O 2 -. generation did not occur during this second phase. In cell suspensions stimulated {{in the presence of}} anti-(human myeloperoxidase) antibody, the magnitude of the initial phase of both O 2 uptake and O 2 -. generation was unaffected, but these high rates were maintained over much longer periods than in control suspensions.

Macrolides may be beneficial in settings where children have high rates of nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage and frequent prolonged illness. The aim of our double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial was to determine if a large single dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS), <b>duration</b> of oxygen (<b>O</b> 2) and respiratory readmissions within 6 months of children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. We also determined the effect of azithromycin on nasopharyngeal microbiology. MethodsChildren aged ≤ 18 months were randomised to receive a single large dose (30 mg/kg) of either azithromycin or placebo within 24 hrs of hospitalisation. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 48 hrs later. Primary endpoints (LOS, O 2) were monitored every 12 hrs. Hospitalised respiratory readmissions 6 -months post discharge was collected. Results 97 children were randomised (n = 50 azithromycin, n = 47 placebo). Median LOS was similar in both groups; azithromycin = 54 hours, placebo = 58 hours (difference between groups of 4 hours 95 %CI - 8, 13, p = 0. 6). O 2 requirement was not significantly different between groups; Azithromycin = 35 hrs; placebo = 42 hrs (difference 7 hours, 95 %CI - 9, 13, p = 0. 7).
