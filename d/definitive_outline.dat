50|$|In 1970, a {{group of}} {{experienced}} Sea Scout leaders met at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California. Their goal was {{to come up with}} an advanced management training experience for Sea Scout leaders. A curriculum was devised and the first Seabadge conference was held later that year at the U.S. Coast Guard training facility on Governor's Island, Alameda, California. A subsequent conference was held at U.S. Coast Guard Station, Los Angeles, California, and then spread all over the United States. The national committee on Sea Scouting saw the merit in this program and appointed a special subcommittee to gather the best practices of the courses that had been held. The result was the creation of the Seabadge Conference Guide, which is the <b>definitive</b> <b>outline</b> for delivering the Seabadge conference. Since 1970, the course has been revised several times, with the current course revised in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Yet Jackson {{would not}} be the only {{president}} to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a <b>definitive</b> narrative <b>outlining</b> its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: [...] "A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase [...] "Manifest Destiny".

40|$|An {{extensive}} survey {{aimed at}} updating {{and increasing the}} knowledge on species richness and distribution of Cladocera (Branchiopoda) in Sicily {{has been carried out}} in the period 2000 - 2004. More than 250 water bodies, mainly temporary, have been sampled on the whole Sicilian territory and the circum-Sicilian islands. This sampling effort led to the discovery of several species new to the fauna of the island and, coupled with a careful bibliographic review, allowed the realization of an updated checklist that includes 57 species definitely present on the island (only 33 were formerly known), and two more, whose actual presence in Sicily is dubious and needs confirmation. The chorological spectrum of the Sicilian cladoceran fauna shows a predominance of taxa with a wide distribution, but several others with a strictly Mediterranean range are also present. A slightly major affinity of the Sicilian cladoceran fauna with the Tunisian one, rather than with that inhabiting the water bodies of the Italian mainland, was observed. Moreover, the lack of detailed information on cladoceran species richness and composition in Tunisia does not allow to determine a <b>definitive</b> <b>outline</b> of the affinities and origins of the fauna on the island. Nevertheless, the island, located {{in the middle of the}} Mediterranean basin, represents a pivotal point in this area, characterized by high biodiversity indices...|$|E

40|$|Lactose in dairy {{products}} is maldigested {{by up to}} 70 % to 75 % of the world's population and many people may therefore suffer symptoms reminiscent of irritable bowel syndrome. As a result, most research to date has concentrated on ways of improving lactose tolerance to enhance dairy {{as a source of}} nutrition. However, research on other possible benefits of lactose and its maldigestion has lagged. In view of an exponential growth in the understanding of intestinal microfloral host interactions and the expanding therapeutical potential of probiotics, a reassessment of the role of lactose as a potential prebiotic in lactase nonpersistent subjects is required.

40|$|Background Breast carcinomas {{composed}} predominantly or exclusively {{of cells}} with foamy and/or granular cytoplasm have been termed histiocytoid breast carcinoma (HBC). Cases Three cases of HBC had fine needle aspirates that were moderately cellular and composed of cells with abundant foamy and/or granular cytoplasm, arranged in loosely cohesive groups and dispersed singly. The cells showed subtle cytologic atypia, including nuclear hyperchromasia and slightly irregular nuclear <b>outlines.</b> <b>Definitive</b> cytologic diagnosis {{was not possible}} in the 3 cases, and they were reported as 9 ̆ 3 suspicious for malignancy. 9 ̆ 4 Core biopsies of 2 cases showed a typical Indian file pattern of invasive lobular carcinoma, while the third case was composed of sheets of discohesive histiocytoid cells admixed with a prominent lymphoid infiltrate. All 3 cases were E-cadherin negative, confirming their lobular nature. Conclusion HBC represents an unusual morphologic pattern of apocrine change that {{may be seen in}} lobular and ductal breast carcinomas. Recognition of these lesions is vital in that they may be mistaken for a variety of other entities composed of foamy/granular cells; some of those entities have vastly different implications for treatment and prognosis...|$|R
50|$|While the {{increasing}} trend of exhausted land use {{has been shown}} to cause various environmental problems, physical human health issues can result as well. Research has shown that {{many parts of the world}} affected by land degradation and human interference are experiencing much higher rates of infectious disease. As land degradation increases across the globe, the status of human health is affected by the changing ecological systems that play host to various pathogens. Furthermore, human susceptibility toward infections often increases alongside changes to the environment. By incorporating sustainable living practices into daily life, many forerunners of biological disease can be avoided, thus preventing instances of epidemics or premature death. Current research has not been able to <b>outline</b> <b>definitive</b> cause and effect relationships between land degradation and the microbiology of pathogens, but well known examples of associations between the two are widely known. These include the contraction of tetanus from spores found in soil and water-related diseases caused by agricultural runoff contaminants. Further experimentation and observations must be conducted in Tanzania to establish concrete evidence for this theory. However, it is reasonable to predict some type of connection between the country’s widespread land degradation and an increased predilection for disease.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} the cytologic findings in simple trichilemmal (pilar) cysts and proliferating trichilemmal cysts (pilar tumors) and the clinical {{importance of these}} lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates from 12 simple pilar cysts and three pilar tumors, all histologically confirmed, were analyzed {{with a view to}} elaborating on specific cytologic features enabling a distinction from epidermal cysts and other adnexal tumors. RESULTS: Aspirates from pilar cysts showed two different pictures, depending on the age of the cyst. Young pilar cysts showed aspirates with an abundant background of blotchy keratin with or without calcification and inflammation. Older (degenerating) cysts showed oily fluid debris with cholesterol crystals and inflammatory cells. The epithelial component was sparse, and only an occasional syncitial cluster of small squamoid cells was seen. As opposed to this, epidermal cysts usually showed a cleaner background, with very cellular aspirates containing many nucleate and anucleate squames, keratin flakes, platelike crystals and no calcification. The pilar tumors showed a lesser amount of keratin as compared to pilar cysts and yielded large and small clusters of squamoid and basaloid cells, a few of which showed an abrupt association with anucleate, keratinized globules. CONCLUSION: The cytologic diagnosis of a pilar cyst should be made especially in scalp cysts, which yield either abundant, blotchy keratin or oily, cholesterol-rich debris with a sparse epithelial component and which lack a mixture of anucleate and nucleate squames. On aspiration, pilar tumors yield comparatively more cells and less keratin and show small, basaloid or squamoid cells abruptly associated with keratin globules. The cytologic diagnosis of pilar cysts is important because these cysts recur if incompletely excised and often undergo transformation to pilar tumors. Similarly, pilar tumors often clinically mimic squamous carcinomas, and hence {{there is a need to}} <b>outline</b> <b>definitive</b> cytologic features...|$|R
