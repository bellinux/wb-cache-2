This tool will be presented as an alternative support for those who intervene in the policymaking process, which can be directed towards different parts of those systems. Both numerical and algebraic versions of the SAM will be referred to, while the method to be used in constructing the former from the System of National Accounts (SNA), implemented by the United Nations, will be examined. The SAM’s basic structure and consistency within the whole system will be studied, as well as any possible disaggregations, <b>extensions,</b> aggregates, <b>indicators</b> and balances that can be calculated.

30|$|However, our {{indicator}} set {{is somewhat}} incomplete. Especially, ground-dwelling taxa and soil organisms (e.g. carabids, spiders, mites, collembols, etc.) are neglected so far. Despite their importance and value as indicator groups, we were unfortunately {{not able to}} incorporate these taxa in the first run of BINATS due to financial reasons. Especially, taxa like carabid beetles or spiders are expensive. Determination is time-consuming and standard methods for collection use pitfall traps with all its implications. Trapping is invasive and needs much more coordination with the farmers to get permissions and avoid intended or unintended destruction. But BINATS was designed {{in a way that}} additional indicators like soil-related taxa can easily be integrated.

40|$|Economic models at the micro, meso and macro levels presuppose the {{existence}} of consistent databases that {{make it possible to}} quantify the activity of enterprises, sectors, regions, countries or continents. Such models can also be important aids in the policy decision process, since they permit the construction of scenarios resulting from the adoption of policy measures and the consequent changes that they introduce. When consistent with the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) can include all the nominal flows of the measured part of the economy, at the level of both production and the institutions, and therefore satisfies these requirements. Thus, in its numerical version, a SAM constitutes a database and provides a snapshot of the measured reality at a certain moment, whereas its possible algebraic versions, i. e. models that are based upon it, permit the construction of the above-mentioned scenarios. The possibility and usefulness of constructing SAMs for African countries consistent with the SNA will be examined and experimented. The SAM’s basic structure and consistency within the whole system will be studied, as well as any possible disaggregations, <b>extensions,</b> aggregates, <b>indicators</b> and balances that can be calculated. Other aspects beyond that basic structure will also be examined in order to show to what extent the SAM is capable of covering parts of the economy that are not covered by the SNA. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) can be {{considered}} a tool to be used for measuring a society’s activity. It provides a description of that activity, which can be either empirical or theoretical, depending on whether it is presented in a numerical or an algebraic version, respectively. Special attention will be paid here to the numerical version, and a method will be proposed for its construction from the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). After the first and most fundamental contribution made by Richard Stone, the SNA (with its successive improved versions, from 1953 to 2008) has established a set of rules for measuring a society’s activity, which the statistical offices of countries or groups of countries have adopted and adapted to their specific realities, thus defining their own systems. Through an application of the SAM to Portugal, a basic structure, based on the SNA, will be proposed for this matrix, and its consistency within the whole system will be studied. Possible disaggregations, <b>extensions,</b> aggregates, <b>indicators</b> and balances will be calculated and other aspects beyond that basic structure will also be examined. It will be concluded that using the SNA in a SAM-based approach contributes towards a better modelling of (socio-) economic policy, emphasizing the importance of that approach as a valuable support in policy decision processes...|$|R

Summary: “This paper {{deals with the}} subdifferential of convex analysis defined in the Pareto sense, {{from the point of}} view of nonvacuity, characterizations, and calculus rules and their applications to vector optimization, the convex maps being vector-valued in a finite- or infinite-dimensional ordered vector space. Subdifferentiability is characterized under conditions of Attouch-Brezis type. Formulations by derivatives, when they exist, are provided. Concerning the calculus rules, the first main result gives the gap between the Pareto subdifferential and the ordinary one, allowing thus the computation of the one from the other. Next, as central results, Pareto subdifferentials of the sum and/or composition of two convex vector mappings are developed. The formulas are obtained under Moreau-Rockafellar or Attouch-Brezis type conditions, revealing, strangely, the presence of the ordinary subdifferential. These formulas actually allow the <b>extension</b> of the <b>indicator</b> function technique to the vector case, so that Pareto optimality (efficiency) conditions are easily derived and weakened with qualification conditions of the Attouch-Brezis kind.

40|$|The {{indicator}} domestic {{material consumption}} (domestic extraction + imports – exports) {{is widely used}} to track the scale, composition, and dynamics of material use. As production increasingly occurs at a spatial distance from the demand it ultimately satisfies, new accounting challenges arise that this indicator {{may not be able}} to meet. In response, indicators in raw material equivalents (RME) have been developed to account for material use, no matter where it occurs, associated with final demand. RME indicators are most commonly calculated based on monetary input-output tables with material <b>extensions.</b> The resulting <b>indicators,</b> which are rapidly gaining scientific and political importance, must be interpreted as stemming from a mixed monetary and physical accounting approach. How such an approach differs from a physical accounting approach is shown in this article using an input-output model with a material extension. Neither the physical nor the mixed monetary and physical approach is found to generate results which are incorrect. Instead, the results must be interpreted in light of the assumptions entailed in the approach on which they are based. In making possibilities and limits of interpretation in both cases transparent, RME indicators can more readily be discussed and used by sustainability scientists and practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Increasing Chinese {{urbanization}} and industrialization {{has prompted}} {{greater attention to}} the study of human settlement and the human-land relationship in the fields of geography, architecture, and urban planning. We used bibliometric methods and statistical software to review 180 articles on human settlement in 16 Chinese geographical journals. We found that Chinese geographical human settlement research is characterized by the following: (1) Most research focuses on human settlement <b>extension,</b> valuation <b>indicators,</b> models for urban and rural settlements, theoretical exploration and the planning practices of single-factor, human settlement and complex, geographical livability in macro-scale, urban settlement differentiation and ideal patterns in medium scale, the comprehensive evaluation of settlement environment, and the planning of community units in micro-scale, community settlements; socio-cultural investigation and warnings about advancing human settlement. (2) No {{progress has been made in}} synthesizing and integrating method systems. PSR models and DPSIR models are used for targeting mechanisms, while the standard settlement evaluation system was composed of physical & economic indicators by questionnaire surveys. On the other hand, spatial clustering based on GIS has been a frequent focus in recent years. Pioneering research on human settlement and theoretical systems within the context of China's urbanization and industrialization will provide guidance on the sustainability of Chinese cities and regions. The following five aspects require greater attention: (1) Natural suitability research on human settlement, and a survey of human settlement demands to reflect the range of different demands concerning ecologically suitable settlements in urban environments, the corresponding valuation indicators, systems, and evolution, and the impact of the residents' socio-economic attributes. (2) Spatial-temporal evaluation and sustainability research on urban and rural human settlement at various scales, focusing on evolution and spatial differentiation at various scales such as city clusters and comparisons between cities, within the cities and communities.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{interpretation}} of extravascular indicator dilution experiments is proposed, {{in which the}} indicator is assumed to enter the blood-tissue ex-change region through vascular sources, to equilibrate instantaneously and local-ly between blood and tissue at the capillary-cell level, and, while maintaining this local equilibration, to be transported to vascular sinks by simultaneous diffusion and convection at a more macroscopic distance level. The model has the mathematical form of the time-dependent Fick diffusion equation to which a convection term was added. The model contains as opposite limiting cases the washout-type models and a recently proposed delayed wave model of the indicator dilution process. The various features of the extravascular indicator outflow pattern—appearance time, modal time, semi-log downslope, and dispersion about the mean—are {{described in terms of}} two parameters: (1) a diffusion parameter, square of source-to-sink distance divided by diffusion coefficient of the indicator in the tissue; (2) a convection parameter, the blood flow divided by steady-state solubility volume of distribution of the indicator in the tissue.

Simply put, systems with more diverse institutions perform better than systems with less diverse institutions. Yet the overall diversity of Australia’s higher education system remains unclear. Significant questions and opportunities remain unresolved. How diverse are Australia’s institutions today? How can stakeholders— particularly institutions and policymakers—understand and manage this diversity? In this project the LH Martin Institute and Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) seek to shift discussion of diversity to a more considered level. We don’t promise neat solutions, but our analysis moves beyond extant sectoral partitionings and contingent policy interventions to expose emerging dynamics and prospects for institutions, and hence for the system as a whole. We have produced evidence-based profiles for Australian universities below that mirror those being rolled out globally—namely U-Map and U-Multirank.

Matching variables were: age, gender, number of circulating CD 4 + T lymphocytes, cause of hospital admission, hospitalization in the same ward within the 6 weeks of diagnosis of the case, and length of stay before the day of infection in the case. Eighty-four cases and 168 matched controls were studied. Nosocomial bloodstream infections complicated about 3 of 1000 hospital days per patient in the study period. With step-wise logistic regression analysis, the most important predictors for developing nosocomial bloodstream infections were: increasing value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (p =. 001) and use of central venous catheter (CVC) (p =. 002). The excess of hospital stay attributable to nosocomial bloodstream infections was 17 days. The crude mortality rate was 43 %. The attributable mortality rate {{was estimated to be}} 27 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 13 %- 48 %). The estimated risk ratio for death was 3. 91 (95 % CI = 2. 06 - 7. 44). Multivariate analysis identified two prognostic indicators that were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome of bloodstream infections: number of circulating CD 4 + T cells 15 (p =. 01). Nosocomial bloodstream infections are more common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Important cofactors are high APACHE II score and use of CVC. These infections can cause an excess mortality and significantly prolong the hospital stay of HIV-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{solid state}} {{chemistry}} is inconceivable without theoretical treatment of solids {{thanks to the}} availability of efficient and accurate computational methods. Being developed mainly by physicist's community and {{deeply rooted in the}} formalism of reciprocal space, they often lack connections to familiar chemical concepts, indispensable for the chemical understanding of matter. Quantum chemical topology approach is a powerful theory able to efficiently recover chemical entities from the abstract description of a system given by its density matrices. It can be used to partition any many-electron system into the atoms, using the topology of electron density or for instance into atomic shells, using the topology of ELI-D field. Various characteristics of interactions between these chemical building blocks can be obtained applying bonding indicators, e. g. from the analysis of domain-averaged properties. Quantum chemical topology methods have been extended in the current work for the applications on the diversity of theoretical methods widely used for the description of solids nowadays – from the mean field Kohn-Sham density functional theory to the reduced one-electron density matrices functional theory or from the scalar-relativistic methods to the many-component formalisms employing spinor wavefunctions. It has been shown, that they provide chemically meaningful description of the bonding which is universally applicable to any class of extended systems, be it ionic insulator, covalent solid or metal. It has been shown, that the relativistic effects on the chemical bonding can be easily revealed using <b>extensions</b> of bonding <b>indicators</b> developed in the current work. Classical chemical concepts like Zintl-Klemm concept can be easily recovered with these descriptions. Intimate connection between the class of the material and the degree of chemical bonding delocalization has been also established.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of adjuvant chemotherapy (CMT) {{in patients with}} Stage IIA colon cancer remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate extramural <b>extension</b> as an <b>indicator</b> for adjuvant CMT. Data were reviewed from 202 consecutive patients with Stage IIA colon cancer that underwent curative surgery between 1995 and 2007. The distance of the extramural extension (DEE) was measured histologically. The optimal prognostic cut‐off point of the DEE for oncologic outcomes was statistically determined. The eligible surviving patients had been followed for a median period of 75 months (range: 2 – 210 months). Patients were subdivided into two groups according to the optimal cut‐off point; DEE 5 mm (pT 3 a) and DEE> 5 mm (pT 3 b). The pT 3 b was the most powerful independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence (P 0. 0324, HR: 3. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 098 – 8. 408), and was significantly correlated with distant metastasis (P 0. 0161 HR: 5. 19, 95 % CI: 1. 765 – 15. 239). The recurrence‐free and cancer‐specific 5 ‐year survival rates in patients with pT 3 b were significantly lower than in patients with pT 3 a (81. 5 % vs. 95. 4 %, P 0. 0003 and 85. 9 % vs. 97. 4 %, P 0. 0007, respectively). pT 3 b could be an important risk factor for distant metastasis in Stage IIA colon cancer.

40|$|Brand {{extension}} is {{a common}} branding strategy used by organisation that requires usage of an established brand name in a new category or business area. Brand extensions have received substantial attention from experts in the academic and industry arenas. Despite the prevalence of brand extensions in services, this domain of service brand and brand extension has been left under examined. Businesses are facing fierce competition and every business wants the maximum share of the consumer’s spending and services enhance business competitiveness not only for service brands but also for goods brands. This study examines service brand extensions and the drivers of service brand extension success according to service consumers. Research mainly concentrates to study the underlying motives and intentions for development of perceptions about service brand extensions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in New Zealand to empirically answer the four research questions of the study which are as 1) For services do consumers’ perceive parent brand strength as a reflection for extension quality? And why?, (2) Is fit between parent brand and its extension an over-emphasized or under-emphasized driver for service brand extension evaluation and does it {{play an important role}} in the success of the service extension?, (3) How important is parent brand service competency/ability to supply/provide the extension?, (4) Do consumers perceive the transfer of skills and resources from parent brand to <b>extension</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of brand <b>extension</b> quality? And why? Research entailed studying two service brands which were Super Shuttle and New Zealand Post. To analyse the data collected from semi-structured interviews thematic analysis was employed. Interviews were analysed in Nvivo 9. Themes produced through thematic analysis are as follows (1) Parent Brand and sub-themes are parent brand strength, competency, resource availability solution provider, parent brand knowledge, and brand experience. (2) Fit and sub-themes are brand fit, category fit and similarity with the existing extensions. (3) Service Quality and sub-themes are employee interaction, timely service and service outcome, (4) Reliability and (5) Convenience. Along with these five themes, service extension suggestions were also produced from the semi-structured interviews. Research findings show that consumers do perceive parent brand strength to be a reflector of the service extension quality. Corresponding to research question two, findings suggest that fit between parent brand and extensions is neither an over-emphasized nor under emphasized driver for service brand extension evaluation although it plays a significant role in extension success. Parent service brand’s competency to supply a service brand extension is found to be significant for brand extension success. It was established that brand’s competency to provide an extension was more significant than having adequate resources. Relating to research question four findings establish that employees, transfer of skills and resources have a significant role for service brand extension success...|$|R
