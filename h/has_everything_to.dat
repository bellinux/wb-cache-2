[...] Entertainment Wise reviewer Wil Jones also thought that [...] "Call My Name" [...] wasn't innovative, and compared it to other productions by David Guetta, saying, [...] "a bit of a drop there, the same old floor-to-the-floor beat here, a big synth-y chorus that’s meant to be anthemic but isn’t really, over-produced, bland vocals. 'Call My Name' is isn’t by no means terrible, it’s just very blah." [...] Similarly, Jenn Selby of Glamour noted that [...] "Call My Name" [...] bears resemblance to other productions by Harris, yet admitted that she was surprised with the result of their collaboration, while Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said that the song <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> become the summer's hottest anthem. The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis gave the song a mixed review, criticizing it for being generic and adding that it lacks [...] "the spark that powered Rihanna's We Found Love." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... It <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device {{to give him the}} moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical {{about the future of the}} show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's a doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Grand Prix, Max Verstappen broke several records: {{apart from}} being the {{youngest}} ever driver to win a race at 18 years and 228 days, he also was the youngest to stand on a Formula One podium, in both instances breaking Sebastian Vettel's record set at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix by more than two years. Vettel had been 21 years and 2 months at the time. Verstappen also became the youngest driver to lead at least one lap of a Grand Prix, again overcoming a record set by Vettel, at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Verstappen also was the first driver born in the 1990s to win a Grand Prix. He received considerable praise after the race, with Sky Sports F1's David Croft saying that he [...] "has shown he <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> be a world champion". His father Jos Verstappen, himself a former Grand Prix driver, declared that he considered his son a better driver than himself, as race wins had eluded him during his own career in the sport. French sport newspaper L'Équipe declared Verstappen to be [...] "already a great" [...] and [...] "in the big leagues". Verstappen {{was also the first}} Dutchman to win a race, with the Netherlands becoming the 22nd country to produce a race winner. He was the tenth different winner of the Spanish Grand Prix in as many past editions.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times Jon Pareles wrote, [...] "She's {{the woman}} with everything: the voice, the moves, the songs, the ideas and the clothes. Her two-hour set was a {{brilliant}} pop extravaganza that kept the songs at its center." [...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. Why not just let it be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums {{in a way that made}} every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show. He further noted, ...|$|E

2500|$|Rodriguez absolved the players' {{union of}} any blame for leaking his {{positive}} test results, saying he alone {{was responsible for}} his mistakes. [...] Friend and former teammate Doug Glanville, while noting the outrage over Rodriguez's years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez's critics for their [...] "lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous test could be made public." [...] No Major League player, Glanville wrote, would {{have participated in the}} 2003 survey if he had thought the results had even a chance of becoming public. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with privacy. Being A-Rod should not change that fact." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding Robinson's {{theological}} {{influences in}} Gilead, she herself has explained {{the importance of}} primary Calvinist texts, particularly Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. In regard to Calvin’s Institutes, Robinson states in her Yves Simone lecture entitled [...] "The Freedom of a Christian," [...] that “one of the reasons these texts are important to me is because they <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with my own theology certainly, with my aesthetic perhaps, and {{in so far as}} I can say I have an intention in writing, they <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with my intention”.|$|R

6000|$|Mary {{would make}} no pretence of denying this. It {{was true that}} that one great {{feminine}} possession did belong to her.
