40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for interconnecting isolated clouds of {{an ad hoc}} network that form a scatternet topology using Internet gateways as intermediate nodes. The architecture developed is intended to augment FleetNet, a highly dynamic ad hoc network for inter-vehicle communications. This is achieved by upgrading FleetNet capabilities to establish a communication path between moving vehicles and the Internet via Internet gateways to facilitate direct <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>gateway</b> communications via the Internet, thus bridging gaps in the network topology and relaying packets closer towards their geographical destination at the same time. After outlining the overall FleetNet approach and its underlying geographical multi-hop routing, {{we focus on the}} FleetNet gateway architecture. We describe required modifications to the gateway architecture and to the FleetNet network layer in order to use these gateways as intermediate nodes for FleetNet routing. Finally, we conclude the paper by a short discussion on the prototype gateway implementation and by summarizing first results and ongoing work on inter scatternet communication. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{increased}} popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) together with the continuous technological advances in wireless communication, also increase the interest for ad hoc networks. An ad hoc network is a wireless, autonomous, infrastructure-less network composed of stations that communicate with each other directly in a peer-to-peer fashion. When discussing mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), we often refer to an ad hoc network where the stations cooperate in forwarding packets on behalf of each other to allow communication beyond their transmission range over multi-hop paths. In order to realize the practical benefits of ad hoc networks, two challenges (among others) need to be considered: distributed quality of service (QoS) guarantees and multi-hop Internet access. This thesis presents conceivable solutions to both of these problems. The first two papers focus on the network layer and consider the provisioning of Internet access to ad hoc networks whereas the last two papers focus on the data link layer and investigate the provisioning of QoS to ad hoc networks. The first paper studies the interconnection between a MANET and the Internet. In addition, it evaluates three approaches for gateway discovery, which can be initiated by the gateway (proactive method), by the mobile station (reactive method) or by mixing these two approaches (hybrid method). The second paper also studies Internet access for MANETs, but with focus on micro mobility, i. e. mobile stations moving from one gateway to another. In particular, it evaluates a solution that allows mobile stations to access the Internet and roam from <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>gateway.</b> The third paper, gives an overview of the medium access mechanisms in IEEE 802. 11 and their QoS limitations. Moreover, it proposes an enhancement to the contention-free medium access mechanism of IEEE 802. 11 e to provide QoS guarantees in WLANs operating in ad hoc network configuration. The fourth paper continues the work from the third paper by enhancing the scheme and dealing with the problems that occur due to hidden stations. Furthermore, it discusses {{how to deal with the}} problems that occur when moving from single-hop ad hoc networks (i. e. WLANs in ad hoc network configuration) to multi-hop ad hoc networks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we present}} a {{mathematical}} model for a novel TCP congestion control approach called Receiver-Window Modification (RWM). RWM could be used {{with any of the}} present Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes, such as Random Early Detection (RED), Adaptive Random Early Detection (ARED), and BLUE queues to reduce congestion at the ingress and gateway routers. We extend the work done on stochastic modeling of RED-ECN <b>gateways</b> <b>to</b> RED-RWM <b>gateways.</b> Using this model, we provide a weak convergence theorem for the number of connections; thus leading the way to more relaxed configuration of RED-RWM gateway parameters. We use a Monte Carlo simulation method to compare outcomes of our mathematical model with those of NS 2 simulation experiments. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{provide a}} costeffective way of {{deploying}} a network and providing broadband Internet access. In WMNs {{a subset of}} nodes called <b>gateways</b> provide connectivity <b>to</b> the wired infrastructure (typically the Internet). Because traffic volume of WMNs {{is expected to be}} high, and due to limited wireless link capacity, <b>gateways</b> are likely <b>to</b> become a potential bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a distributed load-balancing protocol where <b>gateways</b> coordinate <b>to</b> reroute flows from congested <b>gateways</b> <b>to</b> underutilized <b>gateways.</b> Unlike other approaches, our scheme takes into account the effects of interference. This makes it suitable for implementation in practical scenarios, achieving good results, and improving on shortest path routing. Also, it is load-sensitive and can improve network utilization in both balanced and skewed topologies. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms all schemes tested. We have observed throughput gains of up to 80 % over the shortest path algorithm. I...|$|R
40|$|Internet and {{multimedia}} services are widely-provided in All-IP based networks. There {{has been growing}} demand for mobile users to get those services. The Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) extends communication range and provides Internet connectivity to mobile users with low upfront investment. In WMN, the traffic usually passes through the gateway and makes it become the common destination of the traffic. Conventional multipath routing protocols in the ad hoc networks do not allow intermediate nodes to reply the route request messages, so the flooding messages make the area near the gateway become congested and degrade the performance. In this paper, we proposed Gateway Zone Multi-path Routing (GZMR) protocol. GZMR uses nodes around the <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> form a <b>Gateway</b> Cooperative Zone and ceases the routing control messages flooding from outside the zone. Border nodes in the zone can help replying <b>gateway</b> information <b>to</b> reduce route discovery delay. Our simulation results show that by lowering routing overheads and utilizing multiple paths from source <b>to</b> <b>gateway,</b> GZMR can shorten average end-to-end delay and improve the packet delivery in WMNs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering"July 2007. "In {{the current}} storage era, Fibre Channel (FC) {{protocol}} {{is used for}} high performance and reliability, providing different levels of service with 1 Gbps to 4 Gbps physical interfaces. FC transports Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) data, between storage devices. FC spans from 500 meters to 10 Kilometers [27, 28] using multimode, single mode fibers respectively, limiting the storage to a site or between two sites. In order to overcome this distance limitation and implementation costs, Fibre Channel over Internet Protocol (FCIP) and Internet Fiber Channel Protocol (iFCP) were introduced [30, 31]. FCIP tunnels the fibre channel frames over Internet between two fiber switches, with in the same network. iFCP is an IP Based <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> <b>gateway</b> protocol, which interconnects different FC-SANs. Again, all these protocols are involved with fiber channels which increase the cost. iSCSI is a new IETF standardized protocol[26], which transports SCSI data over Internet. Advancements in Ethernet technologies from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps make iSCSI deployment to yield better results in terms of performance and can be very cost effective compared to FCIP and iFCP. Some of the widely used storage applications in the industry are archiving and mirroring, these applications are used for backup/recovery process in IT industry. Archiving is {{a process in which}} data is written to portable media such as optical disks or magnetic tapes. Mirroring is a process of data replicated on the remote disk. Mirroring can be done in two ways, synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous mirroring, when ever there is an update with data, it is written to both local and remote disk at the same time. In asynchronous mirroring, data is updated periodically irrespective of the actual update. If iSCSI is used for remote mirroring, end users need to ensure the performance of iSCSI should meet the requirements of the application. Most of the studies proved deficient in considering some or the other aspects. In this research work, the author presents the modeling and analysis of iSCSI between two SAN Islands considering iSCSI level errors, which will enable the IT industry to use this model for their analyze before they actually deploy. Throughout the analysis, the author employs asynchronous mirroring between the SAN Islands. iSCSI level errors need to be considered when the SCSI data is on the Internet, which will seriously effect the performance of the application in real time. The prototype was analyzed using TCP/IP and UDP traffic with both dedicated links and Internet links. When iSCSI is used to interconnect different SAN islands, one should ensure its performance to meet the application requirements. The bandwidth management for time critical applications like synchronous and asynchronous mirroring is essential while analyzing performance on IP networks, for this the key operations of iSCSI like iSCSI read, iSCSI write were modeled. Also, the throughput under realistic traffic conditions varying different parameters like network types, round trip time, bandwidth and distance was modeled. Security is another important attribute which should be taken in to account while IP networks are involved. It is essential to consider security of data while block level data is being transferred between two storage islands using iSCSI. The errors processed by this protocol on the IP network were considered and suitable iSCSI error recovery procedures were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|When a Mobile Ad Hoc network (MANET) is {{connected}} to the Internet, it is important for mobile nodes <b>to</b> detect available Internet <b>gateway</b> (IGW) providing access <b>to</b> the Internet. <b>Gateway</b> discovery time have strong influence on packet delay and throughput. In most of the cases, a mobile node uses min- hops <b>to</b> the <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> communicate a fixed host connected to an Internet. However, a minimum hop path may not always be efficient if some nodes along the path have longer interface queue of waiting packets. Thus, the focus of the paper is to first analyse existing load-aware routing protocols in MANET and then based on this analysis, devise a proactive load-aware gateway discovery scheme that takes in to account size of interface queue in addition to the traditional min hop metric. This approach also allows an efficient handoff from one Internet <b>gateway</b> <b>to</b> another Internet <b>gateway</b> and still maintains a seamless connectivity to a fixed host. We examine the impact of traffic load and node mobility in terms of two metrics: throughput and average end-to-end delay to assess the performance of the proposed protocol. Simulation results indicate that our protocol outperforms existing solution...|$|R

In this architecture, vehicles are dynamically clus-tered according to different related metrics. From these clusters, a minimum number of vehicles, equipped with IEEE 802. 11 p and UTRAN interfaces, are selected as vehicular <b>gateways</b> <b>to</b> link VANET to UMTS. Issues pertaining <b>to</b> <b>gateway</b> selection, gateway advertisement and discovery, service migration between gateways (i. e., when serving gateways lose their optimality) are all ad-dressed and an adaptive mobile gateway management mechanism is proposed.

40|$|The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) {{was first}} {{introduced}} by a technology pioneer Kevin Ashton in 1999. Although the term is relatively new, {{the idea of making}} networks and computers communicate in order totrack and manage devices has been around for many years. As of now IoT is a rising topic in technicalcommunity. Some specialists are anticipating that by 2025 there will be around 100 billion connected IoTdevices with a worldwide economic impact of more than $ 11 trillion. On the other hand, Internet of Thingsemerges significant challenges. Currently the organization around world use two main approaches whenentering the IoT market. First one is an open platform and is represented by interoperability andcollaboration with devices from different vendors. Second one is a closed platform, or a “walled garden”approach. A “walled garden” approach is characterized by building “fences” around the user. In other words,the service provider has control over applications, content and media and also restricts the non-approvedcontent to reach the customer. Therefore, the research set out to explore these approaches and show thebenefits and limits they can have on an organization. The research was conducted in collaboration with aSwedish manufacturer of outdoor power products called Husqvarna Group. In order to fully acknowledgethe organization’s approach, 4 interviews were conducted with managers, back end developers andconsultants hired by Husqvarna Group. From the findings, some things should be taken in consideration. First, IoT involves big data being collected, therefore security and privacy are crucial when developingdevices and systems. Second, it is essential for an organization to have the same views when taking a newdirection. Third, when discussing Internet of Things, it means that things connect, devices <b>to</b> sensors,sensor <b>to</b> <b>gateways</b> and <b>gateways</b> <b>to</b> system. And there shouldn’t be a delimitation from a vendor to another. Therefore, open platform approach is seen as the way to diversity and innovation...|$|R
