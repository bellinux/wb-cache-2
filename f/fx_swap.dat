It has also led to a revival of practical central bank co-operation. This paper explains how things have changed. The main innovation in central bank cooperation during this crisis was the emergency provision of international liquidity through bilateral central bank swap facilities, which have evolved to form interconnected swap networks. We discuss the reasons for establishing swap facilities, relate {{the probability of a}} country receiving a swap line in a currency to a measure of currency-specific liquidity shortages based on the BIS international banking statistics, and find a significant relationship {{in the case of the}} US dollar, the euro, the yen and the Swiss franc. We also discuss the role and effectiveness of swap lines in relieving currency-specific liquidity shortages, the risks that central banks run in extending swap lines and the limitations to their utility in relieving liquidity pressures.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the financial system on central bank and government support 1 How much does the banking sector depend on public support? Utilisation of many support facilities has declined, due mainly to a fall in demand. Supply factors play a smaller, but not insignificant role, as governments and central banks have tightened the conditions on which certain support measures are available or have phased them out entirely. However, not all financial institutions have reduced their use of support facilities. Weaker banks especially continue to depend on public support. JEL classification: E 5, G 2. Over the past few months, authorities have taken their first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place {{in response to the}} financial crisis. For instance, the Federal Reserve completed its purchase of Treasury securities in October 2009; new issuance under the UK credit guarantee scheme ended in December; the ECB conducted a last 12 -month euro repo and the Bank of Japan stopped its purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds in the same month; and the Swiss National Bank ceased providing Swiss francs through foreign exchange (<b>FX)</b> <b>swaps</b> against euros in January 2010. Thus, the exit has begun. This feature analyses the use of central bank liquidity facilities and government debt guarantees 2 to assess to what extent the financial system continues to depend on those measures. The take-up of many measures has declined. On the one hand, this seems to reflect better market access and hence reduced demand for government support. On the other hand, supply conditions have also become more restrictive, at least for some facilities. There is also some evidence of tiering in the use of government debt guarantees...|$|R

We find that the use of swap markets to overcome US dollar funding shortages by non-US financial institutions resulted in marked deviations from covered interest parity conditions and the impairment of liquidity in these markets. JEL classification: G 12, G 14, G 15. Foreign exchange (FX) and related derivatives markets are some of the most liquid markets in the world. The growth of interest rate and FX/currency swaps is often cited as a factor promoting the further integration of global financial markets.

Our analysis of swap market deviations from covered interest parity and the impairment of liquidity in the swap markets is consistent with anecdotal market observations that dollar funding shortages of non-US financial institutions were largely responsible. In the next section, we review the money market turbulence in four currencies: US dollar, euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen.

40|$|After 2007, {{financial}} market turmoil began and shortage of dollar funding liquidity disrupted {{not only the}} US dollar funding market but also overseas.

The paper discusses the main feature of the FED’s swap lines {{in the context of}} the funding pressures on the <b>FX</b> <b>swap</b> market. The main objective of the paper is to reveal technical aspects and effectiveness of the swap lines.

The paper concludes that the swap lines were an effective tool of cooperation between central banks and significantly alleviated the pressure on the <b>FX</b> <b>swap</b> market. In addition, the swap lines were flexible, supported financial stability, no losses were recorded, the problem of adverse selection was avoided and exit was successful.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} (FX) derivatives {{markets in}} the Korean won are comparatively thin and vulnerable to impaired functioning. During the crisis, Korea faced dislocations in its <b>FX</b> <b>swap</b> and cross-currency swap markets, so severe that covered interest parity (CIP) between the Korean won and the US dollar was seriously violated. Using {{a variation of the}} EGARCH model, we find that global market uncertainty - as proxied by VIX, the volatility index - was the main factor explaining the movement of deviations from CIP in the three-month <b>FX</b> <b>swap</b> market during the crisis period. The credit risk of Korean banks - as proxied by their credit default swap spread - was also a significant factor explaining deviations from CIP in the three-year cross-currency swap market before the crisis, while the credit risk of US banks was significant during the crisis period. The Bank of Korea's provision of funds using its own foreign reserves was not effective in reducing deviations from CIP, but the Bank of Korea's loans of the US dollar proceeds of swaps with the US Federal Reserve were effective. This is because the loans funded by swaps with the US Federal Reserve effectively added to Korea's foreign reserves and enhanced market confidence. <b>FX</b> <b>swap,</b> cross-currency swap, regime switching, EGARCH model, foreign reserves...|$|E
