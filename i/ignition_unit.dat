Department of Energy (US DOE) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funds for {{research}} and development to improve the efficiency in ethanol powered aircraft, measure performance and compare emissions of ethanol, Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (ETBE) and 100 LL aviation gasoline. The premise of the initial proposal was to use a test stand owned by Engine Components Inc. (ECI) based in San Antonio, Texas. After the grant was awarded, ECI decided to close down its test stand facility. Since there were no other test stands available at that time, RAFDC was forced to find additional support to build its own test stand. Baylor University provided initial funds for the test stand building. Other obstacles had to be overcome in order to initiate the program. The price of the emission testing equipment had increased substantially beyond the initial quote. Rosemount Analytical Inc. gave RAFDC an estimate of $ 120, 000. 00 for a basic emission testing package. RAFDC had to find additional funding to purchase this equipment. The electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>unit</b> also presented a series of time consuming problems. Since at that time there were no off-the-shelf units of this type available, one had to be specially ordered and developed. FAA funds were used to purchase a Super Flow dynamometer. Due to the many unforeseen obstacles, much more time and effort than originally anticipated had to be dedicated to the project, with much of the work done on a volunteer basis. Many people contributed their time to the program. One person, mainly responsible for the initial design of the test stand, was a retired engineer from Allison with extensive aircraft engine test stand experience. Also, many Baylor students volunteered to assemble the. test stand and continue {{to be involved in the}} current test program. Although the program presented many challenges, which resulted in delays, the RAFDC's test stand is an asset which provides an ongoing research capability dedicated to the testing of alternative fuels for aircraft engines.

For the liquid fuel, the igniter was replaced by a torch igniter specially made for liquid fuels. Four different gases were evaluated; methane, propane, CO 2 and N 2 in order to see the effect of both various hydrocarbons and various inert gases. A model was developed for the gaseous experiments to estimate the limit for the maximum amount of inert gases the gas turbine would be able to start on. The model suggested that CO 2 would require a larger amount of energy than N 2 for the same amount in the composition, but that varying hydrocarbons did not have any effect if looking at the mass % of inert gas in the composition. The model was also extended with ethane and hydrogen but no experiments were performed with these gases. The model gave satisfying results. It overestimated the maximum amount of inert gases which could be mixed with propane, but agreed well when comparing the two inert gases with each other. Other interesting results were that an increased fuel flow decreased the minimum ignition energy and that an increased air flow gave a minor decrease in the maximum amount of inert gases that was possible to ignite. The torch igniter for the liquid fuel worked in a satisfying way. The ignition energy was however too low, so the ignition reliability was low.

Many owners would swap the units for an older point-ignition system for reliability.

With many Shovelhead owners having to turn towards aftermarket parts to keep the bike running properly, Harley-Davidson realized {{they would have to}} start developing a new engine. Towards the end of the Shovelhead's production, Harley-Davidson made numerous modifications in an attempt to keep the engine usable for production. Belt drive was added to their motorcycles in 1980 to prevent the oil leakage from the enclosed chain, along with a 5-speed transmission and rubber motor mounts to help reduce vibration. In 1981, Harley Davidson purchased AMF's share of the company back, adding a new oil pump, improved valve guides, and lowering the compression to help the engines run on the lower quality gasoline in the United States. The engine was produced until 1984, where the Evolution engine, which had aluminum heads and barrels, began to take over on most models. The engine could still be found in certain models such as the FLH in 1985, but was shortly replaced by the succeeding Evolution engine.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} spark {{ignition}} of various turbulent non-premixed flames namely, jet, counter-flow and bluff-body flames. This detailed fundamental study of spark ignition aims to provide useful information for solving the high-altitude relight {{problem in the}} aviation gas turbine. A specially designed <b>ignition</b> <b>unit</b> has been built. Different spark parameters and flow conditions have been examined to study their effects on the ignition probability defined as successful flame establishment. The ignition probability results have been correlated with the measured or estimated flow velocity and mixture fraction. The whole ignition and flame propagation events have been visualized by a high-speed camera and OH-PLIF. In the jet flames, {{it was found that}} after an initially spherical shape, the flame took a cylindrical shape with a propagating edge upstream. The probability of successful ignition P ign increases with high spark energy, thin electrode diameter and wide gap, but decreases with increasing dilution of the jet with air. The flame kernel growth rate is high when the ignition probability is high for all parameters, except for jet velocity. Increasing the jet velocity decreases the ignition probability at all locations. The estimated net propagation speed relative to the incoming flow was about 3 to 6 laminar burning velocities of a stoichiometric mixture S L. In the counter-flow flames, {{it was found that the}} flame spread as an edge flame with a large scatter in its radial position. P ign decreased with bulk velocity, which suggests that the local strain rate can be detrimental to ignition so that, even with the strongest spark tested, ignition could not be achieved at a bulk velocity about 90 % of the extinction velocity. P ign was greater than zero even in regions well into the fuel and air streams where the mixture fraction fluctuations were virtually zero, giving zero probability of finding flammable mixture at the spark location. The estimated edge flame speed relative to the radial flow is higher than S L for the premixed flame and is less than S L for the non-premixed flames.

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the <b>ignition</b> control <b>unit.</b> The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the combined effects of thermal expansion and gravity on the initiation {{and evolution of}} triple flames. In particular, we provide a possible criterion for the thermal energy per unit depth required for triple flame ignition by a cylindrical ignition kernel.

The flame tube solutions are unstable; in time-dependent simulations {{it is found that}} initial perturbations increasing the thermal energy of flame tubes lead to the propagation of a triple flame, while perturbations decreasing the thermal energy lead to extinction.

Air temperatures during the fires ranged from 13 – 23 °C, and relative humidities ranged from 30 – 42 %. Windspeeds varied from 0 – 16 km hr− 1. Flame lengths ranged from 0.2 – 1.0 m. Because of early greenup in 2004, fire spread was patchy. On each burn unit, post-fire sampling teams visually estimated percent area burned on a 900 m 2 plot surrounding each of 30 – 35 sampling points per unit, so approximately 30 percent of each unit was sampled. Burn-only units had fire coverage of 35 and 50 %, while thin-burn units had coverage of 23 and 51 %.|$|R
50|$|On May 25, Skylab 2 {{lifted from}} LC-39B, the first Saturn IB launch in {{almost five years}} and only the second-ever launch from Pad 39B. Booster {{performance}} was nominal except for one momentary glitch that could have threatened the mission - when the Commit signal {{was sent to the}} Saturn at <b>ignition,</b> the instrument <b>unit</b> sent a command to switch the launch vehicle from internal to external power. This would have shut down the Saturn's electrical system, but not the propulsion system and likely cause the disaster scenario of an uncontrollable booster, requiring the Launch Escape System to be activated and the Command Module pulled away to safety, followed by Range Safety destroying the errant launch vehicle. However, the duration of the cutoff signal was less than one second, too short a time for the electrical relay in the booster to be activated, thus nothing happened and the launch proceeded as planned. This glitch was traced to a modification of the pad electrical equipment and corrective steps were subsequently taken to prevent it from happening again. On reaching the station, Conrad flew their Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) around it to inspect the damage, then soft-docked with it to avoid the necessity of station keeping while the crew ate, and flight controllers planned the first repair attempt. Then they undocked so that Conrad could position the Apollo by the jammed solar panel, so that Weitz could perform a stand-up EVA, trying to free the array by tugging at it with a 10-foot hooked pole, while Kerwin held onto his legs. This failed, and consumed a significant amount of the Skylab's nitrogen maneuvering fuel to keep it steady in the process.|$|R
