40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} tomography is {{well suited}} to find and map subsurface cavities because {{of its ability to}} detect resistive features and discriminating subtle resistivity variations. The Linares area (Jaén, Spain), where an important mining activity on metallic sulphides ores was developed, has been selected for this study. This activity has produced a large volume of mining voids. Electrical resistivity tomography is a <b>geophysical</b> <b>tool</b> well suited to the detection and mapping of known and unknown mining voids. The technique is capable of discriminating between the developing cavities, where the target is primarily conductive weathered material, and the empty voids comprising resistive air-filled cavities. Such cavities may be water-filled, in which case they are likely to yield conductive anomalies as the water would be significantly more conductive than the surrounding material (unweathered granite in this case).

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} two-dimensional, digitally integrating silicon vidicon system (McCord and Westphal, 1972) to differentiate terrestrial rock structure and mineralization was explored. The potential usefulness of the vidicon system {{for the detection of}} natural resources is based on its ability to pho-tometrically detect the spectral signature of terrestrial miner-als in the spectral range 400 oo. to 1100. 0 nanometers and pro-duce two-dimensional imagery. Interpretation of the imagery is based on developing libraries of recorded reflection spectra of geologic materials and the semiquantitative explanation of spec-tral features by Crystal Field Theory. The instrumentation was tested for its ability to: dif-ferentiate minerals; resolve detailed mineralized rock structure; enhance imagery of rock structure and/or mineralized features using computer software techniques; identify mineralogy without prior ground truth; distinguish altered from unaltered rock units associated with porphyry copper deposits; perform as a practical <b>geophysical</b> <b>tool</b> in the field. It is concluded that the vidicon system is a potentially powerful <b>geophysical</b> <b>tool</b> that should be applied to geological problems by using remote-sensing techniques.

Availability of new geomagnetic measurements from low-altitude satellites and from the expanding observatory network has also inspired development of fully three-dimensional (3 -D) techniques (Koyama et al., 2006; Kelbert et al., 2008, 2009; Shimizu et al., 2010; Tarits and Mandea, 2010; Kuvshinov and Semenov, 2012; Semenov and Kuvshinov, 2012).

40|$|Direct {{mapping of}} {{variability}} in soils {{can be a}} complex, time-consuming and costly process. Consequently, maps of geophysical data such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) are commonly used as proxies for soil maps, and these geophysical maps are most useful if they relate to variations in plant attributes such as grapevine trunk circumference. This article demonstrates that vine trunk circumference in five pinot noir vineyards is primarily influenced by changes in slope, elevation and aspect. Variability in GPR maps shows mixed correlations with vine trunk circumference data. In contrast, multi-frequency EMI surveys yield soil apparent electrical conductivity data that commonly show significant correlations with variations in vine trunk circumference data, especially when coupled with global positioning system surveys, suggesting {{that this is the}} preferred <b>geophysical</b> <b>tool</b> for mapping variability in soils...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{the current}} {{petroleum}} exploration model {{does not allow}} for a fundamental alteration of the order of the <b>geophysical</b> investigation <b>tools</b> employed, while still predominantly relying on the use of seismic surveys. Alternative <b>geophysical</b> investigation <b>tools</b> have barely made inroads in exploration budgets, in relation to seismic tools (Barclays Capital 2010, apud Peebler 2010, p. 5). In fact, the industry trend is to concentrate even more of its geophysical exploration budget on the most expensive form of seismic acquisition, 3 D seismic surveys, which reached over 85 % market share in 2015 (Transparency Market Research 2017). The O&G industry still operates on the “Seismic is King” rule (Bamford 2015).
