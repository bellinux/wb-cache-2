5|$|Bada Bing!, a {{strip club}} owned and {{operated}} by the character Silvio Dante on the show, is an actual strip club on Route 17 in Lodi, New Jersey. Exteriors and interiors (except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room) were shot on location. The club is called Satin Dolls and was an existing business before the show started.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented, the canvas cover <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights. A SS-6 sonar was fitted in June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Simpson {{family has}} barricaded {{all the doors}} and windows except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door, which Homer forgot to do. Several zombies break into the house: Homer sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the zombies leave him when they realize he does not have enough brains for them to eat. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse the spell. The Simpsons arrive at the Springfield Elementary library and Bart casts the {{appropriate}} counter spell, causing all zombies to return to their graves.|$|E

30|$|Results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> tracks {{considerably}} {{differ from}} <b>the</b> ones obtained <b>for</b> <b>the</b> solo tracks. In this case, {{the use of}} CAM results in decreased IPS and TPS scores and consequently in considerably lower OPS scores. However, a considerable improvement is observed in APS scores <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> tracks when CAM is used. An inverse relationship is also observed, this time between TPS and IPS scores, and APS scores of the backing: increased APS scores always come with decreased TPS and IPS scores and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Mogador was {{refitted}} at Lorient between January and March 1940 and {{a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during her sea trials a year prior were finally implemented, the canvas cover <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights. A SS-6 sonar was fitted in June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E
25|$|The cello is {{typically}} made from carved wood, although other {{materials such as}} carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in {{elementary and secondary school}} orchestras and youth orchestras, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., {{they are less likely to}} crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.|$|E

25|$|Flatback mandolins use a {{thin sheet}} of wood with bracing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> as a guitar uses, {{rather than the}} bowl of the bowlback or the arched back of the carved mandolins.|$|E
25|$|Except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> Bay {{and part}} of the South Boston neighborhoods, Boston has no street grid. The City of Boston, {{composed}} of many smaller towns annexed over the years, retained most of the pre-existing street names, resulting in many duplicates throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{are aimed}} at {{improving}} posture, strengthening back and chest muscles, and enhancing exercise capacity, ideally also increasing chest expansion. Pectus exercises include deep breathing and breath holding exercises, as well as strength training <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and chest muscles. Additionally, aerobic exercises to improve cardiopulmonary function are employed.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{interactive}} resource which {{allows students to}} experiment with the design of stage sets and use of props. Students can select {{from a range of}} materials and designs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing,</b> <b>the</b> flats, and <b>the</b> stage floor <b>for</b> example, and drag and drop from a choice of props in order to build up their own stage set. ...|$|R
30|$|Consistently high IPS were {{obtained}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> solo signals. This evidences {{the fact that}} special care was taken, specially in the post-processing stage (Subsubsection 4.1. 5), to remove all traces of interference in the solo signals. However, such IPS scores {{come at the expense}} of low TPS and APS. These results suggest that our spectral estimation approach might be too strict, resulting in target sources reconstructed out of accurate but restricted time-frequency information. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> tracks, more homogeneous measures {{were obtained}}. Results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> tracks show high TPS as well as high APS. These results support once again the fact that a very conservative solo extraction approach has been taken, resulting in a minimum amount of intervention <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extraction of <b>backing</b> tracks and resulting in high APS and TPS scores.|$|R
50|$|Paul Worley told Billboard {{magazine}} in 1998 that {{the entirety of}} <b>the</b> track, except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> vocals, was recorded in one day, while other tracks on the album were recorded in pieces over time.|$|R
25|$|The archaic letter Koppa (Ϙ), used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{allophone}} of /k/ before back vowels , {{was originally}} common to most epichoric alphabets. It began {{to drop out}} of use {{from the middle of the}} 6th century BC. Some of the Doric regions, notably Corinth, Argos, Crete and Rhodes, kept it until the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Several streets {{surrounding}} the Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.'s Back Bay Fens in Boston, Massachusetts, were designated with Burns connotations. A life-size statue was dedicated in Burns's honour within the Back Bay Fens of the West Fenway neighbourhood in 1912. It stood until 1972 {{when it was}} relocated downtown, sparking protests from the neighbourhood, literary fans, and preservationists of Olmsted's vision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> Bay Fens.|$|E
25|$|In the backfield, Michigan lost {{starters}} Elroy Hirsch, Bill Daley, and Paul White. The team returned five lettermen to the backfield, including fullback Bob Wiese, {{who started}} all nine games in 1943 and {{was chosen as}} captain of the 1944 team, fullback Don Lund, who started one game in 1943, and quarterback Joe Ponsetto, a non-starter in 1943. Michigan backfield coach Earl Martineau's other candidates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> positions included: Gene Derricotte, a halfback from Ohio; and Bob Nussbaumer, a halfback from Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Writing and {{pre-production}} {{was done}} at Blah Street Studios in Hampshire. Trident Studios in London were used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> majority of the recordings, including drums, bass and samples <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> track, and <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> vocals, which included three female session singers and male vocals by Williams' guitarist Gary Nuttall. Williams' vocals were done at Jacobs Studios in Surrey.|$|R
5000|$|Jana Mirković and {{her four}} dancers {{were dressed in}} their costumes: a green dress and dark blue jacket <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Montenegrin {{representative}} and entirely dark blue dresses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> dancers. <b>The</b> backdrop started with clouds and rain and then everything turned into a colorful city night-scene.|$|R
50|$|When used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> {{and sides}} of {{high-end}} acoustic guitars, Okoume (or {{as it is known}} in the trade, Akoumé) exhibits many of the tonal properties of maple. Guitars made with Okoumé are noticeably lighter in weight than those made with mahogany or rosewood.|$|R
25|$|The iPhone 5C has new LTE antennas {{that now}} cover more LTE bands {{than any other}} {{smartphone}} according to Apple. The device {{is made up of}} a unibody hard-coated polycarbonate body with a steel-reinforced frame, which also acts as an antenna. The iPhone 5C is available in multiple bright colors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> — blue, green, pink, yellow, and white, with a black glass front. It features a 4-inch Retina, multi-touch display, which has a 640×1136nbsp&pixel resolution. Storage capacities available are fixed at 8, 16, or 32nbsp&GB; plug-in memory card are not supported.|$|E
25|$|All three {{cameras were}} CCDs {{manufactured}} by Eastman Kodak Company, and were {{controlled by the}} rover's CPU. They all had auto-exposure and capabilities for handling bad pixels, and the image parameters (exposure time, compression used, etc.) {{were included in the}} transmitted images as part of the image header. The rover could compress the front cameras' images using the block truncation coding (BTC) algorithm, but it could only do the same <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> camera's images if the colour information was discarded. The cameras' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6cm details across a 0.65m range.|$|E
25|$|For the {{observer}} {{standing on the}} platform, on the other hand, {{the rear of the}} traincar is moving (catching up) toward {{the point at which the}} flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light will strike the ends of the traincar at different times.|$|E
50|$|This {{unit was}} {{designed}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> up of Neo-Geo Pocket and Neo-Geo Pocket Color games.

25|$|For a February collector's edition issue, People {{magazine}} ran {{a special}} cover honoring the 50th anniversary. TV Guide, itself celebrating its 60th anniversary {{with a special}} edition issue, had an in-depth four-page feature about General Hospitals anniversary and a full-page advertisement for the event on its back cover. The feature reflected on the show's troubled state {{a year before the}} anniversary, its resurgence, and past revivals. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> cover, the magazine depicted an image from the 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura formed by a collage of images from the show. Both the feature and back cover ad were well received by soap opera commentators.|$|E
25|$|When a man {{proposed}} to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed {{to him by}} her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went {{to the house of}} a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.|$|E
25|$|Hardie {{recalled}} that he originally offered the band a design {{based on an}} old club sign in San Francisco – a multi-sequential image of a phallic zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums {{and a number of}} early press advertisements. Most prints of the album have the band name and the Atlantic Records logo on the cover in red, but on some prints such as the iTunes Store release of the album they can be found in orange instead. During the first few weeks of the album's availability in the UK, some prints of the album sleeve featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector's item.|$|E
