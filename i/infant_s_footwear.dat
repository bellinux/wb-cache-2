40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the actual situation of maternal distress regarding 1 -year-old <b>infant</b> <b>s</b> cries. 　A self-completed questionnaire survey was performed 1 year after birth among 305 mothers who gave birth to term infants at maternity hospitals in the Hokuriku region. The survey content included : state of infant cries (characteristics of the cry and frequency, occurrence of crying at night, and the period when cries at night were observed), mother s sleeping condition and health condition, status of night feeding, support, feelings of mothers, and period when mothers began to understand {{the reasons for the}} <b>infant</b> <b>s</b> cries. In this study, the frequency of maternal distress regarding <b>infant</b> <b>s</b> crying was converted to a score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of distress related to crying. The number of valid responses was 251 (rate of valid response, 82. 3 %). One hundred eighty-five mothers reported night crying (73. 7 %), and night crying occurred most often around 6 to 8 months. The period when mothers felt they understood the reasons for the <b>infant</b> <b>s</b> cries was at 7 to 8 months in the majority of cases, and 1 year at the latest. At 1 year after birth, only approximately 20 % of mothers reported feelings of distress related to crying. The results indicated that maternal distress associated with child crying is related to nuclear family, presence of someone to talk to about childcare, characteristics of <b>infant</b> <b>s</b> cry, mother s health condition, and mother s feelings toward childcare. １年児の泣きとその母親の泣きに対する困難感の実態を明らかにすることを目的とし た。 　北陸地方の病産院にて正期産児を出産した母親３０５名を対象に、出生後１年時に、自己記 入式質問紙調査を実施した。調査内容は、児の泣きの状態（泣き方の特徴や頻度、夜泣き の有無と夜泣きの時期等）、母親の睡眠・健康状態、夜間の授乳状況、サポート状況、児が 泣いた時の母親の気持ちや泣きの理由がわかるようになった時期などである。本研究にお いては、児が泣くと戸惑う母親の頻度を得点化し、得点が高いほど、泣きに対する困難感 が高いと解釈した。有効回答は２５１名（有効回答率８２３. %）であった。乳児の夜泣きは、１８５ 名（７３７. ％）の母親にみられ、夜泣きの時期は６～８ヶ月頃が最も多かった。母親が児の泣 きの理由がわかるようになったと感じる時期は、大部分が７～８ヶ月頃から遅くとも１年 までであった。１年時においては、泣きに対して戸惑う母親は２割程度であった。泣きに 対する母親の困難感には、核家族、子育て相談者の存在、児の泣きの特性、母親の健康状態、 育児に対する母親の気持ちやなどが関連していることが明らかとなった。[原著:Originals...|$|R

Or, by dispersing production across multiple facilities, firms can benefit from product-specific efficiencies and enhanced organizational learning. When choosing to organize in multiple units, firms must also decide where to locate these units. Concentrating production geographically can enhance economies of scale and facilitate organizational learning. On the other hand, dispersing facilities might allow the firm to lower transportation costs, reduce risks, and forbear competition. To examine these tradeoffs, we compare exit rates of single-unit organizations to multiunit organizations and their constituent plants in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>footwear</b> industry between 1940 and 1989.

Consistent with ecological arguments, plant failure rates were higher in agglomerations but this effect was attenuated and, in some cases, reversed in agglomerations with more locally headquartered plants. Moreover, only locally headquartered plants experienced such benefits; remotely headquartered plants failed at higher rates in agglomerations. Although more footwear manufacturing jobs were retained in agglomerations with many locally headquartered plants, such locales also exhibited lower manufacturing job growth in other industries.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} nasopharyngeal bacterial colonisation (NPBC) patterns in young Tanzanian HIV-exposed infants and to analyse the influence of maternal NPBC and of the infant's HIV status on the NPBC pattern. METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study of neonates born to HIV-infected mothers visiting Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Tanzania, between 2005 and 2009. Demographic and clinical data and nasopharyngeal bacterial cultures were obtained {{at the age of}} 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and at one time point, a paired mother-infant nasopharyngeal swab was taken. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-two swabs were taken from 338 eligible infants. At 6 weeks of age, colonisation rates were 66 % for Staphylococcus aureus, 56 % for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 50 % for Moraxella catarrhalis and 14 % for Haemophilus influenzae. Colonisation with S. aureus diminished over time and was more common in HIV-infected <b>infants.</b> <b>S.</b> pneumoniae and H. influenzae colonisation rose over time and was more prevalent in HIV-uninfected children. Co-colonisation of S. pneumoniae with H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis was mostly noticed in HIV-infected <b>infants.</b> <b>S.</b> pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis colonisation of the mother was a risk factor for colonisation in HIV-uninfected <b>infants,</b> while maternal <b>S.</b> aureus colonisation was a risk factor for colonisation in HIV-infected infants.

This includes environmental factors that are currently believed to impact on {{the immune system and}} gut microbiota development. Aim: To assess the associations between early environmental factors (EEF), lymphocyte subsets, and intestinal microbiota composition in infants at familial risk for CD. Study design: Prospective observational study. Subjects: Fifty-five 4 month-old infants with at least a firstdegree relative suffering CD. Infants were classified according to type of delivery, mother's antibiotic intake during pregnancy and during labor, milk-feeding practices, early infections and antibiotic intake, rotavirus vaccine administration, and allergy incidence within the first 18 months of life. Methods: Lymphocyte subsets and gut microbiota composition were studied at the age of 4 months. Results: Formula feeding and infant's infections were associated with higher CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 4 +CD 38 +, CD 4 +CD 28 + and CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RO+ counts (P 0. 01). <b>Infant</b> <b>s</b> infections were also associated with higher CD 4 +CD 25 +, CD 4 +HLA-DR+ and NK cell counts (P 0. 01).

Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing <b>infant</b> cow <b>s</b> milk exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review.

The aim of this work was to study specific species of bacteria in the gut microbiota and relate them to immune function and allergic disease during childhood. In paper I we investigated gut bacteria in feces from infants included in a prospective allergy cohort. We found that children with non-allergic parents {{were more likely to}} be colonized with a group of lactobacilli. Further, lactobacilli colonization was more prevalent in children remaining non-allergic, regardless of allergic heredity. In paper II we related the infant gut bacteria to immune function at two years of age. <b>Infant</b> Staphylococcus (<b>S.)</b> aureus colonization associated with increased immune responsiveness, whereas co-colonization with S. aureus and lactobacilli associated with reduced responses. In paper III we investigated T regulatory (Treg) cell phenotype and cytokine production during childhood, and related S. aureus and lactobacilli colonization to Treg phenotype at the age of two. The Treg population matured with age, regarding phenotype and cytokine production. Furthermore, <b>infant</b> <b>S.</b> aureus colonization associated with Treg phenotype at the age of two. In paper IV we investigated the in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cells responses to soluble factors produced by lactobacilli and S. aureus. Both T- and natural killer cells responded with cytokine production, degranulation and proliferation after S. aureus and simultaneous culture with lactobacilli could dampen the S. aureus-induced responses. Taken together this thesis shows that the gut microbiota is altered in children who develop allergies, and that early life bacteria associate with immune function. Our in vitro findings support that lactobacilli modulate immune maturation and responses, and that early lactobacilli-colonization may be important for a properly regulated maturation of the immune system.

Specifically, the report measures the impact on infant mortality differences of two major factors: the percentage of preterm births and gestational age-specific infant mortality rates. METHODS: Infant mortality and preterm birth data are compared between the United States and European countries. The percent contribution of the two factors to infant mortality differences is computed using the Kitagawa method, with Sweden as the reference country. RESULTS: In 2010, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate was 6. 1 infant deaths per 1, 000 live births, and the United States ranked 26 th in infant mortality among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. After excluding births at less than 24 weeks of gestation to ensure international comparability, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate was 4. 2, still higher than for most European countries and about twice the rates for Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rates for very preterm infants (24 - 31 weeks of gestation) compared favorably with most European rates. However, the U.

The effect of other components of the normal nasal flora on the development of S. aureus carriage was examined in 157 consecutive infants. Negative associations (putative bacterial interference) between S. aureus and other species occurred early in infancy but were not sustained. An increasing antistaphylococcal effect observed over time was not attributable to bacterial interference. S. aureus carriage in infants is likely to be determined by a combination of host, environmental, and bacterial factors, but bacterial interference does not appear to be an ultimate determinant of carrier status...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Broca's century-old {{discovery}} of cerebral asymmetries in language functions, {{there has been}} speculation about the developmental emergence of human perceptual-cognitive asymme-tries. The basic question has been: Do the asymmetries first appear only at some point after birth, starting from an initial state of bilateral equivalence or symmetry at birth, or are the hemispheres instead functionally asymmetrical from the start? A related question is whet. her functional asym-met. ries {{can be traced to}} some lat. eral bias in the structural development of the hemispheres, such t. hat. one hemisphere matures in advance of t. he other. Thus, the term "emergence " in t. he t. itle of this chapt. er might. refer either to functional asymmetries in <b>infant.</b> <b>s</b> or t. o the embryological de-velopment. of t. he hemispheres. An underlying assumpt. ion of this chapter is that t. he ontogeny of functional asymmetries is influenced by an asymmetry in the formation and physical maturat. ion of t. he cerebral hemispheres. Bot. h issues will be addressed in the following discussion, beginning wit. h a review of behavioral evidence for percept. ual-cognitive asymmetries in early infancy, and ending wit. h a proposed model for a lateralizing gradient. in the neuroembryologic emergence of the cerebral hemispheres during prenatal development. As for the development of functional asymmetries, Broca (1865) himself speculated that. lan...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This report {{presents}} 2013 period {{infant mortality}} {{statistics from the}} linked birth/infant death data set (linked file) by maternal and infant characteristics. The linked file differs from the mortality file, which is based entirely on death certificate data. Methods: Descriptive tabulations of data are presented and interpreted. Results: The U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate was 5. 96 infant deaths per 1, 000 live births in 2013, similar to the rate of 5. 98 in 2012. The number of infant deaths was 23, 446 in 2013, a decline of 208 infant deaths from 2012. From 2012 to 2013, infant mortality rates were stable for most race and Hispanic origin groups; declines were reported for two Hispanic subgroups: Cuban and Puerto Rican. Since 2005, the most recent high, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate has declined 13...|$|R
40|$|Objectives-This report {{investigates the}} reasons for the United States' high infant {{mortality}} rate when compared with European countries. Specifically, the report measures the impact on infant mortality differences of two major factors: the percentage of preterm births and gestational age-specific infant mortality rates. Methods-Infant mortality and preterm birth data are compared between the United States and European countries. The percent contribution of the two factors to infant mortality differences is computed using the Kitagawa method, with Sweden as the reference country. Results-In 2010, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate was 6. 1 infant deaths per 1, 000 live births, and the United States ranked 26 th in infant mortality among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. After excluding births at less than 24 weeks of gestation to ensure international comparability, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate was 4. 2, still higher than for most European countries and about twice the rates for Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rates for very preterm infants (24 - 31 weeks of gestation) compared favorably with most European rates. However, the U. S. mortality rate for infants at 32 - 36 weeks was second-highest, and the rate for infants at 37 weeks of gestation or more was highest, among the countries studied. About 39 % of the United States' higher infant mortality rate when compared with that of Sweden was due to a higher percentage of preterm births, while 47 % was due to a higher infant mortality rate at 37 weeks of gestation or more. If the United States could reduce these two factors to Sweden's levels, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>infant</b> mortality rate would fall by 43 %, with nearly 7, 300 infant deaths averted annually.
