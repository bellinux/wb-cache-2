40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and analyze online and offline {{scheduling}} {{models for the}} determination of the maximum power consumption in a smart grid environment. The proposed load models consider that each consumer's residence is equipped with a certain number of appliances of different power demands and different operational times, while the appliances' feature of alternating between ON and OFF states is also incorporated. Each load model is correlated with a scheduling policy that aims to the reduction of the power consumption through the compression of power demands or the postponement of power requests. Furthermore, we associate each load model with a proper dynamic pricing process in order to provide consumers with incentives to contribute to the overall power consumption reduction. The evaluation of the load models through simulation reveals the consistency and the accuracy of the proposed analysis.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{performed}} in the project PANORAMA, co-funded by grants from Belgium, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and the <b>ENIAC</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking.</b> This paper presents an approach to the estimation of depth from stereo images which exploits correspondences of image segments. A key motivation is to bypass pixel correspondences which are ambiguous in texture-less regions. One of the main difficulty though is {{to come up to}} an equivalent partitioning of both stereo images that facilitates region matching. The reference image which the depth is estimated for is first segmented using the watershed algorithm. Regions are then transferred to the other image of the stereo pair according to a correlation analysis of region contours. This transfer yields regional disparities which are significant as long as the contours for a given region are not due to an occlusion. Based on that observation, we propose an algorithm that detects occlusion contours along a region and that rectifies disparity accordingly...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{encryption}} (FE) is {{a powerful}} cryptographic primitive that generalizes many asymmetric encryption systems proposed in recent years. Syntax and security definitions for FE were proposed by Boneh, Sahai, and Waters (BSW) (TCC 2011) and independently by O’Neill (ePrint 2010 / 556). In this paper we revisit these definitions, identify several shortcomings in them, and propose a new definitional approach that overcomes these limitations. Our definitions display good compositionality properties and allow us to obtain new feasibility and impossibility results for adaptive token-extraction attack scenarios that shed further light on the potential reach of general FE for practical applications.
