40|$|<b>International</b> audience: <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> {{and related}} noise {{is a major}} source of {{annoyance}} and impairment to health in urban areas. Many areas exposed to <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> noise are also exposed to rail and air traffic noise. The resulting annoyance may depend on individual/neighborhood socio-demographic factors. Nevertheless, few studies have taken into account the confounding or modifying factors in the relationship between transportation noise and annoyance due to <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b> In this study, we address these issues by combining Geographic Information Systems and epidemiologic methods. Street network buffers with a radius of 500 m were defined around the place of residence of the 7290 participants of the RECORD Cohort in Ile-de-France. Estimated outdoor <b>traffic</b> noise levels (<b>road,</b> rail, and air separately) were assessed at each place of residence and in each of these buffers. Higher levels of exposure to noise were documented in low educated neighborhoods. Multilevel logistic regression models documented positive associations between <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> noise and annoyance due to <b>road</b> <b>traffic,</b> after adjusting for individual / neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. There was no evidence that the association was of different magnitude when noise was measured at the place of residence or in the residential neighborhood. However, the strength of the association between neighborhood noise exposure and annoyance increased when considering a higher percentile in the distribution of noise in each neighborhood. <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> noise estimated at the place of residence and <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> noise in the residential neighborhood (75 th percentile) were independently associated with annoyance, when adjusted for each other. Interactions of effects indicated that the relationship between <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> noise exposure in the residential neighborhood and annoyance was stronger in affluent and high educated neighborhoods. Overall, our findings suggest that it is useful to take into account (i) the exposure to transportation noise in the residential neighborhood rather than only at the residence, (ii) different percentiles of noise exposure in the residential neighborhood, and (iii) the socioeconomic characteristics of the residential neighborhood to explain variations in annoyance due to <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> in the neighborhood...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> Act 1988 gives {{police in}} the United Kingdom the power to seize motor {{vehicles}} which they have reasonable grounds for believing are being driven without a valid driver's licence or motor insurance. Drivers may then {{have to pay a}} fee to have their vehicles returned. When exercising this power of seizure, the police may rely on information contained on the Police National Computer (PNC) which is linked to the National Insurance Database (NID). Whilst these databases are undoubtedly invaluable in this endeavour, they are not always accurate, and incidents have occurred whereby motorists who are in fact driving with valid insurance have had their vehicles seized and retained. Focusing on the case of Lisa, whose vehicle was wrongly impounded by Merseyside Police in 2007, and other cases, we explore the legitimacy and legality of such activity. We question both the discretionary power of the police in taking such action, and the validity of their (over) reliance on technology. We posit that the taking of money in cases such as Lisa's is evidence of the turn within public policing towards marketisation, and consider the capacity for harm to innocent individuals and the implications for justice and fairness. Ultimately, we contend that police accountability is compromised and that a new approach is required. We close the piece with some recommendations for improved police practice...|$|R

30|$|Aggregate fatality, {{population}} and vehicle data from European countries between 1970 and 2002 {{have been used}}. Data for years 1970 – 1994 {{have been used for}} the model estimation and years 1995 – 2002 have been used for validation. Choosing different splits for the data set (e.g. setting aside fewer or more data for the validation) might lead to different results.

The data have been obtained primarily from IRTAD (<b>International</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> and Accident Database). Official representatives of the countries with missing data were contacted directly, and several responses with additional data were incorporated to the database. In the end, out of the 25 countries of the enlarged EU, sufficiently complete data have been available for 16 of them, for which this model has been applied. Fatalities data refer to the 30 -day definition of fatality for all countries, i.e. include all persons who died within 30  days of being involved in a traffic accident. The timeframe used in this research was decided during the Safety-Net project in 2006, when this work initiated [34]. The presented models are general and could be applied to newer data.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{interest}} in the comparison of road safety developments in different countries. Comparisons have been made, based on absolute levels of accident or fatality risk or on {{the rate of change}} of functions regarding risk, the number of accidents, fatalities or injuries over time. Such comparisons are mostly based on single parameters. The method described here goes into more detail regarding similarities and dissimilarities of such developments, using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique. A first analysis was carried out on the number of fatalities in 24 countries (mainly European) over 28 years (1970 through 1997). The data was taken from the <b>International</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> and Accident Database (IRTAD), initiated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The year 1970 is the starting year; from this year onwards, annual data is available for a large number of countries. The analysis showed that most of the similarities and dissimilarities are represented by four dimensions. There {{turned out to be one}} major common trend describing the general decrease of the number of fatalities over time from the starting year 1970 onwards. It is well known that before 1970 the number of fatalities increased in many countries and decreased shortly afterwards. However, this trend cannot be shown because data from the period before 1970 is missing. For Greece, Korea, Spain and Portugal the trend is on average increasing instead of decreasing, in particular for Greece and Korea. In all other countries there is a decreasing trend, generally at the same level, except for New Zealand. Here the decrease is less marked than in most Western countries. On all four dimensions the similarities between the European countries were large, compared with non-European countries, except for Greece, Spain, Portugal, Hungary and the Czech Republic and to a minor extent for Ireland. Within the cluster of European countries sub-clusters may be distinguished. The developments in Germany and the Netherlands are for instance rather similar, and the same goes for Belgium, France, Switzerland and Austria. This suggests that, apart from economic developments, geographical and cultural factors are also important. The analysis is only applied to the total number of fatalities. The same procedure could be used to compare the fatality rates for countries for which traffic volume developments are known. Such analyses might help to understand the major factors that affect safety for countries in general...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) With the {{increasing}} number of vehicles on the road, the demand for advanced traffic control systems is on the rise. In future, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is envisaged to be a key component of the road traffic management system. To maximize the efficiency of the traffic control system, various ITS applications could be used along with the existing control methods by integrating communications, computing and electronic technologies. A new wireless networking standard known as the IEEE 802. 11 p has been exclusively developed for the VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) based next generation transportation systems. The IEEE 802. 11 p standard can support both V 2 V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V 2 I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) communications mode. For a VANET based ITS, the V 2 I mode can be used for exchanging signals between traffic control entities and vehicles. The aim of this research is to utilize a V 2 I communication architecture to accommodate and integrate two novel applications of an advanced ITS, namely the IRTSS (Intelligent Road Traffic Signalling System) and the PRTMS (Predictive Road Traffic Signalling System). A novel IRTSS has been proposed and implemented using the V 2 I based VANET architecture to control traffic flow both at isolated and coordinated road intersections. Furthermore, a basic Predictive Road Traffic Management System (PRTMS) has been developed and integrated with the VANET architecture to achieve multi-junction traffic flow control. An OPNET based integrated simulation model has been developed that jointly examines the performance of the proposed road traffic management system and the communications network. A realistic road traffic flow has been embedded in the simulation model that complies with the <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> control standards proposed by Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, AsutRoads and United States Department of Transportation (U. S. DoT). Both proposed ITS applications are based on the VANET architecture which could be implemented for a city size road network. The proposed vehicle detection system is relatively advanced compared to the existing sensor based detection systems. The thesis presents a unique co-simulation model that incorporates both road infrastructure, controlled vehicle mobility and a model of a VANET network. Simulation results are analysed to characterise the VANET based IRTSS and PRTMS systems for a wide area traffic control system. The results indicate that the proposed architecture can efficiently detect and control traffic flows in a large road network with minimum hardware/software resources compared to the existing vehicle detection methods...|$|E
