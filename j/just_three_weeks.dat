5|$|In August 1808, Wellesley {{entered the}} Peninsular War, landing at Mondego Bay, north of Lisbon, with 13,000–15,000 men. <b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after landing, Wellesley {{defeated}} the French at the Battle of Vimeiro. Aware of his weak position, French général de division (divisional general) Junot {{called for an}} armistice and negotiations began which lead to the Convention of Cintra and his army's withdrawal from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E

Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting. <b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the film's release, Hamilton and a small team, which included Broccoli's stepson and future producer Michael G.

5|$|Saban was {{selected}} in the 10th round of the 1944 NFL Draft by Card-Pitt, a temporary merger between the Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers made necessary after the teams were gutted by players' military service. Saban, however, did not sign with Card-Pitt, and instead joined the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and coached by Paul Brown. Brown said Saban would be used exclusively on defense as a linebacker and as a kicker of extra points. Saban {{was one of the}} first arrivals at the Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio, having left China <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War gave Finland {{a window of opportunity}} to achieve this. The Finns sought aid from both the German Empire and the Bolsheviks to that end, and on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the country's independence. The new Bolshevik Russian government was weak, and soon the Russian Civil War would break out. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin could spare no troops or attention for Finland, and consequently, Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the declaration of independence. In 1918, the Finns fought a short civil war, where the pro-Bolshevik Red Guards were armed by 7,000 to 10,000 Russian troops stationed in Finland.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Norman Alexander spent time in both Singapore and New Zealand, whilst Elizabeth Alexander {{returned}} to England. In 1947, when the children {{were old enough to}} attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took on the role of Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in Agronomy, soil science, and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. <b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2000s, the band {{continued}} to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members—bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton—to join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together $6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with the Get Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album in ten days, which was stressful, and Rose would frustrate the band with insults in order to record better. Initial copies of the band's debut, I Am the Movie, were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold {{out of the back of}} their tour van for a year.|$|E
5|$|Undrafted out of college, Breslin {{signed with}} the Los Angeles Kings as a free agent. He {{attended}} Kings training camp, where he played with his professional hockey hero, Wayne Gretzky. Breslin {{failed to make the}} team and Los Angeles assigned him to their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate the Phoenix Roadrunners. In his first season with Phoenix, Breslin broke his arm early in the season. He returned to play <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the injury, but eventually re-broke the arm and missed the remainder of the season. He finished his first professional season playing in 45 games, scoring 8 goals and 29 points. In the 1992–93 season Breslin improved his production to 14 goals and a career-high 44 points. Phoenix finished the season with a league-low 26 wins and 58 points. He began his third professional season with the Roadrunners, but after five games he was reassigned to the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays. Breslin played nine games for the Stingrays, registering six points, before being recalled by Phoenix. Finishing the year with the Roadrunners, he registered 9 goals and 27 points in 50 games. Phoenix improved to 85 points but failed to make the playoffs for the third straight year. At the conclusion of the season, Breslin's contract with the Kings expired.|$|E

5|$|Conditions were {{favorable}} for the nascent depression to strengthen. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted {{the system would}} become a Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale when the system was only a tropical depression. Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 season. The storm very quickly organized, developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection; this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear. On August23, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status, and an eye began forming later that day. On the next day, as the storm rapidly intensified, the eye became much more distinct and {{was surrounded by a}} powerful eyewall. During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00UTC on August24, Marie attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, the first such Pacific hurricane since Celia in 2010. The NHC estimated peak sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h), based on a Dvorak T-number of 7.0 provided by TAFB and SAB. They also estimated Marie's minimum barometric pressure at 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), ranking as the seventh-strongest in the Pacific east of the International Date Line since records began in 1949. Coincidentally, Hurricane Odile attained the same pressure <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> later. At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575mi (925km) across.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Dunkirk, many Allied {{ships were}} lost to Ju 87 attacks as the British Operation Dynamo sought to {{evacuate}} British and French armies from the pocket. The French destroyer Adroit was sunk on 21 May 1940, {{followed by the}} paddle steamer Crested Eagle on 28 May. The French Channel-steamer Côte d'Arzur (3,047) followed. The Ju 87s operated to maximum effectiveness when the weather allowed. RAF fighter units were held back and Allied air cover was patchy at best. On 29 May the Royal Navy destroyer H.M.S.Grenade was severely damaged by a JU 87 attack within Dunkirk's harbour, and subsequently sank. The French destroyer Mistral was crippled by bomb damage the same day. Jaguar and Verity were badly damaged while the trawlers Calvi and Polly Johnson (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. The merchant ship Fenella (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. The attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. The rail ships Lorina and Normannia (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also. By 29 May, the Allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged. On 1 June the Ju 87s sank the Skipjack (815 tons) while the destroyer Keith was sunk and Basilisk was crippled before being scuttled by Whitehall. Whitehall was later badly damaged and along with Ivanhoe, staggered back to Dover. Havant, commissioned for <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> was sunk and in the evening the French destroyer Foudroyant sank after a mass-attack. Further victories against shipping were claimed before nightfall on 1 June. The steamer Pavon was lost while carrying 1,500 Dutch soldiers {{most of whom were}} killed. The oil tanker Niger was also destroyed. A flotilla of French minesweepers were also lost—Denis Papin (264 tons), the Le Moussaillon (380 tons) and Venus (264 tons).|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Eastwood {{was cast}} as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series Rawhide, the {{breakthrough}} {{in his career}} he had long been searching for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona {{in the summer of}} 1958. It took <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The Rawhide years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled {{in the middle of the}} 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of Rawhides cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.|$|E
