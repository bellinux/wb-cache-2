5000|$|<b>Isoetarine</b> is a {{selective}} short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonist. It {{can be called}} the [...] "granddaughter of adrenalin" [...] {{in the line of}} β2 agonists that gave quick relief for bronchospasm and asthma. Epinephrine (adrenalin) was the first of these, and next came isoprenaline (isoproterenol). Isoetharine was the third drug in this line, thus the third generation or granddaughter of the original.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s isoetharine was largely {{replaced}} {{in the marketplace}} by orciprenaline (metaproterenol), which seemed to have slightly less cardiac side effect and lasted {{a couple of hours}} longer. Orciprenaline in turn was replaced by salbutamol (albuterol). Some practitioners still believe that these later aerosolized bronchodilators never gave quite as quick of relief from asthmatic shortness of breath as did <b>isoetarine.</b> Thus they see a continued specialty role in treatment of severe shortness of breath that does not improve in the first five minutes of salbutamol treatment.|$|E
5000|$|All of {{the early}} β2 agonist catecholamines used for {{bronchospasm}} had strong side effects, with increase in heart rate as {{the most common and}} most problematic. This came because its [...] "β2 effect" [...] was not quite as selective as might be hoped. β1 receptors appeared to also be stimulated in some patients, causing cardiac and other CNS side effects. With <b>isoetarine</b> this effect tended to be transient and usually went away within a matter of minutes {{after the end of the}} treatment. Increase in blood pressure also occurred in a small but significant percentage of cases, but also was almost invariably transient.|$|E
