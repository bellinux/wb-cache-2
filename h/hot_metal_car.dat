40|$|The {{steel mills}} in Bethlehem are quiet now, but Mildred T. Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s boldly colored {{needlepoint}} tapestries vividly {{remind us of}} their awesome power in the 1940 s and 1950 s. Far from being realistic, literal renderings, these abstract and highly textural interpretations use steel making {{as a metaphor for}} modern life. The machinery is larger than life, crackling and spewing out the molten steel used to construct oilrigs and skyscrapers. The people in the mill are very small—the anonymous steelworkers in masks, the artist as a bewildered Alice in a Wonderland of Steel. Mildred Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s needlepoints are personal and spiritual. Her Buddha rising above the blast furnace signals that no matter how deafening the machinery, spiritual beliefs can prevail, bestowing a semblance of calm in a fast-paced, dehumanized world. Mildred Johnstone received her artistic training from a variety of sources. In the early 1940 s, she studied painting at the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia. Although she liked painting, she soon realized that her busy lifestyle did not lend itself to oil painting. Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s second husband, William H. Johnstone, was {{vice president in charge of}} financial and legal matters at Bethlehem Steel. Consequently, the Johnstones spent a great deal of time traveling within the United States and abroad on Bethlehem Steel business. In the 1930 s and early 1940 s, Milly (as she was known) created small decorative embroideries—monogrammed towels, ecclesiastical embroideries, and a wall hanging based on a Pennsylvania-German design. These needlework projects, a hesitant first step in finding her artistic medium, kept her fingers busy during her travels, but they did not satisfy her aesthetic curiosity. The turning point in Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s artistic career came in 1948 when, on the invitation of her husband, she became the first woman to tour the Bethlehem Steel works. Awed by the power and grandeur of the place, she envisioned herself as Alice in Wonderland, growing smaller and smaller. When asked which elements of steel making she most responded to she stated: 2 ̆ 2 That is difficult to say. What you call the elements are something to be felt, not itemized. Perhaps one will be a giant hook silhouetted against the sky; another a <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> <b>car.</b> Or I may stop and photograph the web like tracery of a catwalk atop a blast furnace. 2 ̆ 21 These visits provided Johnstone with the inspiration and material she needed for her needlepoint series on the theme of steel making...|$|E

The Japanese did not provide the prisoners with medical care, so U.S. medical personnel tended to the sick and wounded with few or no supplies. Upon arrival at the San Fernando railhead, prisoners were stuffed into sweltering, brutally <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> box <b>cars</b> for the one-hour trip to Capas, in 110 F heat. At least 100 prisoners were pushed into each of the trains' unventilated boxcars. The trains had no sanitation facilities, and disease continued to take a heavy toll on the prisoners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of the relationships between input variables and silicon's behaviour in BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla No. 5 Blast Furnace. Over a period of 13 years stretching from 1991 to 2004, potentially important variables affecting the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon content of the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> produced in the furnace were collected on a daily basis. A process analysis was performed using the data mining program, 'Weka', which is a freeware program developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand. The data collected were altered, and different datasets compiled, in order to analyse the data without interferences and to reveal previously unknown and hidden relationships. A post-pulverized coal injection dataset was compiled to remove historical variations of limited relevance to current operations. An important variable affecting the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon was found to be the amount of Quartz charged in to the furnace. After finding the importance of Quartz charge, a short term, high frequency dataset was collected and analysed to find the true correlations. Quartz is charged in to the furnace to change the slag basicity, but this project shows that a significant fraction of the Quartz transfers into the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> as silicon instead of transferring in to the slag as silica as intended. The original data was compiled into a day-to-day difference dataset where each instance contained a difference between two consecutive days. In the difference dataset analysis, the long term variation was removed and the impacts of operational variables on <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon were revealed. The most significant variable affecting <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon was <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon was corrected by <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> temperature and the analysis was continued. The analysis showed that the relationship between <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> sulphur and <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon was not causal, and could be explained by the impact of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> temperature. A data mining framework brought valuable new insight into <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> silicon control in the blast furnace and further effort in this area is strongly recommended.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} hearth operation and the factors influencing the total quality of <b>hot</b> <b>metal,</b> especially its carbon and sulphur contents. Regarding the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> quality there are many sources of disturbances starting from raw materials, continuing through the blast furnace process and ending the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> casting. The carbon content of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> {{is an important part of}} the total quality of <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> Nearly 80  % of the total reaction energy in the BOF process comes from the oxidation of carbon in <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> Therefore, a high and stable carbon content of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> is most beneficial. Sulphur in <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> is known to retard the carbonisation of <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> The sulphur content in <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> is controlled by the sulphur load in the coke and other fuels as well as the slag basicity and low level of unreduced iron oxides. Both carbonisation and desulphurisation are strongly dependent on the hearth operation. To secure a proper hearth operation the hearth coke, the deadman should neither be clogged nor get inactive. Good hearth operation prolongs the campaign life of the hearth lining improving thus the total economy. In this work the factors influencing the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> carbon content have been investigated. The carbonisation of solid iron starts in the shaft by CO gas and also by coke carbon when the <b>metal</b> melts down. <b>Hot</b> <b>metal</b> does not get saturated with carbon. The difference between the saturation and actual carbon contents was observed to be around 0. 7  % in average and it increases with increasing sulphur content. The carbon content of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> can be maintained on a high level by keeping the sulphur content of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> below 0. 05  % which can be attained with a sufficient slag basicity, e. g. CaO / SiO =  1. 2. A progressive vicious circle in blast furnace operation was observed. Problems may start with some disturbance in the hearth operation gradually resulting in low permeability or total clogging of the deadman. The raceways become shorter which leads to a hanging cohesive zone. A hanging cohesive zone transfers insufficiently reduced iron oxides into the slag. Desulphurisation of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> weakens due to a higher FeO content in the slag. A high sulphur content in <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> promotes the precipitation of calcium sulphide. Calcium sulphide together with other compounds with high melting point may clog the hearth further. There are several factors which strengthen vicious circle like a low heat level, an overfilled hearth, too acid slag etc. Different factors influencing the hearth phenomena and start up of the vicious circle including CaS precipitation were observed and analysed in this work. Early warning symptoms of a clogged hearth and methods to identify an inactive deadman were collected. Measures to cure an inactive deadman were developed and practised as well. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> pretreatment had tremendous improvements in past decades and was widely {{used by the}} overwhelming majority of steelworks in Japan. While, since the first <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> pretreatment station was established in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd in the later period of 1980 s, this process began to be applied in domestic steel plants. And now 30 years have passed, the desilionization and dephosphorization process are still rarely seldom used in China except desulphurization process in most carbon steel plants. So in this paper, the metallurgical principles and effects of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> desiliconization were analyzed in great details. Meanwhile, the optimum silicon content of <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> between iron-making and steelmaking process was summarized and calculated.

The solubility of titanium in molten iron was calculated with thermodynamic and relationship between solublity and temperature was disscused. The results show molten iron becomes viscous mainly controlled by the dissolution and precipitation of titanium. [Si] has a weakening effect on the solubility of titanium.

40|$|Production of low silicon <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> is an {{essential}} part of successful treatment of vanadium containing titania-magnetite ore in blast furnace. The formation of titanium carbides and titanium nitrides very much depends on solubility of titanium in <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> The analysis showed that with reduction in silicon content the content of titanium in <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> is also reduced. Similarity in silicon and titanium reduction allows usage of the same factors to control content of these elements in <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> Increase in furnace pressure reduces silicon and titanium content in <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> and first of all titanium-carbide formation. At actual blast furnace conditions the content of titanium carbides is far from equilibrium and materials residence time is an important control parameter. Increase in coke strength after reaction (CSR) improves permeability of coke packing and accelerates filtration of the melt, suppressing titanium-carbides formation. Increase in hearth's height to width ratio with the same hearth's volume also positively affects operation of blast furnace. Uniform descent of pellets and sinter, and uniform distribution of limestone in furnace cross-section stabilize the heat transfer conditions further suppressing formation of titanium-carbides. The practical measures to retard titanium-carbides formation and to produce high quality low silicon and low titanium <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> are proposed and implemented at Nizgniy Tagil I & S Works in Russia (NTMK) with increase in blast furnace specific productivity up to 3. 5 thm/m 3 /day...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine and compare <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> and cold type production of display advertising for newspapers. The classical <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> system uses a lead alloy as its basic building material while modern cold type production uses photographic means. Some advantages of using cold type are the improved quality of the final product, increased versatility in ad composition, possibilities for major labor savings, the lower skills required for the compositor and less production space required for the machinery. Some disadvantages of cold type production are the major investment required for new equipment, higher materials costs, difficulty in producing proofs, labor relations and retraining difficulties, and the durability of the press plates. The data for the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> method consisted of a sample of 195 ads. The eight major operations studied were Markup Time, Type Slips Time, Stereotype Time, Typesetting Time, Composing Time, Proof Pulling Time, and Correction Time. Thirty-seven factors, such as {{the size of the}} ad and the number of lines of type, were hypothesized to effect the operation times. These operation times and factors were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis to formulate a mathematical model of the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> system. For this cold type system, circumstances prevented making a complete model but data for a sample of 15 ads was collected. The data for the sample of cold type ads was used in the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> regression model to determine comparable times for production of the ads by both systems. Experimental results showed that it would take three times as long to compose the ads by <b>hot</b> <b>metal.</b> When combined labor and materials costs are considered, <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> costs 1. 6 to 2. 8 times as much as cold type depending on the wage rates considered and the relative productive efficiency of both plants. Administrative and most overhead costs were considered to remain constant no matter what production system was used. The depreciation rate for the cold type operations is 3. 06 times that of the <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> system studied. Recommendations for further study include: 1. Reevaluate <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> regression model using transformations in order to reduce non-linearities. 2. Reformulate the cold type system so that equivalent production work can be measured to produce a cold type regression model. 3. Extend the study of cold type and <b>hot</b> <b>metal</b> into news and classified production. 4, Use the complex regression models to determine major variables so that simplified models could easily be prepared by any interested newspaper. 5, Determine realistic cost comparisons including the effects of unequal depreciation rates, taxes, and interest. 6.
