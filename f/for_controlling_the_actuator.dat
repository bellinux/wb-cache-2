The device to be controlled is a piezoelectric flexible mechanism dedicated to micromanipulation. It has been previously designed with an emphasis to control strategy, using a new topological optimization method, by considering innovative frequency-based criteria. A complete non-linear model relating the voltage and the resulting deflection is established taking into account hysteresis as a plurilinear model subjected to uncertainties. The approach used <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> tip {{is based on a}} mixed High Authority Control (HAC) / Low Authority Control (LAC) strategy for designing a wide-band regulator. It consists of a Positive Position Feedback (PPF) damping controller approach combined with a low-frequency integral controller which is shown to have robustness performances as good as a RST-based robust pole placement approach for the microgripper. The rejection of the vibrations, naturally induced by the flexible structure, and the control of the tip displacement have been successfully performed. Because we had taken into account frequency-based criteria from the first designing step of our device, we demonstrate that the tuning of the HAC/LAC can be easily performed and leads to low regulator order...|$|E

Current systems are designed to operate in deepwater with relatively short step-outs. Since the search now is starting to exceed this, the operational conditions are changed and the electro-hydraulic system is closing in on its operational limits. Hence, the increasing need for a system that supports the long step-outs and the deeper water. Aker Kvaerner has started looking into the development for an All Electric Subsea Production system. In co-operation with Aker Kvaerner Subsea, a functional design specification for an electric subsea gate valve actuator has been developed and included in this thesis. This functional design specification will include all the requirements that a subsea electric actuator must conform to. This includes the operational requirements, size limitations, failsafe needs etc. Based on this specification, a design for a electric actuator and including motor driver control system layout on the all electric x-mas tree is proposed {{as a part of the}} All Electric Subsea Production system. <b>The</b> <b>actuator</b> will be used to operate the gate valves on a x-mas tree which <b>controls</b> <b>the</b> flow of hydrocarbons through the valves into the pipelines. Most of the existing subsea gate valve actuators are currently using hydraulic oil to operate the valves linearly. Here a concept is being suggested in replacement of the hydraulic fluid, while still complying with the necessary design specification. A number of electrical machines for potential use in this application are presented and evaluated. A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine is being investigated further. These machines can be custom made, and can also be made with built in redundancy. Calculation of size for the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine has been done, to determine suitability within the space limitation of the apparatus.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Future railway trends require travelling at high speeds without deterioration in the ride quality, but further improvement of the ride quality by optimisation of the passive suspension components has reached its limits. This suggests that active suspensions should be used. Rigorous studies {{over the past four}} decades have shown that this technique is able to overcome the passive suspension limitation in terms of improving the overall ride performance of the railway vehicle with the incorporation of additional active elements i. e. actuators, sensors and processors. The work in this thesis investigates a novel method <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>actuators</b> within <b>the</b> suspension system, something which has been neglected in previous studies. It is a particular problem because at higher frequencies, when the suspension is providing isolation of the car body from the track irregularities, <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> must accommodate <b>the</b> suspension movements whilst producing very small forces, otherwise the ride quality substantially deteriorates. Instead of considering more complex active suspension control strategies, which tend to be complex and may be impractical, the performance of <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> across <b>the</b> secondary suspension is investigated. This research looks into improving actuator technologies for railway secondary suspensions in order to achieve the full benefits of active control. This thesis explores novel methods to improve the ride quality of the railway vehicle through secondary suspension actuator and controller design, with the ultimate aim of integrating this technology into a fully active railway vehicle. The focus of this active suspension research is therefore upon incorporating real actuator technology, instead of the usual assumption of ideal actuators. For meaningful and reliable research a simple, well established active control strategy is used for assessment to highlight the degradation in the suspension performance compared with <b>the</b> ideal <b>actuators.</b> Preliminary investigation demonstrates significant degradation of the ride quality caused by real <b>actuators</b> in <b>the</b> secondary suspension, and this research looks at methods to reduce this effect. Including actuators within a secondary suspension system is a difficult actuator problem compared to the normal application of actuators such as position control. This is because <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> controller design process requires the consideration of the interaction of the vehicle suspension. <b>The</b> <b>actuators</b> that have been identified as suitable for the application are the electromechanical and servo-hydraulic types, and these are incorporated across the secondary suspension. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> dynamics have been analysed. Practical classical controllers are used to provide force-feedback control of both types of <b>actuator</b> in <b>the</b> secondary suspension. A variety of actuator control techniques are considered including: optimisation of <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> controller parameters to solve the multi-objective and multivariable problem, the introduction of feed forward techniques and the use of optimal control approaches...|$|R

This paper describes {{the use of a}} tubular DEAP actuator for active vibration isolation. First, the quasi-static and dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> are discussed. These involve the voltage-strain-force behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>actuator.</b> It is seen that <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> is inherently non-linear, involving an approximately quadratic relationship between excitation and extension under given loading conditions. In a control context, this can be compensated for either by driving <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> about some d. c. off-set excitation in a quasi-linear manner, or by including a linearization component within <b>the</b> <b>control.</b> Next, issues concerning the frequency response over a wide range of frequency are considered. Internal resonances exist in <b>the</b> <b>actuator,</b> which limit <b>the</b> bandwidth over which it can be used <b>for</b> active <b>control.</b> <b>The</b> <b>actuator</b> has significant internal damping. The potential for active vibration isolation is then explored. The dynamic performance is limited by the potential bandwidth, the maximum force that can be generated and the maximum range of movement, together with the inherent nonlinearity. Performance for harmonic disturbances is investigated within an adaptive feedforward control scheme. Experimental results are presented. Good attenuation of the excitation frequency is achieved but compensation is required to get good attenuation of higher harmonics introduced by <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> nonlinearity.

40|$|Physical {{exercise}} is challenging {{for individuals who}} are blind because they lack the spatial awareness necessary to imitate described motions for exercises, and additionally require physical guidance. The current solutions involve tactile equipment to assist in body placement, but a person with low vision cannot compare their own position to the correct position and adjust properly. The proposed solution is an instructional yoga program that will give feedback to the user based on her exercise performance, allowing {{people who are blind}} to be able to perform these exercises independently at home. The design will incorporate the Skeletal Tracking program of the Microsoft Kinect, which uses infrared waves to determine 3 D positions of twenty points on the body relative to one another. The program will use these points to determine the relative anatomical joint angles and relate them to the angles that correspond to the yoga positions. It will determine for each limb segment what motion is needed to match the desired yoga position. The user will then receive vibratory feedback on the portion of the limb in the direction in which it must move. There will be four vibrators each on the humerus and femur, one each for flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, and two each on the forearm and lower leg, one for flexion and one for extension. Because only one of the vibrators corresponding to opposing motion will be on at a time, there are twelve channels of communication, each with three different positions (0 : both off, 1 : one on, - 1 : other on). Each limb will be adjusted and given feedback separately before the user holds the pose. A microcontroller will be programmed to activate the appropriate vibrator based on data sent wirelessly from the computer. The vibrators will be attached to compression sleeves, so their positioning is constant and in contact with the skin. Our progress includes designing the software concept and program outline as well as determining the hardware needed to provide feedback including a parts list. We also chose yoga poses that we expect to be detectable by the Kinect, and vibrators that are compatible both with our hardware and the sensitivity of the mechanoreceptors.

A principal feature of the paper is the development of model-based sensorless <b>control</b> methodologies <b>for</b> driving PMSMs using matrix converters. In particular, it is shown that observer-based state estimation techniques normally employed <b>for</b> sensorless <b>control</b> of PMSMs using voltage source inverters, can be readily exported to matrix converter counterparts with minimal additional computational overhead. Experimental results from a 0. 7 kW PMSM driven by a matrix converter, suitable for a subsea actuator pump, are included to demonstrate the ability of the sensorless techniques to provide reliable estimates of machine rotor position under transient load conditions, and the subsequent exploitation for matrix converter/motor combinations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} two new lost cost, electronically controlled {{fuel metering}} systems for small gas turbine engines, particularly applicable in remotely piloted vehicles. The first one incorporates a diaphragm operated flat-seat bypass valve {{to maintain a}} constant differential pressure across the metering valve, which is actuated by a digital linear <b>actuator.</b> In <b>the</b> second one, both the metering and the bypass valves are controlled by two independently operated digital linear <b>actuators.</b> <b>The</b> mathematical models for the first fuel metering system, were created and used for computer simulation. Next, after preparing the experimental test set-up, the manufactured prototype was tested and the models for both the steady state and the dynamic response were validated. Three design optimization criteria, fuel flow linearity, low sensitivity to the design parameters changes and fast dynamic response were examined to improve {{the performance of the}} proposed fuel metering system. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique was developed and implemented to obtain the best design parameters of the system. For the second fuel metering system, first the mathematical models for both the steady state and dynamic response were developed. Next, due to the flexibility offered by this system, different <b>control</b> strategies <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> digital linear <b>actuators</b> during <b>the</b> normal operation mode of <b>the</b> <b>actuators</b> and also during the back-up operation modes were introduced and investigated. Finally, to investigate the impact of different <b>control</b> strategies on <b>the</b> dynamic response of the engine, a dynamic model for the engine was also developed and used. At the end, four available fuel metering systems, including the two new ones, were compared regarding their deviation from the fuel flow linearity, dynamic response and the cost...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of non-model-based {{position}} regulation for the dynamic compensation robotic system (DCRS), which has been proposed for cooperating with the existing main robotic systems, such as the common serial robotic arms, to accomplish high-speed and accurate manipulations. The dynamic compensation concept is realized by fusing a high-speed & light-weight compensation actuator as well as endpoint closed loop (ECL) configured high-speed cameras. Within the context of the DCRS, the coarse motion, which is realized by the main robotic system, usually gives rise to negative dynamic impact on <b>the</b> compensation <b>actuator</b> that is configured to accomplish the fine motion. Through the analysis of a simplified model for the coupled two-plant system, relative velocity information between the two plants is found {{to play a role in}} the first order derivative of the displacement error. With the use of the relative position information from high-speed visual feedback, this paper proposes a new pre-compensation fuzzy logic <b>control</b> (PFLC) approach <b>for</b> <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> compensation <b>actuator.</b> <b>The</b> PFLC method is model-independent and is realized with a cascade fuzzy inference structure that conveniently integrates the relative velocity term between the two plants into the error regulation, and therefore realizes the partial counteraction of the disturbance from the main robot easily without knowing the explicit mathematical models of the system. Comparison works between the proposed PFLC and approaches that take no consideration of the relative velocity information, such as proportional-derivative (PD) control and conventional fuzzy logic control, are conducted. Simulations and experiments show the consistent effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this video}} the walking robot âDribbelâ is presented, {{which has been}} built at <b>the</b> <b>Control</b> Engineering group of the University of Twente, the Netherlands. This robot has been {{designed}} {{with a focus on}} minimal energy consumption, using a passive dynamic approach. It is a so-called four-legged 2 D walker; the use of four legs prevents it from falling sideways. During the design phase extensive use has been made of 20 -sim. This power port based modeling package was used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the robot in order to estimate the design parameters for the prototype. The parameters obtained by the simulation were then used as a basis for the real robot. The real robot is made of aluminum and weighs 9. 5 kg. Each of the nine joints (one hip, four knees, four feet) has a dedicated electronic driver board for interfacing the joint sensors. For walking a simple control loop is used: when the front feet touch the ground, the rear legs are swung forward. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> parameters can be adjusted online using a serial link. Using this simple <b>control</b> loop, <b>the</b> robot walks at a speed of 1. 2 km/h and a step frequency of 1. 1 Hz. <b>The</b> hip <b>actuator</b> consumes 6. 7 W. The walking behaviour of the robot is very similar to the simulation, regarding both walking motion and power consumption. With the serial link real time data acquisition in the simulation package (running on the PC) is possible. This allows for advanced verification and fine tuning of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. <b>The</b> simulation package can also be used directly within <b>the</b> <b>control</b> loop. Future research is planned on energy based <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> walking motion, using impedance <b>control</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hip <b>actuator</b> and design of more advanced (and actuated) foot shapes...|$|R
40|$|Testing {{platform}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{study of}} <b>control</b> systems <b>The</b> following final project consists {{in the study}} and elaboration of a testing platform <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of <b>control</b> systems. We will have to build a real system to control {{that will allow us to}} take real-time empirical data if necessary for their characterization. Specifically, the system that has been designed by the project is a rocker prototype with an engine and a helix. The studied plant is based on a bar that has the freedom to rotate around a horizontal axis that describes a movement that is contained in the vertical plane. This is achieved thanks to the lifting force that generates the helix in a viscous fluid such as air. The helix is connected to a DC motor and both are embedded at one end of the moving bar. By varying the speed of rotation of the helix, it is possible to vary the force it generates and, consequently, the angle that forms the position of the bar relative to the vertical. You can measure the position or the angle with a potentiometer coupled to the axis of rotation that depending on the resistance that generates, the passage of the current will be related to a specific angle. Next, the integration of data and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> system is carried out in the simulation environment of the Labview program. In this, a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control is designed to be tuned and will allow <b>control</b> <b>the</b> motor's rotation speed and use the angle measurement to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> position of the system. As an interconnection platform between the system and the PC, an Arduino UNO microcontroller has been used with the extension of LINX Makerhub and a motor driver <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> <b>actuator.</b> A theoretical study of the real plant will be carried out to create a mathematical model that emulates the behavior of the real system. Once you have it, a simulated plant module is created in the programming environment with which you can tune in the controller. The values of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> variables obtained with the tuning of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> system based on the simulated and the real plant are compared...|$|R
40|$|Monkeys {{can learn}} to {{directly}} <b>control</b> <b>the</b> movements of an artificial actuator by using a brainâmachine interface (BMI) driven by the activity of a sample of cortical neurons. Eventually, they can do so without moving their limbs. Neuronal adaptations underlying <b>the</b> transition from <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> limb to <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> are poorly understood. Here, we show that rapidmodifications in neuronal representation of velocity of <b>the</b> hand and <b>actuator</b> occur in multiple cortical areas during the operation of a BMI. Initially, monkeys <b>controlled</b> <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> by moving a hand-held pole. During this period, the BMI was trained to predict <b>the</b> <b>actuator</b> velocity. As <b>the</b> monkeys started using their cortical activity to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> <b>actuator,</b> <b>the</b> activity of individual neurons and neuronal populations became less representative of the animalâs handmovements while representing themovements of <b>the</b> <b>actuator.</b> As {{a result of this}} adaptation, the animals could eventually stop moving their hands yet continue to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> <b>actuator.</b> These results show that, during BMI control, cortical ensembles represent behaviorally significantmotor parameters, even if these are not associated withmovements of the animalâs own limb.
