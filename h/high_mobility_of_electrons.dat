40|$|PbSe is a {{surprisingly}} good thermoelectric material due, in part, to its low thermal conductivity {{that had been}} overestimated in earlier measurements.

40|$|One-dimensional {{semiconductor}} nanostructures {{have attracted}} much attention because of their potential applications {{in the design of}} novel electronic, photonic, and sensing devices. Due to their <b>high</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> and holes, Ge nanowires are particularly attractive for high-speed field-effect transistors. Moreover, Ge nanowires are potentially useful for building quantum bits because of a long decoherence time due to a predominance of spin-zero nuclei and the advantage of a large excitonic Bohr radius (24. 3 nm) which allows the quantum confinement to be observed for relatively large structures and at high temperatures. To realize these applications on a large scale, one of the key challenges is to develop a convenient and parallel method to align bottom-up nanowires into complex patterns or structures. Recently, a "pick and place" method is most widely used for integrating nanowires. However, these processes lack control in precision, repeatability, and easily induce contamination and defects in the wires. It is expected to selectively grow nanowires directly onto desired areas of the substrate and in situ fabricate the nanowire devices. In the VLS (vapor-liquid-solid) CVD process, gold catalysts initiate and guide the growth of nanowires. Hence, precise control the location of nanowires relies on the capability to control the location of Au clusters.

Second, the electrodes are struck and the burn-back phenomenon takes place. Usually, the silver ribbon is enclosed inside a cavity filled with silica sand. During the vaporization of the fuse element, one can consider that the volume is fixed so that the pressure increase appears to reach pressures higher than atmospheric pressure. Thus, in this paper two pressures, 1 atm and 10 atm, are considered. The electrical field inside the plasma can reach high values since {{the distance between the}} cathode surface and the anode surface varies with time. That is to say from zero cm to one cm order. So we consider various electrical fields: 102 V/m, 103 V/m, 5 × 103 V/m, 104 V/m at atmospheric pressure and 105 V/m at a pressure of 10 atm. This study is made in heavy species temperature range from 2, 400 K to 10, 000 K.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{theoretical and}} experimental studies into the optical response of single and multiple layer graphene in the terahertz to infrared regime {{and provides a}} description of some the unique characteristics of graphene. In this work, the Schrödinger time-dependent equation is employed for gapless and gapped graphene in monolayers and bilayers to specify the optical and electronic characteristics and describe the electronic transitions in the structuring of the honeycomb lattice that depend on the Hamiltonian equation and include applied electric field. The energy band dispersion and wave function are calculated by using a quantum mechanical approach, together with the tight-binding model, and a comparison with Bloch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is included {{in order to satisfy}} the theoretical details and provide a description of the low energy bands of graphene. Furthermore, this procedure has been used to study the interband transitions. The Boltzmann formula has also been used to describe the intraband transitions. To analyze our results, models for the optical response of graphene single layers and bilayer are taken into account, based on the electronic system described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution at different temperatures and in the most important frequency regime. The linear and nonlinear optical conductivity and current density have been calculated to first and the third order for single-layer gapped and gapless graphene and bilayer graphene. It is demonstrated that the third order nonlinear response includes single frequency and frequency tripling nonlinear terms. In the present results, single layer graphene on a SiO 2 substrate layer shows a strong response in the p-n junction regime in the nonlinear optical conductivity. It is also shown that the conductivity can be negative within a limited range of frequencies, depending on the bias voltage (Vb) and when (hω 3 ̆c eVb). In the terahertz regime, the negative conductivity increases with increasing relaxation time and gate voltage, and with decreasing temperature. In this kind of p-n junction, the nonlinear optical response in the gapped and gapless graphene shows a strong response under forward bias. Also, the negative conductance provides a unique mechanism for photon generation in graphene and could be used for developing coherent terahertz radiation sources. In the both the weak field and the strong field Fermi-Dirac distribution, the linear and nonlinear current density of single-layer gapped and gapless graphene has been calculated as a function of temperature. In gapless graphene, the nonlinear current effect increases with temperature up to room temperature, and is very much stronger than the linear current density. The third order nonlinear optical response in strong field is asymmetric between μ 3 ̆e 0 μ 3 ̆c 0 and and can be stronger than that in weak field. The nonlinear optical response in gapped graphene is stronger than in gapless graphene under weak field at zero to finite temperature, and it increases with increasing temperature with a finite gap. The linear and the nonlinear optical responses in gapped graphene are affected by the strong field (under the Fermi-Dirac distribution) but the opposite is true with the linear gapless graphene. For bilayer graphene, the optical conductivity can be affected by changing the temperature. Increasing the temperature from low to room temperature leads to a decrease in the optical conductivity where there is an electric field of 1000 V/cm. In addition, the nonlinear optical response decreases gradually with increasing frequency. Also, the single frequency nonlinear response is greater than the frequency tripled nonlinear response in different frequency ranges. The critical electric field {{plays an important role in}} equalizing the linear and nonlinear optical responses at a specific field of 103 V/cm. Also, the critical field increases with increasing frequency or temperature. It is demonstrated that the second order response in single and bilayer gapless and gapped graphene is equal to zero in both the strong field and the weak field regimes due to the inversion symmetry of the graphene structure. Transmittance spectra from the terahertz to the infrared range in the multilayer sample (Graphene on substrate) and single layer samples (graphene only) at room temperature could be feasibly collected and were useful due to the <b>high</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in graphene at room temperature. Fourier transform spectroscopy is used to describe the transmittance of graphene and graphite films under room pressure and in vacuum. In the present results, graphene multilayer on Si substrate has low resistance at room temperature, less than that of the silicon alone. In addition, a new method was developed to calculate the transmittance and reflectance through multiple layers. This method is demonstrated to be more accurate than the classic (general) method. The theoretical and experimental results also show good convergence at short and long wavelengths. Finally, the highly tunable and strong optical properties of graphene-based materials make graphene a new alternative candidate to most of the semiconductor materials. Also, the high transmittance and low resistance of graphene represent a remarkable result. Therefore, we suggest that graphene could be a candidate for developing optoelectronics devices and graphene-based optical applications, as well as being useful for building innovative devices for nonlinear terahertz applications...|$|E

Carbonization of the source was identified as a major reason behind the polytype inclusion occurrence during the growth.

For comparison growth in argon atmosphere (at 5 mbar) was performed. The effect of the ambient on the impurity incorporation was studied for different growth temperatures.

High resistivity 4 H-SiC samples grown by sublimation with high growth rate were studied. The measurements show resistivity values up to high 104 cm. By correlation between the growth conditions and SIMS results, a model was applied in which it is proposed that an isolated carbon vacancy donor-like level is a possible candidate responsible for compensation of the shallow acceptors in p-type 4 H-SiC. A relation between cathodoluminescence (CL) and DLTS data is taken into account to support the model. To meet the requirements for high voltage blocking devices such as high voltage Schottky diodes and MOSFETs, 4 H-SiC epitaxial layers have to exhibit low doping concentration in order to block reverse voltages up to few keV {{and at the same time}} have a low on-state resistance (Ron). High Ron leads to enhanced power consumption in the operation mode of the devices. In growth of thick layers for high voltage blocking devices, the conditions to achieve good on-state characteristics become more challenging due to the low doping and pronounced thicknesses needed, preferably in short growth periods. In case of high-speed epitaxy such as the sublimation, the need to apply higher growth temperature to yield the high growth rate, results in an increased concentration of background impurities in the layers as well as an influence on the intrinsic defects. On-state resistance Ron estimated from current density-voltage characteristics of Schottky diodes on thick sublimation layers exhibits variations from tens of mΩ. cm 2 to tens of Ω. cm 2 for different doping levels. In order to understand the occurrence of high on-state resistance, Schottky barrier heights were first estimated for both forward and reverse bias with the application of thermionic emission theory and were in agreement with literature reported values. Decrease in mobility with increasing temperature was observed and its dependencies of T– 1. 3 and T– 2. 0 for moderately doped and low doped samples, respectively, were estimated. From deep level measurements by Minority Carrier Transient Spectroscopy (MCTS), an influence of shallow boron related levels and D-center on the on-state resistance was observed, being more pronounced in low doped samples. Similar tendency was observed in depth profiling of Ron. This suggests a major role of boron in a compensation mechanism. In the second part of the thesis growth and characterization of GaN is presented. Excellent electron transport properties with high electron saturate drift velocity make GaN an excellent candidate for electronic devices. Especially, AlGaN/GaN based high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) have received an increased attention in last years due to their attractive properties. The presence of strong spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization due to the lattice mismatch between AlGaN and GaN is responsible for high free electrons concentrations present in the vicinity of the interface. Due to the spatial separation of electrons and ionized donors or surface states, 2 DEG electron gas formed near the interface of the heterostructure exhibits high sheet carrier density and <b>high</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> Al 0. 23 Ga 0. 77 N/GaN based HEMT structures with an AlN exclusion layer on 100 mm semiinsulating 4 H-SiC substrates have been grown by hot-wall MOCVD. The electrical properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) such as electron mobility, sheet carrier density and sheet resistance were obtained from Hall measurements, capacitance-voltage and contact-less eddy-current techniques. The effect of different scattering mechanisms on the mobility have been taken into account and compared to the experimental data. Hall measurements were performed in the range of 80 to 600 K. Hall electron mobility is equal to 17140 cm 2 (Vs) - 1 at 80 K, 2310 cm 2 (Vs) - 1 at room temperature, and as high as 800 cm 2 (Vs) - 1 at 450 K, while the sheet carrier density is 1. 04 x 1013 cm- 2 at room temperature and does not vary very much with temperature. Estimation of different electron scattering mechanisms reveals that at temperatures higher than room temperature, experimental mobility data is mainly limited by optical phonon scattering. At relevant high power device temperature (450 K) there is still an increase of mobility due to the AlN exclusion layer. We have studied the behaviour of Ga-face GaN epilayers after in-situ thermal treatment in different gas mixtures in a hot-wall MOCVD reactor. Influence of N 2, N 2 +NH 3 and N 2 +NH 3 +H 2 ambient on the morphology was investigated in this work. The most stable thermal treatment conditions were obtained in the case of N 2 +NH 3 gas ambients. We have also studied the effect of the increased molar ratio of hydrogen in order to establish proper etching conditions for hot-wall MOCVD growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{evolution of the}} wake of a conducting body is studied experimentally in a pulsed plasma device. Three-dimensional measurements of the plasma potential, density, particle energy distribution, and ion currents are measured throughout the near- and mid-wake regions during the wake formation. It is found that the potential behind the conducting body is initially negative. This negative potential is caused by the <b>higher</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrons,</b> allowing them to flow into the ion free wake region. The negative potential in the wake region induces an electric field that pulls ions into the region behind the conducting body. However, the dominant factor in determining the length of the near wake is the thermal energy spread of the ions. At later times, as the sheath forms around the conducting body, ions are deflected by the potential gradient in the sheath region. This deflection, in addition to the thermal energy spread of the ions, determines the length of the near wake...|$|R

This technology is ammonia free and nitrogen for growth is activated in RF plasma source from nitrogen molecules. The new growth mechanism — adlayer enhanced lateral diffusion of adatoms on semiconductor surface is studied in plasma assisted MBE. This mechanism {{enables us to}} achieve high quality step-flow epitaxy at tempera-tures 600 − 750 ◦C, much lower than expected from classical estimates based on the melting point of GaN.

40|$|In laser micromachining, the {{ablation}} threshold (minimum fluence {{required to}} cause ablation) {{is a key}} performance parameter and overall indicator of the efficiency of material removal. For pulsed laser micromachining, this important observable depends upon material properties, pulse properties {{and the number of}} pulses applied in a complex manner that is not yet well understood. The incubation effect is one example. It manifests as a change in the ablation threshold as a function of number of laser pulses applied and is driven by photoinduced defect accumulation in the material. Here, we study femtosecond (800 nm, 110 fs, 0. 1 - 1 mJ/pulse) micromachining of a material with well-defined initial defect concentrations: doped Si across a range of dopant types and concentrations. The single-pulse ablation threshold (Fth, 1) was observed to decrease with increasing dopant concentration, from a maximum of 0. 70 J/cm 2 (+/- 0. 02) for undoped Si to 0. 51 J/cm 2 (+/- 0. 01) for highly N-type doped Si. The effect was greater for N-type doped Si than for P-type, consistent with the <b>higher</b> carrier <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> compared to holes. In contrast, the infinite-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,inf) was the same for all doping levels and types. We attribute this asymptotic behaviour to a maximum defect concentration that is independent of the initial defect concentration and type.

The principle of the diode operation relies on a non-uniform heating <b>of</b> the two-dimensional <b>electron</b> gas in microwave electric fields arising due to the asymmetric shape of the device. The voltage sensitivity of the diode at room temperature is dose to 0. 3 V W(exp - 1) at 10 GHz, which {{is comparable to the}} value obtained using similarly shaped and sized diodes based on bulk n-GaAs.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model for dusty plasma afterglow has been developed. Comparison with experimental data {{shows that the}} transition from ambipolar to free diffusion {{plays a major role}} in the decharging process Dusty or complex plasmas are ionised gases composed <b>of</b> <b>electrons,</b> ions and neutral species in which macroscopic charged dust particles are immersed. The dust particle charge (Qd) is related to the ion and electron currents (Ii and Ie respectively) onto the surface of the dust particle: dQd dt = Ie + Ii (1) These currents depend on the particle radius rd, the electron (ion) density and the electron (ion) temperature [1]. At equilibrium, currents compensate each other. In laboratory plasma, these particles are negatively charged due to a <b>higher</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrons.</b> The dust particle charging process is thus highly dependent on plasma species densities and temperatures. Many publications are devoted to the study of dust particle charge (see for example [2, 3, 4]). Recently the decharging of dust particles in complex plasma afterglow raises interest as well as the dust particle residual charge [5, 6, 7]. Indeed it has been observed that dust particles do keep residual electric charges when the power of a RF discharge is turned off. Moreover, negatively charged, neutral and positively charged dust particles have been obeserved in the late afterglow of the RF discharge. A four stage model has been proposed in order to explain these results (Fig. 1) [6]: • Firstly, the electron temperature decreases while the plasma density remains almost constant resulting in a strong decrease of dust particle charges. • Secondly, the plasma density decreases but ion and electron densities remain equal leading to almost no change in particle charge. 34 th EPS 2007; L.

The technological methods of manufacturing of indium antimonide nanowires arrays with high aspect ratio of the nanowire diameters to their length in the modified nanoporous anodic alumina matrixes were developed and tested. The microstructure and composition of the formed nanostructures were investigated. The electron microscopy allowed establishing that within each pore nanowires are formed with diameters of 35 nm and a length of 35 microns (equal to the matrix thickness). The electron probe x-ray microanalysis has shown that the atomic ratio of indium and antimony in the semiconductor nanostructures amounted to 38, 26 % and 61, 74 %, respectively.
