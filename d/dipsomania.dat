25|$|Edward Jarvis {{and later}} Francis Amasa Walker helped expand the census, from 2 volumes in 1870 to 25 volumes in 1880. Frederick H. Wines was {{appointed}} to write a 582-page volume called Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880) (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: dementia, <b>dipsomania</b> (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, monomania and paresis. These categories were also adopted by the Association.|$|E
500|$|Snodgrass was {{convinced}} that Poe died from alcoholism and did {{a great deal to}} popularize this idea. He was a supporter of the temperance movement and found Poe a useful example in his temperance work. However, Snodgrass's writings on the topic have been proven untrustworthy. Moran contradicted Snodgrass by stating in his own 1885 account that Poe did not die under the effect of any intoxicant. Moran claimed that Poe [...] "had not the slightest odor of liquor upon his breath or person". Even so, some newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as [...] "congestion of the brain" [...] or [...] "cerebral inflammation", euphemisms for deaths from disgraceful causes such as alcoholism. In a study of Poe, a psychologist suggested that Poe had <b>dipsomania.</b>|$|E

German neurologist Westphal, {{coined the}} term [...] "obsessional neurosis" [...] now termed obsessive-compulsive disorder, and agoraphobia. Alienists created a whole new series of diagnoses that highlighted single, impulsive behavior, such as kleptomania, <b>dipsomania,</b> pyromania, and nymphomania. The diagnosis of drapetomania was also developed in the Southern United States to explain the perceived irrationality of black slaves trying to escape what {{was thought to be}} a suitable role.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not bodily, but his despair {{over what}} {{has taken place}} is beyond us all. He sits silent over the {{accounts}} in his room at the office; will talk to none of us. Mr. Alison has tried--I have--Ben and all of us. He never looks up but to call for soda-water. If he yields again, it will soon be acute <b>dipsomania,</b> and then--" [...] he shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most likely not," [...] said Conolly, with a smile. [...] "You {{would have}} said {{something}} much prettier. But <b>dipsomania</b> {{is not one of}} the pretty things of life; nor can it by any stretch of benevolent hypocrisy be made to pass as one. When Susanna and I get talking, we do not waste time in trying to spare one another's feelings. If we did, we should both see through the attempt and be very impatient of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The other day, an {{emphatic}} {{friend of}} mine committed himself to the opinion that, in England, it is better for a man's worldly prospects to be a drunkard, than to be smitten with the divine <b>dipsomania</b> of the original investigator. I am inclined {{to think he was}} not far wrong. And, be it observed, that the question is not, whether such a man shall be able to make as much out of his abilities as his brother, of like ability, who goes into Law, or Engineering, or Commerce; it {{is not a question of}} [...] "maintaining a due number of saddle horses," [...] as George Eliot somewhere puts it--it is a question of living or starving.|$|E
6000|$|There will {{be little}} doubt he will answer [...] "Health." [...] After that {{probably}} he may say [...] "Beauty." [...] In addition the reader of Mr. Galton's Hereditary Genius will probably say, [...] "ability," [...] "capacity," [...] "genius," [...] and [...] "energy." [...] The reader of Doctor Nordau will add [...] "sanity." [...] And the reader of Mr. Archdall Reid will round up the list with [...] "immunity" [...] from <b>dipsomania</b> and all contagious diseases. [...] "Let us mark our human beings," [...] the reader of that way of thinking will suggest, [...] "let us give marks for 'health,' for 'ability,' for various sorts of specific immunity and so forth, and let us weed out those who are low in the scale and multiply those who stand high. This {{will give us a}} straight way to practical amelioration, and the difficulty you are trying to raise," [...] he urges, [...] "vanishes forthwith." ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{can hardly}} stop there. After we have taught the {{condition}} of health, we must teach also {{the condition of}} disease; of those diseases specially which tend to lessen wholesale the health of townsfolk, exposed to an artificial mode of life. Surely {{young men and women}} should be taught something of the causes of zymotic disease, and of scrofula, consumption, rickets, <b>dipsomania,</b> cerebral derangement, and such like. They should be shown the practical value of pure air, pure water, unadulterated food, sweet and dry dwellings. Is there one of them, man or woman, who would not be the safer and happier, and the more useful to his or her neighbours, if they had acquired some sound notions about those questions of drainage on which their own lives and the lives of their children may every day depend? I say--women as well as men. I should have said women rather than men. For it is the women who have the ordering of the household, the bringing up of the children; the women who bide at home, while the men are away, it may be {{at the other end of}} the earth.|$|E
60|$|And so I {{claim the}} first order for this jejune exploit of mine, and invite you {{to note that the}} final chapter, so remote from Scott and Dickens and so close to Ibsen, was written years before Ibsen came to my knowledge, thus proving that the revolt of the Life Force against readymade {{morality}} in the nineteenth century was not the work of a Norwegian microbe, but would have worked itself into expression in English literature had Norway never existed. In fact, when Miss Lord's translation of A Doll's House appeared in the eighteen-eighties, and so excited some of my Socialist friends that they got up a private reading of it in which I was cast for the part of Krogstad, its novelty as a morally original study of a marriage did not stagger me as it staggered Europe. I had made a morally original study of a marriage myself, and made it, too, without any melodramatic forgeries, spinal diseases, and suicides, though I had to confess to a study of <b>dipsomania.</b> At all events, I chattered and ate caramels in the back drawing-room (our green-room) whilst Eleanor Marx, as Nora, brought Helmer to book at {{the other side of the}} folding doors. Indeed I concerned myself very little about Ibsen until, later on, William Archer translated Peer Gynt to me viva voce, when the magic of the great poet opened my eyes in a flash to the importance of the social philosopher.|$|E
60|$|Walter Scott is a great, and, therefore, mysterious man. He {{will never}} be {{understood}} until Romance is understood, {{and that will be}} only when Time, Man, and Eternity are understood. To say that Scott had more than any other man that ever lived a sense of the romantic seems, in these days, a slight and superficial tribute. The whole modern theory arises from one fundamental mistake--the idea that romance is in some way a plaything with life, a figment, a conventionality, a thing upon the outside. No genuine criticism of romance will ever arise until we have grasped the fact that romance lies not upon the outside of life but absolutely in the centre of it. The centre of every man's existence is a dream. Death, disease, insanity, are merely material accidents, like toothache or a twisted ankle. That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel. The boast of the realist (applying what the reviewers call his scalpel) is that he cuts into the heart of life; but he makes a very shallow incision if he only reaches as deep as habits and calamities and sins. Deeper than all these lies a man's vision of himself, as swaggering and sentimental as a penny novelette. The literature of candour unearths innumerable weaknesses and elements of lawlessness which is called romance. It perceives superficial habits like murder and <b>dipsomania,</b> but it does not perceive the deepest of sins--the sin of vanity--vanity which is the mother of all day-dreams and adventures, the one sin that is not shared with any boon companion, or whispered to any priest.|$|E
60|$|Another {{advantage}} of public medical {{work is that}} it admits of organization, and consequently {{of the distribution of}} the work in such a manner as to avoid wasting the time of highly qualified experts on trivial jobs. The individualism of private practice leads to an appalling waste of time on trifles. Men whose dexterity as operators or almost divinatory skill in diagnosis are constantly needed for difficult cases, are poulticing whitlows, vaccinating, changing unimportant dressings, prescribing ether drams for ladies with timid leanings towards <b>dipsomania,</b> and generally wasting their time in the pursuit of private fees. In no other profession is the practitioner expected to do all the work involved in it from the first day of his professional career to the last as the doctor is. The judge passes sentence of death; but he is not expected to hang the criminal with his own hands, as he would be if the legal profession were as unorganized as the medical. The bishop is not expected to blow the organ or wash the baby he baptizes. The general is not asked to plan a campaign or conduct a battle at half-past twelve and to play the drum at half-past two. Even if they were, things would still not be as bad as in the medical profession; for in it not only is the first-class man set to do third-class work, but, what is much more terrifying, the third-class man is expected to do first-class work. Every general practitioner is supposed to be capable of the whole range of medical and surgical work at a moment's notice; and the country doctor, who has not a specialist nor a crack consultant {{at the end of his}} telephone, often has to tackle without hesitation cases which no sane practitioner in a town would take in hand without assistance. No doubt this develops the resourcefulness of the country doctor, and makes him a more capable man than his suburban colleague; but it cannot develop the second-class man into a first-class one. If the practice of law not only led to a judge having to hang, but the hangman to judge, or if in the army matters were so arranged that it would be possible for the drummer boy to be in command at Waterloo whilst the Duke of Wellington was playing the drum in Brussels, we should not be consoled by the reflection that our hangmen were thereby made a little more judicial-minded, and our drummers more responsible, than in foreign countries where the legal and military professions recognized the advantages of division of labor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipsomania</b> is a {{historical}} term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol. In the 19th century, the term <b>dipsomania</b> was {{used to refer to}} a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as alcoholism. <b>Dipsomania</b> is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of <b>dipsomania</b> is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek dipso ("δίψα"= thirst) and mania.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>dipsomania</b> {{was used}} {{in a variety of}} {{somewhat}} contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness. [...] In his 1893 book Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of <b>Dipsomania,</b> Magnan characterized <b>dipsomania</b> as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available. Magnan further described <b>dipsomania</b> as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{influence}} of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, <b>dipsomania</b> became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century. Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes <b>dipsomania</b> as [...] "the most medical" [...] of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century. Along with terms such as [...] "inebriety", the idea of <b>dipsomania</b> was used {{as part of an effort}} of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease. As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this <b>dipsomania</b> reform movement, it [...] "illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sources {{that may}} have contributed to the {{adoption}} of the term in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the first twelve-step group, include spirituality, New Thought and the work of William James.

Brühl-Cramer classified <b>dipsomania</b> {{in terms of}} continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its cause, pathogenesis, sequelae, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the laws of chemistry and concepts of excitability.|$|E

Many themes are explored {{in the lives of}} his family, particularly luxurious frivolity (especially in the 1920s) and <b>dipsomania.</b> The book often seems to blur the lines of fiction and history by offering diverse accounts of certain incidents and retellings of isolated events about which the author couldn't logically know so many intimate details.

50|$|The word 'addiction' has {{successfully}} been {{traced to the}} 17th century. During this time period, addiction was defined as being compelled to act out any number of bad habits. Persons abusing narcotics were called opium and morphine 'eaters.' 'Drunkard' referred to abusers of alcohol. Medical textbooks categorized these 'bad habits' as <b>dipsomania</b> or alcoholism However, it wasn't until the 19th century when the diagnosis was first printed in medical literature. In the 1880s, Sigmund Freud and William Halsted began experimenting with users of cocaine. Unaware of the drug's powerful addictive qualities, they inadvertently became guinea pigs in their own research and, as a result, their contributions to psychology and medicine changed the world.|$|E

5000|$|From 1946, California ran an {{insurance}} system to cover private sector employees if temporarily unemployed {{because of a}} disability not covered by workmen’s compensation. It was funded by contributions deducted from the wages of participating employees, for whom participation was generally mandatory unless they belonged to an approved private insurance plan. Employees who had contributed 1% of a minimum income to the disability fund for one year prior to a period of disability were eligible to receive benefits. However, certain disabilities would not be covered, including those resulting from commitment for <b>dipsomania,</b> drug addiction, or sexual psychopathy. [...] In Geduldig, the appellees challenged the further exclusion of certain disabilities resulting from pregnancy, as found in §2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code: “In no case shall the term ‘disability’ or ‘disabled’ include any injury or illness caused by or arising in connection with pregnancy up to the termination of such pregnancy and {{for a period of}} 28 days thereafter.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim Bergerac was {{a complex}} character, {{presented}} by the series as a somewhat unorthodox police officer. He was recovering from alcoholism, partly resulting from an unpleasant divorce. A Jersey native, {{he returned to the}} island {{at the start of the}} series after recuperating in England from ill health <b>dipsomania</b> and major surgery on his leg following an accident caused by his drinking heavily prior to an attempted arrest. The accident was shown in episode two as a flashback: Bergerac was swigging brandy during a surveillance when he noticed his suspect and gave chase. Under the influence of his drinking, he attempted to prevent the man's escape by leaping onto his boat and got his leg crushed against the harbour wall as he slipped back. He was deemed unfit for the force as a result of this accident, but helped his old colleagues out in the recently formed [...] "Bureau des étrangers" [...] and was posted to that unit. By the end of the series Bergerac had become a private detective.|$|E
5000|$|Thacher visited Wilson at Towns Hospital and {{introduced}} him to the basic tenets of the Oxford Group and to the book Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), by American psychologist and philosopher William James. Upon reading the book, Wilson was later to state that the phrase [...] "deflation at depth" [...] leapt out at him from the page of James's book; however, this phrase does not appear in the book. It was James's theory that spiritual transformations come from calamities, and their source lies in pain and hopelessness. James's belief concerning alcoholism was that the cure for <b>dipsomania</b> was religiomania. [...] Upon his release from the hospital on December 18, 1934, Wilson moved from the Calvary Rescue Mission to the Oxford meetings at Calvary House. There Wilson socialized after the meetings with other ex-drinking Oxfords and became interested in learning how to help other alcoholics achieve sobriety. It was during this time that Wilson went on a crusade to save alcoholics. Sources for his prospects were the Calvary Rescue Mission and Towns Hospital. But of all the alcoholics Wilson tried to help, not one stayed sober.|$|E

All of their patients are these drunken old men. Nucki is driven over by the carriage, and is taken in to be helped. When the daughters see Nucki, the only handsome and young man, they go wild, and fight over him, which he doesn’t mind at all. They decide to have a boxing match to decide who will cure the man.
