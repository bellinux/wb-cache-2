40|$|Abstract:- To {{provide more}} {{reliable}} service for drivers, {{it is necessary}} to establish an optimization framework in which a reliability index is adopted as a performance index to evaluate <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> First, a modified four-level model of unblocked reliability (link, path, Origin-Destination pair and entire <b>road</b> <b>network)</b> is proposed, in which the unblocked reliabilities of the Origin-Destination pair and the entire <b>road</b> <b>network</b> are formulated by the law of total probability when the unblocked reliability of path is a conditional probability. Then, a bi-level program is established based on the new model of unblocked reliability since planners design the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and drivers respond the change in the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The objective function of the upper-level program is the maximized balance between the unblocked reliability of the entire <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expansion ratio which implies cost of improving the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The program equivalent of Stochastic User Equilibrium is adopted as the lower-level model so as to achieve consistency in route choices and to model the congestion effect in the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> Next, a set of link capacity expansions is determined as a planning scheme by solving the bi-level program. This planning scheme not only improves the link of lower reliability but also takes into account the performance of the Origin-Destination pair and the entire <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The proposed optimization framework is capable of improving the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> to its highest possible reliability level with a minimum scale of <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expansion...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>network</b> {{robustness}} is {{the ability}} of a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> to operate correctly under a wide range of attacks. A structural robustness analysis can describe the survivability of a city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> that is under attack and can help improve functions such as urban planning and emergency response. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to quantitatively evaluate <b>road</b> <b>network</b> robustness based on the community structure derived from a city <b>road</b> <b>network,</b> in which communities refer to those densely connected subsets of nodes that are sparsely linked to the remaining <b>network.</b> First, a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> is reconstructed into a set of connected communities. Then, successive simulated attacks are conducted on the reconstructed <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> to test the performance of the networks under attack. The performance of the networks is represented by efficiency and the occurrence of fragmentation. Three attack strategies, including a random attack and two intentional attacks, are performed to evaluate the survivability of the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> under different situations. Contrary to the traditional road segment-based approach, the community-based robustness analysis on a city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> shows distinct structural diversity between communities, providing greater insight into network vulnerability under intentional attacks. Six typical city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> on three different continents are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The evaluation results reveal an important feature of the structure of city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> from a community-based perspective, i. e., that the structure is robust under random failure but fragile under intentional attack. This result is highly consistent in different city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> forms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The city road system, as well {{as other}} complex systems, can be modeled as networks. Studies {{investigating}} the relationship between network structure and functionality provide a novel perspective to investigate the robustness of a city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> by analyzing its structure. The fact that different events may lead to different levels of traffic interruption requires that the investigation on the robustness of city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> be conducted at multiple granularities. In this study, <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> are modeled at three different granularities: segment-based, stroke-based and community-based model to investigate the response of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> under punctiform, linear and zonal traffic interruptions respectively. An empirical study with six city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> around the world shows that the topological structure, especially the diversity level in the betweenness centrality distribution of the network, is more essential to the robustness of the city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> than geographical features and inherent attributes. The performances of city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> under attacks are consistent in different cities due to the similarity in their topological structures but differ by granularity because city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> modeled at different granularities have different topological structures. This variation illustrates that the robustness analysis of city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> should be modeled at the appropriate granularity for a given traffic situation. Furthermore, empirical results suggest that the tolerance threshold for urban traffic is the critical point where the city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> begins to split into several components. The robustness analysis solution proposed in this article can identify these critical points to provide an early warning in urban traffic interruptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Empirically, the smaller diameter a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> has, the more connected and efficient the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> is.

Then we can focus on increasing the algebraic connectivity instead of reducing the network diameter, under the budget constraints. The above formulation leads to a semi-definite program, in which we can get its global solution easily. Then, we present some simulation experiments to show the correctness of our method. At last, we compare our method with an existing method based on the genetic algorithm. ...|$|R
