Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, {{it is unlikely to}} contain gross errors of fact.|$|E

Pussy Riot strove to make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
