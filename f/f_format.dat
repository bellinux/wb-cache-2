Four focus groups were conducted with 32 participants. Four researchers coded the data and conducted a qualitative thematic analysis. Four overarching themes were identified. Three domains apply to both VW and F 2 F formats, including (1) the value of DSM knowledge gained, (2) cultivating DSM attitudes and skills, and (3) the value of peer-derived social support. The fourth domain is labeled positive technological development for DSM (VW condition only). VW and F 2 F groups both reported mastery of DSM knowledge, attitudes, and skills, {{and there were no}} differences in peer-derived social support between groups. The technological aspects of VW participation afforded VW participants a unique sense of personal agency and diabetes self-efficacy not reported by F 2 F participants. DSM education in a VW is feasible and educational outcomes are similar to a F 2 F classroom experience. Furthermore, learning DSM skills in a VW offers unique advantages in supporting personal agency for health behavior change. Further research is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite the {{effectiveness}} of pharmacotherapy {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia, up to 60 % continue to experience distressing symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions. Adjunctive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is now recommended in many countries. There has been some debate as to whether CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia. Meta-analyses to date have shown varying results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine moderating effects of a) study/trial quality, b) comprehensiveness of the CBT intervention, c) manualized vs. non manualized treatments, d) control group, e) chronicity of presentations of schizophrenia, and <b>f)</b> <b>format</b> of treatment. Method: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PsychInfo, Scopus, Embase and Medline to identify randomized controlled trials reporting on the impact of CBT on positive, negative, global psychopathology and total symptoms and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Results: 23 studies including 2, 639 participants published between 1990 and 2015 were identified. Small and largely non-significant effect sizes were found at post-treatment for total symptoms (g= 0. 19), negative symptoms (g= 0. 12) and global psychopathology (g= 0. 12), with a significant but small effect size found for the reduction of positive symptoms (g= 0. 19). Moderators had little impact overall, with no consistent evidence of quality, comprehensiveness, manualisation, control group, stage of illness or format of treatment moderating effect size for any symptom type.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in general properties of classes of transition system specifications in Plotkin style. The discussion takes place in a setting of labelled transition systems. The states of the transition systems are terms generated by a single sorted signature and the transitions between states are defined by conditional rules over tne syntax. It is argued that in this setting it is natural to require that strong bisimulation equivalence be a congruence on the states of the transition systems. A general format, called the fyft/tyxt format, is presented for the rules in a transition system specification, such that bisimulation is always a congruence when all the rules fit this format. With a series of examples it is demonstrated that the <b>f.</b> vft/tyxf <b>format</b> cannot be generalized in any obvious way. Another series of examples illustrates the usefulness of our congruence theorem. BriefIy we touch upon the issue of modularity of transition system specifications.

Additional factors in this study include the relationship between student and faculty achievement orientation and classroom context through the use of vignettes.

Respondents completed inventories using a web-based survey site from which data were downloaded and analyses completed. A multi-method approach was used to gain awareness of participant perceptions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on this research and consistent with previous research, students and faculty identified cheating behaviors as academically dishonest in online and F 2 F learning environments and faculty anticipated cheating behaviors more than students. Moreover, findings indicated that when cheating occurs, students are collaborating on assessments, particularly when those requirements are completed outside of a traditional classroom.

The ParaSight F+V assay advanced upon the ParaSight <b>F</b> test <b>format</b> by incorporating a monoclonal antibody directed against a proprietary Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen, in addition to the antibody directed against P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, which was used in the ParaSight F assay. The modified assay was developed to add the capability to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax in a single-test-strip format. The present study evaluated three distinct ParaSight F+V prototypes with samples from symptomatic patients in regions of Thailand and Peru where malaria is endemic. Over a 2 -year enrollment period (1998 and 1999), a total of 4, 894 patients consented to participation in the study. Compared with the results for duplicate microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained blood smears as the reference diagnostic standard, each successive prototype showed substantial improvement in performance. The final ParaSight F+V prototype, evaluated in 1999, had an overall sensitivity for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasites of 98 %. The sensitivity of the device was 100 % for P. falciparum densities of > 500 parasites/μl, with a sensitivity of 83 % for parasite densities of ≤ 500 /μl. The specificity for the exclusion of P. falciparum was 93 %. For P. vivax, the overall sensitivity was 87 % for the final 1999 prototype. The sensitivities calculated for different levels of P. vivax parasitemia were 99 % for parasite densities of > 5, 000 /μl, 92 % for parasite densities of 1, 001 to 5, 000 /μl, 94 % for parasite densities of 501 to 1, 000 /μl, and 55 % for parasite densities of 1 to 500 /μl.

[...] - METHOD: We analyzed the data on exam grades for Anatomy and Chemistry courses {{in the first year}} of the curriculum for academic year 2001 / 02, with the traditional continual delivery of the courses (n= 253 for chemistry and n= 243 for anatomy), and academic year 2003 / 04, with block delivery of the courses (n= 255 for Chemistry and n= 260 for Anatomy). Grades from the final examination were analyzed only for students who sat the exam at the first available exam term and passed the course. For the Anatomy block course, grades at 2 interim written tests and 2 parts of the final exam (practical stage exam and oral exam) in each block were analyzed for students who passed all interim tests and the final exam. [...] - RESULTS: There were no differences between two types of course delivery in the number of students passing the final examination at first attempt. There was a decrease in passing percentage for the two Anatomy block course student groups in 2003 / 04 (56 % passing students in block 1 vs 40 % in block 2, P= 0. 014). There was an increase in the average grades from 2001 / 02 to 2003 / 04 academic year due to an increase in Chemistry grades (F 1, 399 = 18. 4, P< 0. 001, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was no effect of the sequence of their delivery (F 1, 206 = 1. 8, P= 0. 182, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was also a significant difference in grades on interim assessments of Anatomy when it was delivered in the block <b>format</b> (<b>F</b> 3, 85 = 28. 8, P< 0. 001, between-within subjects 2 x 4 ANOVA). [...] - CONCLUSIONS: The type of course delivery was not associated with significant differences in student academic success in Anatomy and Chemistry courses in the medical curriculum. Students can successfully pass these courses when they are delivered either in a continual, whole year format or in a condensed time format of a course block, regardless of the number and type of courses preceding the block course...|$|R

F 77 NNS is an ANSI- 77 FORTRAN {{program designed to}} take advantage of vectorization when run on machines having this capability, but it will run on any computer with an ANSI- 77 FORTRAN Compiler. Artificial neural networks are formed from hundreds or thousands of simulated neurons, connected to each other {{in a manner similar to}} biological nerve cells. Problems which involve pattern matching or system modeling readily fit the class of problems which F 77 NNS is designed to solve. The program's formulation trains a neural network using Rumelhart's back-propagation algorithm. Typically the nodes of a network are grouped together into clumps called layers. A network will generally have an input layer through which the various environmental stimuli are presented to the network, and an output layer for determining the network's response. The number of nodes in these two layers is usually tied to features of the problem being solved. Other layers, which form intermediate stops between the input and output layers, are called hidden layers. The back-propagation training algorithm can require massive computational resources to implement a large network such as a network capable of learning text-to-phoneme pronunciation rules as in the famous Sehnowski experiment. The Sehnowski neural network learns to pronounce 1000 common English words. The standard input data defines the specific inputs that control the type of run to be made, and input files define the NN in terms of the layers and nodes, as well as the input/output (I/O) pairs. The program has a restart capability so that a neural network can be solved in stages suitable to the user's resources and desires. F 77 NNS allows the user to customize the patterns of connections between layers of a network. The size of the neural network to be solved is limited only by the amount of random access memory (RAM) available to the user. The program has a memory requirement of about 900 K. The standard distribution medium for this package is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. It is also available on a 3. 5 inch diskette in UNIX tar <b>format.</b> <b>F</b> 77 NNS was developed in 1989...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} found animated instructions {{can lead to}} better learning of a human movement task when compared to equivalent statics (Ayres et al 2009), due to our innate ability to learn by observing movements. Moreover, De Koning & Tabbers’ (2011) review found gestures, also forms of human movement, can facilitate learning. A previous study (Marcus et al, CLT 2013) that focussed on adults learning Mandarin characters, found gestures improved learning from statics significantly more than animations. In this study we consider whether gestures can improve learning of a motor task for children, {{if there is a}} difference for static versus animated instructions, and tasks of different difficulty levels. We focus on primary school children learning Persian characters. We hypothesize that including human movement into an instructional format will benefit learning as it taps into our movement processor. Thus the first hypothesis is that animations will lead to better performance than statics. Our second is that including gesture will lead to better learning than no gesture. Lastly we predict an interaction effect, and hypothesize that gesture will facilitate learning more for statics than animation. Gesturing may become redundant for more difficult animations when cognitive load is higher. Method: Four groups of 11 grade 1 and 2 students, were given a series of 9 Persian characters to learn to write, ranging in difficulty level from easy to medium to difficult. Two groups received animated instructional materials, with one group asked to gesture while learning. The other two groups received equivalent static graphics, with one group gesturing. All groups had equal learning times. The students were then tested on ability to reproduce the characters including correct strokes and dots, drawing order, and positioning relative to a guide line. Results from a MANOVA supported our hypothesis with a significant overall interaction between gesture and instructional format (F(3, 38) = 7. 42, p <. 001) as well as significant main effects for presentation <b>format</b> (<b>F</b> = 28. 0, p <. 001), with animations outperforming statics, and gesturing (F = 16. 5, p <. 001), with gesturing outperforming non-gesturing. Univariate tests indicated a significant interaction for both easy and medium tasks, but not the difficult task. Simple effects tests showed that for the static presentation, all three tasks found gesturing superior to non-gesturing. For the animated presentation, only the easy task produced a gesturing advantage. Conclusion: Our results provide support for the existence of a human movement processor that when invoked can support learning, particularly for human movement tasks. Gesturing supported learning for young children, particularly for easier tasks (when less cognitively loaded) and when learning from statics (movement is not inherent to this instructional format). As expected, animations led to better learning than statics. Gesturing was redundant for the more difficult animated tasks when children were cognitively challenged, and movement was inherent.

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 是目前廣為使用的無線區域網路標準，許多廠商都積極投入製造符合 802. 11 標準的無線區域網路產品。但是 802. 11 並沒有規範該如何實做Distribution System(DS) ，當使用者要在不同廠牌的AP間漫遊時會因為DS的實現方式不同而造成AP間彼此無法傳遞保持連線時所需的資訊。這將會是廣泛建置 802. 11 無線區域網路的一大障礙。 802. 11 f就是為了解決這個問題而提出的協定，它提供了許多服務讓不同廠牌的AP間能夠互相溝通、傳遞訊息。然而 802. 11 f只能提供使用者在同一子網域時的漫遊服務，一但使用者進入了不同的子網域後網路連線便會中斷。Mobile IP就是為解決無線區域網路間的漫遊問題而制定，它提供了使用者在不同網域間漫遊時還能保持網路連線的服務。此外網際網路服務供應商必須要有一套認證、授權、計費(Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, AAA) 的架構來處理使用者在不同網域間漫遊時的安全與計費問題。對於一些較大型的網路而言，使用者所到的網域可能會因為離本地代理者(Home Agent, HA) 很遠而使得Mobile IP註冊時間的延遲情形更為嚴重。 在本論文中我們先對 802. 11 f做簡單的介紹並且分析 802. 11 f與Mobile IP協同工作的情況。我們從理論上提出了一個在認証、授權 架構下 802. 11 與Mobile IP整合的模型來改善無線區域網路同網域與跨網域的漫遊效能並說明這個模型如何運作以及可能遇到的問題。在同一子網域漫遊時我們利用”context pre-transfer model ”來預先建立 802. 11 的連線環境。在跨網域情形下我們利用”Simultaneous Handoff of Mobile IPv 4 and 802. 11, [SIMIP]“ 來同時處理 802. 11 與Mobile IP 的註冊訊息。此外為了縮短Mobile IP註冊的時間我們利用了Diameter協定裡的新功能來指定一個新的本地代理者給使用者。IEEE 802. 11 Wireless LAN {{standard}} was ratified {{a few years}} ago and lots of vendors have engaged in the manufacture of Wireless LAN products compliant with 802. 11. However, 802. 11 did not specify how to implement Distribution System (DS). When mobile nodes roam among access points (AP) of different vendors, the context transfer used to keep connection uninterrupted may be failed. This will become a hurdle to widely deploy 802. 11 Wireless LAN. In order to overcome this problem, 802. 11 f was proposed and specified a set of services that will enable multi-vendor access points to interoperate with each other. However, 802. 11 f only works when a mobile node roams in the same subnet. Once the mobile node moves across different subnets, data connection between terminals will break down. Originally engineered as a solution for Wireless LAN, Mobile IP enables a mobile node to move freely from one subnet to another without disrupting end-to-end connectivity. Besides, the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) architecture is essential for Internet Service Provider (ISP) to handle security and accounting considerations, especially when users roam among different administrative domains. For some big network domains, the mobile node's current network attach point could be far away from its static home agent and would cause a long delay when registration request is processed. In this thesis, we first give an introduction to 802. 11 f and analyze the situation as 802. 11 f cooperates with Mobile IP. In order to improve both intra and inter domain roaming efficiency, we propose a theoretical model which integrates 802. 11 and Mobile IP in AAA environment. We analyze the operation of the model and discuss what kinds of problem this model faces. In intra domain roaming, we make use of the “context pre-transfer model” to pre-establish 802. 11 services for the user. In inter domain roaming, we also utilize “Simultaneous Handoff of Mobile IPv 4 and 802. 11 ” (SIMIP) to process 802. 11 reassociation and Mobile IP registration at the same time. Furthermore, we use a new function of next generation AAA protocol, Diameter, to allocate a new home agent for the user to process subsequent Mobile IP registration locally. 中文摘要 [...] I Abstract [...] III 致謝 [...] V Table of Contents [...] VI List of Figures [...] XI List of Tables [...] XIV Chapter 1 Introduction [...] 1 1. 1 Overview [...] . 1 1. 2 Motivation [...] 2 1. 3 Thesis Organization [...] . 3 Chapter 2 IEEE 802. 11 Architecture [...] 4 2. 1 802. 11 PHY and MAC Overview [...] . 4 2. 2 General Description of 802. 11 Architecture [...] 6 2. 3 Components of 802. 11 Architecture [...] . 7 2. 3. 1 Independent BSS [...] . 7 2. 3. 2 Infrastructure BSS [...] 8 2. 4 Distribution System Sevices [...] . 9 2. 5 802. 11 f Overview [...] . 11 2. 5. 1 Purpose of 802. 11 f [...] . 11 2. 5. 2 802. 11 f Architecture [...] . 11 2. 5. 3 Operation of 802. 11 f [...] . 13 2. 5. 3. 1 Association [...] 13 2. 5. 3. 2 Ressociation [...] . 13 2. 5. 4 802. 11 f Services Definition [...] 14 2. 5. 5 802. 11 <b>f</b> Packet <b>Format</b> [...] 18 2. 5. 5. 1 General IAPP Packet Format [...] . 18 2. 5. 5. 2 Add-Notify Packet [...] 18 2. 5. 5. 3 Layer 2 Update Frame [...] . 19 2. 5. 5. 4 Move-Notify Packet [...] . 19 2. 5. 5. 5 Move-Response Packet [...] . 20 2. 5. 5. 6 Send-Security-Block Packet [...] . 21 2. 5. 5. 7 ACK-Security-Block Packet [...] 23 Chapter 3 Mobile IPv 4 [...] 24 3. 1 IPv 4 Overview [...] 25 3. 2 New Entities [...] . 25 3. 3 Mobile IP Overview [...] . 27 3. 4 Mobile IP Related Functions [...] 28 3. 4. 1 Agent Discovery [...] 28 3. 4. 2 Registration [...] . 30 3. 4. 3 Tunneling [...] 31 3. 5 Triangle Routing Problem [...] . 33 3. 6 Security Issues [...] 34 3. 7 Handoff Delay and Micro Mobility [...] . 35 3. 7. 1 Cellular IP [...] 36 3. 7. 2 HAWAII [...] . 38 3. 7. 3 Hierarchical Mobile [...] 39 Chapter 4 AAA protocols [...] 41 4. 1 RADIUS Overview [...] 42 4. 1. 1 RADIUS Functionality [...] . 42 4. 1. 2 RADIUS Packet Format [...] . 44 4. 2 Diameter Overview [...] 47 4. 2. 1 Diameter Base Protocol [...] . 47 4. 2. 2 Diameter Packet Format [...] . 49 4. 3 Comparison of RADIUS and Diameter [...] 52 Chapter 5 Architecture of Proposed Model [...] . 56 5. 1 Cooperation of Mobile IP and Diameter [...] 57 5. 2 Home Agent Allocation in Foreign Network [...] . 60 5. 2. 1 Modification of Agent Advertisement [...] 60 5. 2. 2 Home Agent Allocation Procedure [...] 60 5. 3 Regular cooperation of 802. 11 and Mobile IP [...] 62 5. 3. 1 Intra Domain Roaming [...] . 62 5. 3. 2 Inter Domain Roaming [...] . 62 5. 4 Proposed Model [...] . 63 5. 4. 1 Intra Domain Roaming [...] . 63 5. 4. 1. 1 Context Pre-transfer Model [...] . 63 5. 4. 1. 2 Handoff Procedure [...] 64 5. 4. 1. 3 Problems and Discussion [...] 64 5. 4. 2 Inter Domain Roaming [...] . 64 5. 4. 2. 1 Handoff Procedure [...] 65 5. 4. 2. 2 Message Flow with a NHA [...] 67 5. 4. 2. 3 Problems and Discussion [...] 69 5. 5 Multiple Home Agents [...] . 70 5. 6 Handoff Time Comparison [...] 70 Chapter 6 Conclusion and Future Works [...] 73 Reference [...] 7...|$|R
