In this paper, the measurement of the Nu 6 band of atmospheric CFC- 12, an important greenhouse gas, is presented for a cold, clear day in January 1994. A spectrum of the non-CFC- 12 emission features has been simulated using the FASCD 3 P radiation code and measured radiosonde profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity. This has enabled a satisfactory subtraction of the <b>interfering</b> <b>emission</b> features from the CFC- 12 emission spectrum. A comparison of the observed and simulated Nu 6 -bands of CFC- 12 shows good agreement at all frequencies of emission. From these spectra the total downward greenhouse radiative flux from the CFC- 12 Nu 6 emission based for a very cold day has been estimated to be 0. 27 W m – 2 ± 10 %...|$|E

40|$|Microwave ovens may be {{a problem}} for urban ISM-links if a {{line-of-sight}} (LOS) connection is established e. g. to a sidelobe of the receiving link antenna. A link is particularly vulnerable when it is used in cellular voice networks in which corrections {{in the form of a}} retransmission of data – suitable for packet systems carrying data only- would cause unacceptable delays. Typical recorded bit error rate values under interference were as low as 10 - 4 but a loss of synchronization is still the most severe defect. In current ISM links retransmission or bit error corrections would also reduce the user data rate. Observed effects include a loss of timing and overloading of receivers during the oven’s heating cycle. In a real link, the measured relative power levels caused even by distant ovens were some 5 dB above the wanted signal. Even changing the channel does not guarantee transmission due to the limited link bandwidth. The effects of <b>interfering</b> <b>emissions</b> can be reduced by highly directional antennas...|$|R

It focusses on the qualification of flight test instrumentation installed inside research aircraft. Extensive transfer path measurements {{form the basis of}} this work; emphasis is laid on the statistical analysis of measurement data. Qualification is tackled on two fronts. Firstly, a new EMC test procedure is developed to detect potentially <b>interfering</b> <b>emissions</b> from flight test instrumentation on board. It makes use of detection antennas to measure the electromagnetic environment inside the aircraft. The procedure, performed on board, tests the final configuration of the airborne equipment, is faster than similar spectral measurements on the terminals of all relevant aircraft systems and covers the entire frequency bands, whereas conventional tests in many cases have just assessed single isolated frequencies. The substantiation of the method employs the concept of subtracted transfer path firstly introduced in this work. Secondly, the reduction of the coupling to aircraft antennas is evaluated after covering the aircraft interior with electromagnetic absorbing films. Results show that wave scattering is important on the cabin propagation and on the coupling to aircraft antennas. It is also confirmed that energy leaks to the exterior of the fuselage through aircraft doors and windows. Moreover, results indicate that the coupling to aircraft antennas decreases only modestly with absorbing material added to the insulation of aircraft with metallic fuselage...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) is {{a powerful}} light scattering technique {{that can be used}} for sensitive immunoassay development and cell labeling. A major obstacle to using SERS is the complexity of fabricating SERS probes since they require nanoscale characterization and optical uniformity. The light scattering response of SERS probes may also be modulated by the substrate used for SERS analysis. A typical SERS substrate such as quartz can be expensive. Polystyrene is a cheaper substrate option but can decrease the SERS response due to <b>interfering</b> Raman <b>emission</b> peaks and high background fluorescence. The goal of this research is to develop an optimized process for fabricating Raman-labeled nanoparticles for a SERS-based immunoassay on a polystyrene substrate. Results: We have developed a method for fabricating SERS nanoparticle probes for use in a light scattering immunoassay on a polystyrene substrate. The light scattering profile of both spherical gold nanoparticle and gold nanorod SERS probes were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and optical absorbance spectroscopy. The effects of substrate interference and autofluorescence were reduced by selecting a Raman reporter with a strong light scattering response in a spectral region where <b>interfering</b> substrate <b>emission</b> peaks are minimized. Both spherical gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods SERS probes used in the immunoassay were detected at labeling concentrations in the low pM range. This analytical sensitivity falls within the typical dynamic range for direct labeling of cell-surface biomarkers using SERS probes. Conclusion: SERS nanoparticle probes were fabricated to produce a strong light scattering signal despite substrate interference. The optical extinction and inelastic light scattering of these probes was detected by optical absorbance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. This immunoassay demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing strongly enhanced Raman signals on polystyrene, which is an inexpensive yet non-ideal Raman substrate. The assay sensitivity, which is in the low pM range, suggests that these SERS probe particles could be used for Raman labeling of cell or tissue samples in a polystyrene tissue culture plate. With continued development, this approach could be used for direct labeling of multiple cell surface biomarkers on strongly interfering substrate platforms...|$|R

This study, reports on the development of novel yellow colored flame compositions with enhanced spectral performance in terms of luminous intensity, and color quality to standard Russian yellow tracer. The light intensity and the imprint spectra of developed yellow flares were measured using digital luxmeter and UV–Vis. spectrometer respectively. The main giving {{of this study is that}} the light intensity, and color quality of Russian yellow tracer were improved by 287 %, and 170 % respectively.

We assessed these possibilities with eight Wistar rats and two types of reinforcers, food-pellets and sucrose-water, delivered under multiple reinforcement schedules. Ingeneral, lever presses maintained by food-pellets were higher than those maintained by sucrose-water. Haloperidol produced dose-related decreases in lever presses and obtained reinforcers.

The main giving {{of this study is that}} the light intensity of standard NATO red tracer was increased by 72 %, the color quality was also improved by 60 % (over the red band from 650 to 780  nm). This enhanced spectral performance was achieved by means of deriving the combustion process to maximize the formation of red color emitting species in the combustion flame. Thanks to the optimum ratio of color source to color intensifier using aluminum metal fuel; this approach offered the highest intensity and color quality. Upon combustion, aluminum was found to maximize the formation SrCL (the main reactive red color emitting species) and to minimize the <b>interfering</b> incandescent <b>emission</b> resulted from MgO and SrO.

Besides SAM structural characterizations by atomic force microscopy and X-ray reflectivity, we carried out contact angle measurements and applied the Van Oss-Chaudhury-Good theory, which was rarely used previously for self-assembled monolayers. As expected, by increasing the tethered chain length, a higher surface coverage, a higher degree of organization, and a stronger molecular packing were observed. However, it appears to facilitate the self-quenching process, and thus, this strongly affects the fluorescent properties of the SAMs...|$|R

The data have been analyzed to construct a detailed model which reproduces closely the observed pulse structure and polarization angle variations and clearly demonstrates the presence of two <b>interfering</b> cyclotron <b>emission</b> regions located close to the foot points of a closed field line in an offset dipole field distribution. Both emission regions are linearly extended on the white dwarf surface.

The linear bright phase which, in the model corresponds to the phases of visibility of the secondary region, coincides with the X-ray bright phase of the anomalous state of AM Herculis.

40|$|A new and {{sensitive}} molecular probe, 2 -(2 ′-hydroxyphenyl) imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine (HPIP), for monitoring structural changes in lipid bilayers is presented. Migration of HPIP from water into vesicles involves rupture of hydrogen (H) bonds {{with water and}} formation of an internal H bond once the probe is inside the vesicle. These structural changes of the dye allow the occurrence of a photoinduced intramolecular proton-transfer reaction and a subsequent twisting/rotational process upon electronic excitation of the probe. The resulting large Stokes-shifted fluorescence band depends on the twisting motion of the zwitterionic phototautomer and is characterized in vesicles of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine and in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine at the temperature range of interest and {{in the presence of}} cholesterol. Because the fluorescence of aqueous HPIP does not <b>interfere</b> in the <b>emission</b> of the probe within the vesicles, HPIP proton-transfer/twisting motion fluorescence directly allows us to monitor and quantify structural changes within bilayers.

An overview of the trace gas-measurements is presented.

The pollutant emission factors inferred from the measurements are consistent with literature values for fire plumes, confirming that the residential use of biofuels in Asia is a major source of gaseous pollutants to the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, in accord with emission databases.

The present work addresses {{the question whether}} suppression of isoprene <b>emission</b> <b>interferes</b> with genome wide transcription rates and metabolite fluxes in grey poplar (Populusxcanescens) throughout the growing season. Gene expression and metabolite profiles of isoprene emitting wild type plants and RNAi-mediated non-isoprene emitting poplars were compared by using poplar Affymetrix microarrays and non-targeted FT-ICR-MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry). We observed a transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes of phenylpropanoid regulatory and biosynthetic pathways, as well as distinct metabolic down-regulation of condensed tannins and anthocyanins, in non-isoprene emitting genotypes during July, when high temperature and light intensities possibly caused transient drought stress, as indicated by stomatal closure. Under these conditions leaves of non-isoprene emitting plants accumulated hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), a signaling molecule in stress response and negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The absence of isoprene emission under high temperature and light stress resulted transiently in a new chemo(pheno) type with suppressed production of phenolic compounds.

In the present work, a separation of zinc from copper matrices was possible, using the reaction of zinc(II) cation with 1 -(2 -tiazolylazo) - 2 -naphthol (TAN), in the pH range of 6. 5 – 8. 0, resulting in a stable red complex. Copper also reacts with TAN but its interference was avoided {{by the addition of}} ascorbic acid and thiosulphate in the reaction medium. In this way, the aqueous solution was passed through a SEP PAK C 18 cartridge, in which the zinc(II) –TAN complex was quantitatively retained, but it did not occur with copper which passes through the cartridge, as [Cu 2 (S 2 O 3) 2] 2 −, with the aqueous solution.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation was to develop an intrinsic UV and luminescence cure monitoring technique and to provide insight in understanding the cure chemistry of polycyanate resins. UV-visible spectrum of a bisphenol A dicyanate ester (BPADCY) monomer during the cure reaction supported that the cyclotrimerization of cyanate esters to form triazine rings is the principal reaction. ^ A very strong luminescence emission was found during the cure reaction of BPADCY monomer. As the cure reaction proceeded, the fluorescence emission intensity around 420 nm first increased and then decreased accompanied by a small bathochromic shift. Eleven cure related model compounds representing reactants, intermediates and products were chosen, and their UV-Visible and fluorescence behaviors were characterized in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence behavior during cyclotrimerization of a monofunctional cyanate ester was also characterized. The model compound study indicated that the aromatic substituted triazines formed during the cure reaction and their inner filter effect {{were responsible for the}} emission around 420 nm and the observed trend in intensity. Fluorescence emission intensity of polycyanate resins heavily depended upon the measurement temperatures. Both bisphenol A as an impurity in monomer and cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalysts did not <b>interfere</b> with the <b>emission</b> at 420 nm. In situ fluorescence characterization was attempted for the cure reaction of cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalyzed BPADCY system. The phosphorescence emission wavelength of polycyanate resins appeared at about 20 nm longer than that of fluorescence. Phosphorescence lifetime was found to be about 20 ms at room temperature and remained relatively unchanged throughout the cure reaction. ^ FTIR in situ cure kinetics of BPADCY monomer indicated that the cure reaction in air was a little faster than in argon. A linear relationship was found between the consumption rate of cyanate ester groups and the formation rate of substituted triazine rings. ...|$|R

Particularly, miniaturized flow systems aimed for separation of molecules. In such systems, a high light intensity and a rapid development of the emission are the desired reaction characteristics, for reasons discussed in this text. The work tries to {{develop an understanding of}} the chemical processes involved in POCL, with special emphasis to the species favoring or hindering a rapid light evolution. Hence, is the focus placed on the nature of catalysis and the desired properties of substances acting as catalysts in this reaction. Consequently, the scientific papers on which this work is founded includes both systematic stopped-flow studies of catalyst candidates and of the causes for diminished light emission. In addition, multivariate strategies for reaction optimization in practical analysis situations are treated, and the application of the POCL technique to detection of serum-extracted neuroactive steroids, derivatized with fluorescent moieties, is presented. From the experiments in this thesis it is clear nucleophilic catalysts are the most efficient enhancing compounds, which means that they must possess a carefully balanced characteristics of nucleophilicity, leaving group ability, and basicity. The investigations also conclude that the feature of basicity efficiently can be delegated to a non-nucleophilic co-catalyst, which allow the use of nucleophilic catalysts that need to be deprotonated to be active. This thesis also shows the importance of minimizing the amount of competing nucleophiles at the site of reaction to maintain the emission. This implies that also solvents and buffer substances should be carefully chosen not to <b>interfere</b> with the <b>emission</b> process.
