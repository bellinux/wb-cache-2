UniQuest has created over 70 companies from its intellectual property portfolio, and since 2000 UniQuest and its start-ups have raised more than $490million to take university technologies to market. UQ technologies licensed by UniQuest include UQ's cervical cancer vaccine technology, <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> technology in magnetic resonance imaging machines, and the Triple P Positive Parenting Program.|$|E
50|$|PanoTools Plugins:Photoshop, GraphicConverter and GIMP {{plug-ins}} for <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> and remapping. Also compatible to {{many other}} programs that can use Photoshop plug-ins.|$|E
50|$|Preview offers basic <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> tools using Core Image {{processing}} technology {{implemented in}} macOS, {{and other features}} like shape extraction, color extraction, cropping, and rotation tools.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{components}} include <b>image</b> sensor <b>corrections</b> (including [...] "debaying" [...] or {{applying a}} Bayer filter), noise reduction, <b>image</b> scaling, gamma <b>correction,</b> <b>image</b> enhancement, colorspace conversion (between formats such as RGB, YUV or YCbCr), chroma subsampling, framerate conversion, image compression/video compression (such as JPEG), and computer data storage/data transmission.|$|R
50|$|Signal Processing based <b>image</b> {{geometry}} <b>correction</b> is {{the most}} flexible form of this technology, enabling the <b>correction</b> of <b>images</b> that originate from ANY graphics controller platform. The drawback of Signal Processing based <b>Image</b> Geometry <b>Correction</b> is the extra expense of the hardware {{that is used to}} perform it. This extra expense can be mitigated by the inclusion of additional features (such as switching and Edge Blending in the Signal Processing based <b>image</b> geometry <b>correction</b> system).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Image</b> {{geometry}} <b>correction</b> {{is generally}} implemented in 2 different ways: ...|$|R
50|$|The company’s 3Play image {{processing}} systems provide dynamic <b>image</b> <b>correction,</b> image manipulation, and multiplexing and demultiplexing algorithms for transporting 3D high-definition content over conventional high-definition infrastructure channels.|$|E
50|$|Core Image allows programmers {{to easily}} {{leverage}} programmable GPUs for fast image processing for special effects and <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> tools. Some of the included Image Units are Blur, Color Blending, Generator Filters, Distortion Filters, Geometry Filters, Halftone features and much more.|$|E
50|$|To {{address the}} needs for <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> and tomographic {{reconstruction}} in an instrument independent manner, the TomoPy code was developed, which is a parallelizable high performance reconstruction code. The code is in use or planned to be so at most U.S. synchrotron facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Adobe Photoshop Fix is a {{restoration}} and retouching software for <b>image</b> color <b>correction.</b>|$|R
50|$|M Mount Adapter: A mount adapter {{that allows}} {{the use of a}} wide variety of M Mount lenses on the X Mount camera body. It also {{features}} electronic contacts for communicating signals with the camera body and a function button to allow users to easily choose necessary settings and functions (Shoot Without Lens, focal length settings, various <b>image</b> <b>corrections,</b> etc.).|$|R
50|$|Usually, <b>Image</b> {{geometry}} <b>correction</b> {{is applied}} such that equal areas of projection surface are {{perceived by the}} viewer map to equal areas in the source image. It {{can also be used}} to apply a special effect distortion. The term “Image” Geometry Correction, implying a static image, is slightly misleading. <b>Image</b> geometry <b>correction</b> applies to static or dynamic images (i.e. moving video).|$|R
50|$|Digital ICE or Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Correction</b> and Enhancement {{is a set}} of {{technologies}} related to producing an altered image in a variety of frequency spectra. The objective of these technologies is to render an image more usable by Fourier or other filtering techniques. These technologies were most actively advanced in the 1960s and early 1970s in the fields of strategic reconnaissance and medical electronics.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} element of Photoshop, the acceptance of third-party plugins, is useful in <b>image</b> <b>correction.</b> Plugins are needed to create many effects for an image such as color manipulation, insertion of ripples and other effects, and noise reduction. Although Helicon Filter supports many of these 8BF plugins, they are generally not needed due to the program's built-in features such as noise reduction, aberration removal, perspective adjustment, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Adjustment of {{correction}} strength {{based on}} the brightness of direct sunlightA sensor detects the brightness of sunlight, which can fluctuate {{for a variety of}} reasons (season, time of day, location). Correction strength is adjusted based on brightness level, to achieve optimal <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> according to the degree of deterioration in image quality. A rapid response allows adjustments to be made even during repeated and drastic changes in bright sunlight in a short period of time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Image</b> Geometry <b>Correction</b> (often {{referred}} to as Image Warping) {{is the process of}} digitally manipulating image data such that the image’s projection precisely matches a specific projection surface or shape. [...] <b>Image</b> geometry <b>correction</b> compensates for the distortion created by off-axis projector or screen placement or non-flat screen surface, by applying a pre-compensating inverse distortion to that image in the digital domain.|$|R
50|$|Edge Blending is a {{companion}} application to <b>image</b> geometry <b>correction.</b> Edge blending enables the seamless projection {{of a large}} image using several overlapping projectors. Since Keystone Distortion (and frequently the requirement of projection onto a non-flat surface) is a built-in requirement of almost all Edge Blending systems, the pairing of Edge blending and <b>image</b> geometry <b>correction</b> in the same video signal processor is a natural one.|$|R
50|$|The EF 400mm 5.6L USM is Canon's least {{expensive}} 400mm lens {{and one of}} the best deals for a super telephoto 400mm focal length lens in the industry. Exceptional sharpness, minimal vignetting, very low distortion, and superb handling of chromatic aberration means this lens does not require <b>image</b> <b>corrections</b> in digital post production software. Having a maximum aperture of 5.6, it is relatively slow.|$|R

UniQuest has created over 70 companies from its intellectual property portfolio, and since 2000 UniQuest and its start-ups have raised more than $490 million to take university technologies to market.

5000|$|The use of OPC is not {{restricted}} to the low [...] features which are commonly encountered today, but {{can be applied to}} any desired <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> scheme which can be modeled accurately. For example, proximity effect correction in electron beam lithography is included as an automated capability on commercial electron-beam lithography tools. Since many non-lithographic processes exhibit their own proximity effects, e.g., chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etching, these effects can be mixed in with the original OPC.|$|E
50|$|The {{next big}} area to {{research}} regarding this topic {{is to understand}} what processes PGO waves are beneficial for in both states of sleep as well as consciousness. Although PGO waves are noticeably present during NREM sleep, some scientists believe they are also present during waking cycles. There {{is a possibility that}} PGO waves are essential for <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> of the eyes, since PGO waves are signals on a pathway that allow the motor cortex of the brain to interface with the vision system.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon Expeed image/video {{processors}} (often styled EXPEED) are media processors for Nikon's digital cameras. They {{perform a}} large number of tasks: Bayer filtering, demosaicing, image sensor corrections/dark-frame subtraction, image noise reduction, image sharpening, <b>image</b> scaling, gamma <b>correction,</b> <b>image</b> enhancement/Active D-Lighting, colorspace conversion, chroma subsampling, framerate conversion, lens distortion/chromatic aberration <b>correction,</b> <b>image</b> compression/JPEG encoding, video compression, display/video interface driving, digital image editing, face detection, audio processing/compression/encoding and computer data storage/data transmission.|$|R
50|$|Calculation of the <b>image</b> {{geometry}} <b>correction</b> transformationThe <b>image</b> geometry <b>correction</b> transformation can {{be calculated}} by predictive geometry (i.e. calculating exactly where an image should land on a regular surface such as sphere or a cylinder), or by an automatic optical feedback system (i.e. a camera {{can be used to}} evaluate the alignment of test images), or by user iteration (i.e. movement of points by an operator). In all methods, the transformation is generally described as a 2-dimensional array. The number of points in the 2-dimensional array that are required to do an accurate <b>Image</b> Geometry <b>Correction</b> depends on the surface involved. In the case of Keystone Correction, 4 points are all that are required to completely describe any projection situation.|$|R
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} telescopes {{can only}} be used for imaging on static optical tables and do not provide <b>image</b> rotation <b>correction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instrumentation for the 1.0 m {{telescope}} {{includes a}} 2 channel high speed photometer with UBVR and C filters and a CCD photometer with SITe 512x512 pixel illuminated backside thinned CCD and quick change 6 channel filter wheel. These are mounted at the f/11 Cassegrain focus. A high resolution Coude spectrograph exists but is currently not operational. A tip-tilt mechanism on the tertiary mirror is now used for auto-guiding during long exposures {{but will be}} used for full first order <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> when a fast guide camera becomes available.|$|E
50|$|The RIAA {{equalization}} curve (used since 1954) de-emphasizes (weakens) {{the bass}} notes during recording, allowing closer spacing of record grooves and hence more playing time. It also boosts the high frequencies so the playback mirror <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> reduces surface noise. On playback, the turntable cartridge pre-amplifier reverses the RIAA curve to flatten out the frequencies again restoring the bass notes to normal {{and reducing the}} high frequencies to normal while reducing the inherent background hiss produced by the stylus contacting an imperfect vinyl surface. The net effect of RIAA equalization is to allow longer playing time and lower background noise while maintaining full fidelity of music or other content.|$|E
50|$|Astrotech Corporation was {{established}} in 1984. Prior to 2009, it was known as SPACEHAB, Inc., a company that provided space habitat microgravity experimentation equipment and services to NASA during the Space Shuttle era. As the Shuttle program came to an end, the company put more focus on its spacecraft processing business, Astrotech Space Operations, Inc. (ASO), its mass spectrometer instrumentation business, 1st Detect, Inc. and its microgravity vaccine development company, Astrogenetix, Inc. In August 2014, the company sold Astrotech Space Operations. In February 2015, the company acquired defect correction software and Astral Images Corp. was created to commercialize government funded satellite imagery processing technology and research into automated <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> and enhancement.|$|E

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{histogram}} metrics are {{correlated with}} clinical parameters in cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD). Whether ADC histogram parameters derived from simple diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can provide relevant markers for long term studies of cSVD remains unknown. CADASIL patients {{were evaluated by}} DWI and DTI in a large cohort study over a 6 -year period. ADC histogram parameters were compared to those derived from mean diffusivity (MD) histograms in 280 patients using intra-class correlation and Bland-Altman plots. Impact of <b>image</b> <b>corrections</b> applied to ADC maps was assessed and a mixed effect model was used for analyzing the effects of scanner upgrades. The results showed that ADC histogram parameters are strongly correlated to MD histogram parameters and that <b>image</b> <b>corrections</b> have only limited influence on these results. Unexpectedly, scanner upgrades {{were found to have}} major effects on diffusion measures with DWI or DTI that can be even larger than those related to patients' characteristics. These data support that ADC histograms from daily used DWI can provide relevant parameters for assessing cSVD, but the variability related to scanner upgrades as regularly performed in clinical centers should be determined precisely for longitudinal and multicentric studies using diffusion MRI in cSVD...|$|R
5000|$|Lenses {{have already}} {{appeared}} whose image quality {{would have been}} marginal or unacceptable in the film era, but are acceptable in the digital era because the cameras {{for which they are}} intended automatically correct their defects. For example, onboard automatic software <b>image</b> <b>correction</b> is a standard feature of 2008's Micro Four Thirds digital format. Images from the 2009 Panasonic 14-140mm f/4-5.8 G VARIO ASPH. MEGA O.I.S. and the 2010 Olympus M. Zuiko Digital 14-150mm f/4-5.6 ED lenses (both Japan) have their severe barrel distortion at the wide angle settings automatically reduced by a Panasonic LUMIX DMC-GH1 and Olympus Pen E-P2, respectively. The Panasonic 14-140mm lens also has its chromatic aberration corrected. (Olympus has not yet implemented chromatic aberration correction.) ...|$|E

30|$|The sensing {{signal from}} the bimorph scanner was {{connected}} to one AI channel, {{which could be used}} in the real-time <b>image</b> distortion <b>correction</b> [43]. Scan control and data acquisition processes were set to run synchronously in a homemade program, which was the key issue to realize real-time imaging. In order to improve the program efficiency, the data collected by the DAQ system was added to a queue and then read by the display module for imaging. The real-time processes, such as the <b>image</b> distortion <b>correction</b> of both deflection and friction channels, were set up to run in parallel.|$|R
40|$|Fully {{two-dimensional}} gamma-ray imaging with simultaneous {{high-resolution spectroscopy}} {{has been demonstrated}} using an externally segmented germanium sensor. The system employs a single high-purity coaxial detector with its outer electrode segmented into 5 distinct charge collection regions and a lead coded aperture with a uniformly redundant array (URA) pattern. A series of one-dimensional responses was collected around 511 keV while the system was rotated in steps through 180 degrees. A non-negative, linear least-squares algorithm was then employed to reconstruct a 2 -dimensional <b>image.</b> <b>Corrections</b> for multiple scattering in the detector, and the finite distance of source and detector {{are made in the}} reconstruction process...|$|R
