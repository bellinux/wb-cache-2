5000|$|... 5 Aerial Ladder Platforms (ALP): <b>extendable</b> <b>ladder</b> {{platforms}} with rescue cages, stretchers {{and additional}} lighting, these vehicles provide high-level access and firefighting capability, with a vertical reach of almost 100 ft, almost 80 ft sideways, {{and up to}} 55 ft below ground level. They are based at Chelmsford, Colchester, Grays, Harlow and Southend-on-Sea.|$|E
50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen lift frame and hydraulics. When vertical, the rocket was {{suspended}} above the firing stand, which {{was raised to}} touch the rocket fins. Clamping collars were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section <b>extendable</b> <b>ladder,</b> the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{modelled}} on the Dublin Society {{for improving}} Husbandry, Manufacturers and other Useful Arts, the RSA, from its foundation, offered prizes through a Premium Award Scheme that continued for 100 years. Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded {{to individuals who}} achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an <b>extendable</b> <b>ladder</b> to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists i.e. Edwin Landseer who {{at the age of}} 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, means of {{reaching}} tall structures were devised. At first, manually <b>extendable</b> <b>ladders</b> were used; as these grew in length (and weight), {{they were put}} onto two large wheels. When carried by fire engines these wheeled escape ladders had the wheels suspended behind {{the rear of the}} vehicle, making them a distinctive sight. Before long, turntable ladders — which were even longer, mechanically extendable, and installed directly onto fire trucks — made their appearances.|$|R
5000|$|Bront: The {{tough guy}} of the team, {{as he is}} the strongest of the Protectons. Before his {{transfer}} to the body called the R-1500. He maintained Zanadon's command center and initiated its battle mode. He's close friends with Jerrok, who often teased {{him in the past}} because of his meager size. Their trust was strained when Bront was wrongly accused of sabotaging Zanadon's reactor and almost attacked Kontor and Jerrok, but their partnership was soon reestablished. His Robotix form has a humanoid body from the waist up, and his four legs have wheels as feet. Memorable transformations and features include a car-like form with deployable grabber, an extreme extension of his torso to form a <b>ladder,</b> <b>extendable</b> legs for river crossing, a deployable twin laser cannon of his forehead, and hands combining into a drill-like form.

50|$|The Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle (1142) {{issued in}} May 1967 was {{also based on}} the Ford H Series tractor unit, and {{featured}} twin boom die-cast recovery cranes with hooks attached to cotton lines that could be extended by winding a pair of spare wheels attached {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, and also included were two model mechanics previously seen with the 'Express Services' truck. The American LaFrance Aerial Rescue Truck (1143) was added to the Major range in October 1968 and was a highly detailed model of a tiller/ladder truck (or hook and ladder) from the United States of America. It featured an <b>extendable</b> <b>ladder</b> on a rotating base complete with plastic ladder extensions and model firemen and has recently been re-issued by the modern Corgi company in a number of authentic liveries. The Carrimore Car Transporter Mark IV using the recently introduced Scammell cab was also released in April 1969 and a gift set (GS48) featuring the new transporter and six cars; MGC GT (345), Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1967 (339), Sunbeam Imp Monte Carlo 1967 (340), Mini Cooper S Magnifique (334), Morris Mini Minor (226) and The Saint's Volvo P1800 (258) soon followed. By October 1970 the Carrimore Car Transporter Mark V (1146) had grown to three decks and Gift Set 20 again featured the transporter complete with six cars now fitted with Whizzwheels; Lancia Fulvia Zagato (372), Marcos 3 Litre (377), MGC GT (378), Ford Capri 3 Litre (311), The Saint's Volvo P1800 (201) and Pontiac Firebird (343). The colour schemes applied to some cars in the Car Transporter Gift Sets were unique to models included in these sets, such as the MGC GT (345) finished in orange, and today are particularly collectable. The Scammell Handyman Ferrymasters Truck (1147) issued in December 1969, proved to be the last new application for the Scammell cab and was finished in the authentic yellow and white livery of the Ferrymasters haulage company.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{project has}} been done in direct collaboration with Autokaross i Floby AB Rescue Vehicle Department, in Sweden.   The report contains the design development of a protective cover against weather conditions for the <b>extendable</b> <b>ladder</b> in a fire vehicle.   The aim of the report has been to develop a functional and low cost solution cover for the FEL on a fire truck, which is allocated on the roof, with the express intention of providing adequate access and protection against weather conditions in Nordic countries, so as to prevent premature deterioration of the FEL unit. The company has set the technical and conceptual boundaries, {{with the help of the}} two previous concepts currently used, the BMC and the ACP.   The initial requirements laid out by the company were expressed through a number of specific demands which can be categorized in two main points:   Cost: Designing a solution keeping in mind cost limits, assembly cost and time, and space optimization. This was done by taking into account the two existing solutions, particularly the BMC, which represents the lowest, cost wise and function wise. Therefore it was used as the basis on which to apply improvements, rather than trying to lower the high cost on the overqualified function of the ACP.   Function: Providing the adequate protection and access to the FEL. In this case, the problem was solved by establishing the correct degree of protection relevant to the Nordic weather conditions and FEL needs, and regarding the access, this was assured by fully automating the opening/closing process with the existing extraction operating system of the FEL.     The result of this report is a concept solution which meets the company’s demands, obtained by creative detailing, together with an analysis regarding possible considerations that could improve the creative detailing result in this report in the form of future work.     The report documents the process that has taken place in exploration, concept generation, concept evaluation, concept selection, and detailed CAD development. Each section shows the requirements and adjustments taken to fulfil the company’s needs. ...|$|E
