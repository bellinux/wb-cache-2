25|$|According to the Ukrainian constitution, {{access to}} free {{education}} is granted to all citizens. Complete <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> is compulsory {{in the state}} schools which constitute the overwhelming majority. Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis. There is also {{a small number of}} accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.|$|E
25|$|Education is {{compulsory}} {{from the}} age of 7 to 13. Pre-school education for children between three and six years of age is optional and in its early stages. There are five levels of education: pre-school, elemental and complementary basic education, general and complementary secondary education, <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> technical and professional teaching, and higher education (university and non-universities). Basic education is under reform, and now forms a single cycle, comprising 6 years of education. Secondary education is widely available and there are two cycles (7th to 9th classe and 10th to 11th classe). Professional education in public institutions is nonoperational, however private school offerings opened, including the Centro de Formação São João Bosco (since 2004) and the Centro de Formação Luís Inácio Lula da Silva (since 2011).|$|E
25|$|There is some pre-primary {{education}} for children aged 4 to 6 years but provision is patchy. Primary school education has two cycles from age 7 to 10 years (grades 1 to 4) and from age 11 to 14 years (grades 5 to 8). Regional exams are {{taken at the}} end of grade 8 (Primary school certificate exam). Secondary education has two cycles from age 15 to 16 years (grades 9 and 10) and from age 17 to 18 years (grades 11 to 12) leading up to the national exams. The Ethiopian <b>General</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> Certificate Examination (EGSECE) is taken {{at the end of}} grade 10 and requires a pass in at least 5 subjects to pass to the next level. The Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination (EHEEE) is taken at the end of grade 12. Students passing the EHEEE are eligible for university if their grades are sufficiently high.|$|E
50|$|In the {{remaining}} subjects, only oral examinations are held. Written examination questions {{are produced by}} the Ministry of Education's Department of <b>General</b> Upper <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education.</b> For each subject, there is an examination committee consisting of hand- picked teachers and the Department's subject advisers for the subject in question. Oral examinations are held in subjects selected (at random) by the Department of <b>General</b> Upper <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> for each individual school.|$|R

25|$|Achimota College was {{therefore}} established {{as part of}} Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. James Aggrey {{who was in the}} Gold Coast {{as a member of the}} Phelps Stokes Fund's African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir Emmanuel Mate Kole, Konor of Manya Krobo; Nana Sir Ofori Atta, Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of Anomabo, as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio, the Hon. F. V. Nanka-Bruce, both of Accra; the Hon. Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr. of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of Cape Coast, and the Hon. J. E.

2500|$|Another {{system that}} runs in {{parallel}} with the public educational system {{is known as the}} Al-Azhar system. It consists of [...] six years of primary stage, a three-year preparatory stage and finally three years of secondary stage. The Ministry of education reduced the number of secondary school years from four to three years in 1998, so as to align the Al Azhar system with the <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> system. [...] In this system as well, there are separate schools for girls and boys. Al Azhar education system is supervised by the Supreme Council of the Al-Azhar Institution. The Azhar Institution itself is nominally independent from the Ministry of Education, but is ultimately under supervision by the Egyptian Prime Minister.Al Azhar schools are named [...] "Institutes" [...] and include primary, preparatory, and secondary phases.All schools in all stages teach religious subjects and non-religious subjects, to a certain degree- not as intensively as the state schools. The bulk of the curriculum, however, consists of religious subjects as described below. All the students are Muslims. Al-Azhar schools are all over the country, especially in rural areas. The graduates of Al-Azhar secondary schools are eligible to continue their studies at the Al-Azhar University. [...] As of 2007 and 2008, there are 8272 Al-Azhar schools in Egypt. In the early 2000s, Al-Azhar schools accounted for less than 4% of the total enrollment. The graduates of this system [...] are then automatically accepted into Al-Azhar University.In 2007, the Pre-University enrollment in Al- Azhar institutes is about 1,906,290 students.|$|E
