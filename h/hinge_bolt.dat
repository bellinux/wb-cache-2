On a flight from Hawaii to Burbank, California, the stewardess complained of a vibration that was rattling the dishes and silverware {{at the rear of the}} plane. Gann inspected the tail compartment and noticed nothing amiss. The vibration was later traced to a missing elevator <b>hinge</b> <b>bolt,</b> which could have led to aerodynamic unporting and a loss of control. However, Gann was eager to begin his vacation the next day and flew at a higher than expected airspeed, holding the elevator in place.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} test flights, the {{helicopter}} was transferred to Schiphol in 1926, where B. Grass and later Peter J. Six acted as test pilots. The British contest had been cancelled due to a fatal accident in England, but von Baumhauer continued the experiments until 1930. Several improvements were made, with the flights also getting better, although they often still had a somewhat indefinite direction. On 28 August 1930, von Baumhauer himself made a half-hour flight. The next day, a <b>hinge</b> <b>bolt</b> {{of one of the}} rotor blades failed due to a fatigue crack, and the helicopter fell to the ground. The helicopter was completely destroyed, but von Baumhauer was unharmed. Since the money had almost run out, the machine was not rebuilt, but Von Baumhauer's interest in helicopter development continued until the end of his life.|$|E

5000|$|The Madsen has {{a rather}} {{sophisticated}} and unique operating cycle. The machine gun uses a mixed recoil-operated locking {{system with a}} <b>hinged</b> <b>bolt</b> that is patterned after the lever-action Peabody Martini breechblock. The recoil operation is part short and part long recoil. After firing a round to start the open bolt firing cycle, the initial recoil impulse drives the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt to the rear. A pin {{on the right side}} of the bolt moves backward in grooves in an operating cam plate mounted to the right side of the receiver. After 12.7 mm of travel, the bolt is cammed upward, away from the breech (the [...] "short" [...] portion of the recoil system). The barrel and barrel extension continue to move rearward to a point slightly exceeding the combined overall length of the cartridge case and projectile (the long portion of the recoil system, responsible for the weapon's low rate of fire).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{noise and}} {{vibration}} signatures of automotive passenger cabins contribute substantially towards the overall impression of the vehicle quality and therefore have a great influence on the buying decision of the customer. Because the time to market is constantly decreasing while the pressure to save costs is increasing, NVH engineers seek to define and optimize a vehicle’s vibration and acoustic comfort characteristics as early as possible. This paper describes {{the development of a}} predictive finite element acoustic-structural analysis tool to investigate the interior noise level. The ABAQUS/Standard finite element code has been employed to quantify the noise generating behavior of a typical door <b>hinge</b> <b>bolted</b> to a simplified, scaled-down vehicle model. Actual in-service conditions in terms of loading, complex contact, friction and damping phenomena have been considered. The validity of the developed numerical model is also experimentally verified based on frequency response functions, the results of which are presented in this paper. Comparative analysis between the simulated ABAQUS and experimental results shows good agreement. This proves that the developed numerical model is functional and reliable. The results further demonstrate that this particular door hinge and vehicle model configuration is most sensitive around 188. 6 Hz. The insights gained into the noise generation and transmission behavior of the system under investigation may be materialized into realistic design modifications enabling NVH engineers to mover closer towards cabin acoustic refinement in pursuit of their quest for quieter passenger cabins...|$|R

50|$|The Daihatsu Naked was a Kei car made by Daihatsu.Presented on the Tokyo Motor Show in 1999, it {{was built}} between 2000 and 2004. It was {{available}} with a 659cc petrol engine and either two or four wheel drive. The styling included features such as ridges in the doors and exposed <b>hinges</b> and <b>bolts,</b> designed to make the car appear rugged. The Naked was an early example of styling features from off-roaders being used on road cars; this idea has since been used on cars such as the Rover Streetwise, Citroën C3 XTR and Volkswagen CrossPolo. The interior styling has similarities {{to that of the}} original Fiat Panda, with plastic mouldings that resemble the fabric on the Panda's dashboard.|$|R
50|$|Because {{there were}} five prototypes, it is not {{possible}} to give a description applying to all of them in detail. Weighing about fifty-five tons, the general AMX 50 project was the heaviest of a trio of French AFV designs of the postwar period (the others being the AMX 13 and the Panhard EBR) to feature an oscillating turret. The oscillating turret design, lacking a conventional gun-mantlet, is in two separate parts, with an upper and lower part connected by two <b>hinge</b> <b>bolts</b> or pivots, the gun being fixed within the upper section. The horizontal movement of the gun, traversing, is conventional, but the vertical movement, elevation, is achieved through the pivoting of the entire upper section with respect to the lower section, which holds the lower sides of the upper section within its trunnions. This method of elevation has two main advantages. Firstly it allows for a smaller turret volume, as no internal space is needed for the vertical movement of the gun breech. Secondly, it allows the use of a relatively simple semi-automatic auto-loader fed by multiround magazines, achieving a very high rate of fire for as long as the magazines were loaded, as the gun is also fixed with respect to the auto-loader located in the back of the upper turret, i.c. a protruding bustle. The automatic loading system worked satisfactorily when the calibre was 100 mm. After the larger 120 mm gun was introduced, reliability suffered, due to the increased weight of the rounds used. The oscillating turret was a very fashionable concept in the 1950s, and also applied in some American projects, such as the T57 and T58. Only the French however, would produce operational systems, having pioneered the concept.|$|R

50|$|The JM mount {{consisted}} of a thick, metal, square frame, sized {{to fit into a}} standard French fortification embrasure (opening); the guns were mounted on an equally heavy-duty pivoting cradle inside this frame. The square frame fit snugly into the embrasure and was attached by <b>hinges</b> and <b>bolts.</b> This ensured that there were no gaps where enemy bullets could enter into the bunker (except the very small opening that the telescopic sight peeped through), yet allowed the guns to be aimed and trained on anyone outside the walls. Emplacements were often shared with an anti-tank gun sharing the same embrasure opening; the JM mount would be hinged back, and the anti-tank gun slid forward on its ceiling-mounted rail, until its barrel was outside and breech inside. It was surrounded by a similar square frame, which fit tightly into the embrasure. The only time the occupants of the bunker were exposed to enemy fire, was in the brief moments when switching the machine gun mounting for an artillery mount.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{work began}} once the main structure was complete. John Phillips was {{employed as a}} carpenter for the Library's floors, windows and bookcases. Joseph Artari was chosen to be the project's plasterer, employing Charles Stanley and Thomas Toberts alongside him. In March 1745, the Trustees intervened to help ensure no work was proceeding by candlelight as the Library neared completion. A portrait of Radcliffe was sent to John Michael Rysbrack, who was tasked with creating a six-feet tall marble statue of the Library's benefactor. It was installed by Townesend and Smith. The responsibility for the ironwork for the gates for the seven exterior arches of the library was given to Robert Bakewell of Derby. His original estimate proved too low, however, explained by Gibbs to {{be a result of}} the French war. It eventually cost £364. The Trustee's meeting of 13 March 1746 reveals that the remaining work consisted of the paving of the library inside and out, the staircase rail, and the locks, <b>hinges</b> and <b>bolts</b> for the bookcases.|$|R

The protruding rear part of the bolt carrier assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the bolt carrier assembly slide channel. A cartridge extractor with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the bolt carrier assembly.

50|$|The M82 is a short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} firearm. When {{the gun is}} fired, {{the barrel}} initially recoils for a short distance (about 1 in), while being securely locked by the rotating bolt. After the short travel lower part of acclerater arm held by receiver upper part is already <b>hinged</b> in <b>bolt</b> carrier and the middle portion strikes {{it back to the}} barrel by a rod place in bolt carrier transferring part of the recoil energy of the barrel to the bolt to achieve reliable cycling and unlock it from barrel.The bolt is unlocked by turning in the curved cam track in the bolt carrier.Then, the barrel is stopped By the combined effect of the accelerater, buffer spring and the muzzle braker and the bolt continues back, to extract and eject a spent case. On its return stroke, the bolt strips the fresh cartridge from the box magazine and feeds it into the chamber and finally locks itself to the barrel. The striker is also cocked on the return stroke of the bolt. The gun is fed from a large, detachable box magazine holding up to 10 rounds, although a rare 12-round magazine was developed for use during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{are often}} {{designed}} with numbers determined by testing in a lab, {{rather than by}} repeatedly building prototypes. These lab tests conform to testing specifications so that the numbers can be compared between manufacturers, suppliers, and lab technicians. One such specification is ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08), and {{it is used to}} determine important properties of a bearing pin joint like <b>hinges,</b> <b>bolt</b> holes, and rivet joints. The properties determined from this fastener-through-plate method are bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. Adhering to the methods outlined in ASTM E 238, a study was performed, looking at the effects that plate material, fastener used, fastener lubrication, and plate hole preparation method (whether drilled and reamed or just drilled) have on the three bearing joint properties. The plate materials used were Al 7050 – T 7451, Ti – 6 Al – 4 V (mill annealed), and PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000. The fasteners were Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws, coated A 286 screws, and high speed steel (HSS) pins used as a control. Lubrication was tested using a corrosion inhibitor, PR – 1776 M B – 2 from PRC – DeSoto, on the fastener or leaving the fastener uncoated. The HSS pins were always tested in the uncoated condition. 54 runs were performed, as outlined by a D-optimal design of experiment. It was discovered from the statistical analysis of the results via ANOVA that both the plate material used and the pin material, whether a screw or a pin, had a significant effect on the bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. The interaction between the two factors was also significant on all responses but the bearing stiffness. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 plates seemed to perform best on average, followed by Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates, then Al 7050 – T 7451 plates. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 and Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates had similar bearing strength and bearing yield strength averages with the HSS control pins being used, which had the highest mean values for a given plate and fastener. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V and A 286 screws behaved and performed statistically similar in most cases, except when hole preparation method was take into account. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws performed better when the hole was drilled and reamed, while the coated A 286 screws performed better when the hole was drilled only. All screws had lower resulting bearing properties than the HSS control pins. It was also found that ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08) is a precise test method, since the method could be performed repeatably and reliably with no missing data points. Therefore, this ASTM testing method is reasonable for determining bearing properties, which can then be used to design aircraft...|$|R
