5|$|Several {{studies of}} diets {{supplemented}} with MFGM and its components, including gangliosides and sphingomyelin, {{have aimed to}} address measures of cognitive development in pediatric populations. In some of the studies, MFGM supplementation to <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> was shown to narrow the gap in cognitive development between breastfed and formula-fed infants.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and {{can be added to}} <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> or other nutritional products.|$|E
40|$|Soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> {{have been}} {{available}} for nearly one hundred years and more than 20 million American infants have been fed soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> since the 1970 s. Currently, soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> account for approximately 25 percent of the formulas marketed in the United States. Although the present recommendations for soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> used in the United States are likely still valid, the public health significance of the safety of soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> receives {{a great deal of}} attention. Infants fed with soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> are exposed to substantial levels of soy isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens with potential hormonal activity due to their chemical similarity to endogenous estrogen. Isoflavones possess weak estrogenic activity and could theoretically negatively affect endocrine development. This has led researchers to study the health effects of isoflavones in soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> on thyroid functions. This literature review discusses previous animal and human studies and provides suggestions for further studies in the research of isoflavones in soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> and effects on thyroid function...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guidance}} note is to provide competent authorities, <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> and followon formulae manufacturers and retailers with guidance on {{the implementation of the}} legislation governing the composition and marketing of <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> and follow-on formulae as provided for in the European Communities (<b>Infant</b> <b>Formulae</b> and Follow-on Formulae) Regulations 2007 and 2009. The principal purpose of the legislation and this guidance note is to contribute to the health of infants, bearing in mind that the encouragement and protection of breastfeeding is an important aspect of health care. It takes account of international discussions, in particular, those in Codex Alimentarius in relation to the timing of the introduction of complementary foods into the diet of infants. For the most part, the EU and national legislation is self explanatory. This guidance note focuses on key areas of the legislation where advice is required: • Marketing requirements including labelling, presentation, advertising and promotion of <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> and follow-on formulae • Notification of <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> • Export of <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> and follow-on formulae to Third Countrie...|$|R

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E

40|$|<b>Infant</b> <b>formulae</b> are {{the only}} {{alternatives}} to breast milk for infants {{who are unable to}} continue breastfeeding through the first year of life. They aim to provide formula-fed infants with the same structural and functional benefits observed in breastfed infants. To achieve this, bioactive nutrients have been added to <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> in recent years: long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for neurodevelopment; probiotics and pre-biotics for local gastrointestinal defence; and nucleotides for promoting the immune response. Changes in protein quantity and quality allow <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> to achieve a balance between providing the correct plasma amino acid profile and reducing the protein intake, which could prevent obesity in later life. Hydrolysed proteins may help prevent atopic disorders.

40|$|Milk lipids supply {{most of the}} {{calories}} necessary for newborn growth in maternal milk or <b>infant</b> <b>formulas.</b> The chemical composition of <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> has been optimized but not {{the structure of the}} emulsion. There is still a major difference between the native emulsions of milk fat globules and processed submicronic emulsions in <b>infant</b> <b>formulas.</b> This difference may modify the kinetics of digestion of emulsions in newborns and influence lipid metabolism. To check this, semi-dynamic gastric in vitro digestions were conducted on three matrices: a standardized milk emulsion containing native milk fat globules referred to as minimally-processed emulsion and two processed model <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> (homogenized or homogenized/pasteurized). Gastric conditions mimicked those reported in newborns. The minimally-processed emulsion was lipolysed and proteolysed slower than processed formulas. The difference in initial structure persisted during digestion.

40|$|Cereals {{products}} enriched with leguminous or oleaginous {{are used}} in Burkina Faso as food complement or to avoid <b>infant</b> malnutrition. <b>Infant</b> <b>formulas</b> from cereals are consumed as food supplements after the weaning age. They are produced in Burkina Faso {{with a mixture of}} several cereals (maize, millet, rice, or sorghum), leguminous (bean), oleaginous (peanut, soya or sesame), sugar or salt and sometimes milk powder. The production is artisanal or semi-industrial. These infant foods from cereals should be free from mycotoxins and pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this work was to determine the occurrence of mycotoxins like aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and fumonisins in <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> and grains in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). The mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and fumonisins) were determined by HPLC-FLD in 248 samples of <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> produced by the Recovery and Nutrition Education Centers (CRENs) and sold on the market places in Burkina Faso. Results showed that the majority of samples of <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> presented high levels of mycotoxins. The frequency of contaminated samples by aflatoxin B 1, ochratoxin A and fumonisins in analyzed samples were 83. 9 % (167 / 199), 7. 5 % (15 / 199) and 1. 5 % (3 / 199), respectively. The highest values registered in <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> were 900, 6 and 3 times higher for aflatoxin B 1 (EU limit: 0. 1 μg/kg), ochratoxin A (EU limit: 0. 5 μg/kg) and fumonisins (EU limit: 200 μg/kg), respectively, than the EU regulation limits (1881 / 2006).
