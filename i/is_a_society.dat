25|$|A benefit society, fraternal benefit {{society or}} fraternal benefit order <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>society,</b> an {{organization}} or a voluntary association formed to provide mutual aid, benefit, for instance insurance for relief from sundry difficulties.

Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, like social {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering [...] "how <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E

It states: [...] "Clara Moore <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> girl who has won the affections of Jack Cass, a young millionaire. He thinks she loves him, but it is really his money that she adores. Prompted by a letter of warning, Jack decides to prove his sweetheart's love. One reason is that he privately disapproves of the way Clara and her mother have treated a poor relation, an orphan girl, who has been left in their care. Instead of giving her a home, they make a servant of her. Jack's plot works like a charm. His faithful valet gives the newspapers {{the story of the}} failure of Jack's mind, and that young man's ruin. Clara reads it and when Jack calls and admits that the reports are correct, she returns his ring and says that all is over between them. In fact {{the only person in the}} house that shows any sympathy for Jack is the poor relation, May Dustin, and naturally he compares her with the heartless society girl. Jack wants to see more of May, and invents a unique way of doing so. He buys out the milkman who serves the family, and in that way is able to call on May everyday. Liking soon ripens into love, and May agrees to wed Jack, although thinking he has nothing in the world but a meager salary. After marriage she is told the truth and finds that her husband has money enough to supply her every wish. As for Clara, she has lost her only chance to win a prized millionaire." ...|$|E
