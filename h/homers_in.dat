5|$|The {{first player}} born in Puerto Rico {{who played in}} MLB was Hiram Bithorn, who debuted as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs on April 15, 1942. This was {{followed}} by the introduction of African American players in Major League Baseball, which allowed more chances to players born in the island. Subsequently, Afro-Puerto Rican players such as Orlando Cepeda and Victor Pellot Power began having solid performances in the league, and were selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In , Roberto Clemente became the first player from Puerto Rico and first Latin American to be elected {{as a member of the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Since then Puerto Rico has kept a stable amount of players in the league. During this timeframe, several players have been selected to participate in the All-Star Game or won awards for their performance, while others imposed records within the league. These include Javy López, who holds the record for most home runs hit by a catcher in a single season. Both Iván Rodríguez and Roberto Alomar hold the record for most Gold Glove Awards in their positions. Recipients of the Most Valuable Player Award include Orlando Cepeda, Juan González and Iván Rodríguez. Roberto Clemente and Mike Lowell also won the World Series MVP Award in their respective divisions. Carlos Delgado is the only Latin to hit 4 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> a game.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Cruz and Ian Kinsler {{became the}} first two {{teammates}} in major league history to <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> {{each of the first}} three games in a season, joining Dean Palmer (1992) as the only Texas ballplayers to ever <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> the first three games of the season.

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on September 9 and smacked the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-1. Juan Uribe went had 4 hits, including 3 home runs, in 4 at-bats.

The team won again the next night, as Scott Van Slyke hit a pinch hit walk-off {{home run in the}} 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 5-3 win. This was the team's first walk off homer by a pinch hitter since Olmedo Sáenz in 2007. Patrick Corbin kept the Dodgers offense in check the next day and the Diamondbacks won 4-1.

Madison Bumgarner out pitched Kershaw as the Giants won the next game, 4-2. The Giants pounded the Dodgers 19-3 on September 15. The 19 runs was the most ever scored by one team at Dodger Stadium, the most allowed by the Dodgers in a game since May 5, 2001, at Chicago, and the worst Dodger home defeat since a July 3, 1947, loss to the Giants in Brooklyn. Hunter Pence hit two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the Giants 4-3 win in the series finale. He hit five homeruns in total in the four game series, the first Giant to accomplish that feat against the Dodgers since Willie Mays.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, Carlos Peña hit a {{home run}} for the sixth {{consecutive}} game. This broke the team record for <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> consecutive games, set by Jose Canseco, who went deep in five straight games during the 1999 season. Peña's streak was snapped the next day, going hitless in four at-bats.

25|$|In {{the second}} game, Zack Greinke allowed two solo <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the second but went seven innings {{with only the}} two runs. The Dodgers came from behind with four runs in the seventh {{to win the game}} 5–2 and even the series up.

25|$|Afterward, the Astros {{would have}} three tough seasons. They would trade César Cedeño to Cincinnati for Ray Knight and Danny Heep to the Mets for Mike Scott. In the process, Bill Virdon {{was fired in}} favor of Bob Lillis. During this time, Dickie Thon was {{emerging}} as a premier shortstop, hitting 20 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1983. But in April 1984, he was beaned by Mike Torrez. That would remove any chances for Thon of becoming a big-time shortstop.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{loading the}} bases {{in both the}} first and second innings, the Braves were unable to score a run and {{surrendered}} five runs in those first two innings in a 7-2 loss in the first of three games against the Giants. A three-run homer by Kemp in the fourth inning and one run surrendered in 7 2/3rd innings pitched by Foltynewicz was enough to secure a 3-1 win for the Braves in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the series by surrendering four <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> a 13-4 loss to the Giants.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 1932, Lou Gehrig hit four <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> one game.

A's slugger Jimmie Foxx was also known for {{tape-measure}} blasts, especially during 1932 when he hit 58 home runs and challenged Ruth's season record of 60. Foxx was the all-time home run hitter at Shibe Park, with 195 round-trippers between 1927 and 1945.|$|E

25|$|The stadium {{hosted the}} 1941, 1951 and 1971 MLB All-Star Games. All three games {{featured}} home runs. Ted Williams won the 1941 game with an upper deck shot. The ball was also carrying {{well in the}} 1951 and 1971 games. Of the many <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> those games, the most often replayed is Reggie Jackson's drive to right field that hit so {{high up in the}} light tower that the TV camera lost sight of it, until it dropped to the field below. Jackson dropped his bat and watched it sail, seemingly astonished at his own power display.|$|E
25|$|The derby {{consists}} of three rounds in which players attempt to hit as many home runs as possible. Each round lasts four minutes, and outs (misses, foul balls, etc.) do not count against players. All six sluggers participate {{in the first round}}.

The top two hitters after the second round advance to the final round. With home run totals reset, the player who hits the most <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the final round is declared champion and is awarded a championship belt. Any ties are broken with 90-second tiebreaker rounds.|$|E
25|$|Greenberg {{was again}} voted to the AL All-Star roster in 1938, {{but because he}} was not named to the 1935 AL All-Star roster and was benched in the 1937 game, he {{declined}} to accept a starting position on the 1938 AL team and did not play (NL won 4-1). He led the league in runs scored (144) and at-bats per home run (9.6), tied for the AL lead in walks (119), was second in RBIs (146), slugging percentage (.683), and total bases (380), and third in OBP (.438) and set a still-standing major league record of 39 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> his home park, the newly reconfigured Briggs Stadium.
