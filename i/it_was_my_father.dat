2500|$|Michael Majerus's 1998 book [...] is an {{adaptation}} of Kettlewell's The Evolution of Melanism, which discussed criticisms of Kettlewell's original experimental methods. When the biologist Jerry Coyne reviewed this book in Nature, he stated that the most serious problem was that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks. He also wrote that the white moths had increased in numbers before the lichen had returned and that Kettlewell's findings of moths choosing matching backgrounds had not been replicated in later experiments. Coyne compared his reaction to [...] "the dismay attending my discovery, {{at the age of}} 6, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve". He concluded that [...] "for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom" [...] and that further studies of the animal's habits were needed.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered a}} room. In {{a moment the}} deputy brought in a man dressed in striped clothing, and with his hair cut close. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{he had to}} reply. [...] "I {{remember}} the women carrying the men through the water to the boats, but I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who--I mean---" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{surprised}} {{you to hear}} me called by that name. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> name, and I have now taken it in obedience to my brother's wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It may be so,' said Henry; 'and yet--Jerusalem! Jerusalem! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> cry; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> King Edward's cry; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> St. Louis' cry; and {{yet they}} never got there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that I have," [...] replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; [...] "but I cannot think what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> knows all about <b>it,</b> but he <b>is</b> not here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait! Don't go! Oh, hear a last word!... May a {{more just}} and merciful God than the God I {{was taught to}} worship judge me--forgive me--save me! For I can no longer keep silent!... Lassiter, in {{pleading}} for Dyer I've been pleading more for my father. My father was a Mormon master, close to {{the leaders of the}} church. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who sent Dyer out to proselyte. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who had the blue-ice eye and the beard of gold. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> you got trace of in the past years. Truly, Dyer ruined Milly Erne--dragged her from her home--to Utah--to Cottonwoods. But it was for my father! If Milly Erne was ever wife of a Mormon that Mormon was my father! I never knew--never will know whether or not she was a wife. Blind I may be, Lassiter--fanatically faithful to a false religion I may have been but I know justice, and my father is beyond human justice. Surely he is meeting just punishment--somewhere. Always it has appalled me--the thought of your killing Dyer for my father's sins. So I have prayed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Aweel, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> laid it down,’ said she. ‘There {{were few}} {{knew more about}} port wine than my father, God rest him!’ She settled herself in a chair with an {{alarming}} air of resolution. ‘And so there is some particular direction that you wish to go in?’ said she.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{would not}} ask you, Angus, {{and of course}} you are {{differently}} placed; but I have my rights as a peeress of France; besides I have on my own account no complaint against the king. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who shut me up in the convent, not the king." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beef, marrow-bones, and rice," [...] {{replied the}} man. [...] "You may call me Samuel if you like. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> first name, but I'm best known among my friends as Ravoninohitriniony." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> the whipper-in, - [...] Is still--if I'm not misled? And now I see, {{where the}} hedge is thin, [...] A little spot of red; [...] Surely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> [...] Going to the kennel-shed! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cursed {{and fought}} my father--aye, [...] And sailed {{to a foreign}} land; And feeling sorry, I'm back, to stay, [...] Please God, as his helping hand. [...] Surely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> [...] Near where the kennels stand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Awell, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> laid it down," [...] said she. [...] "There {{were few}} {{knew more about}} port wine than my father, God rest him!" [...] She settled herself in a chair with an {{alarming}} air of resolution. [...] "And so there is some particular direction that you wish to go in?" [...] said she.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, {{there is}} no better friend for a lad than a good woman, Gilmore. In that sense my mother was my {{greatest}} friend. Most mothers are against their sons going to sea. In my case <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who objected, but my mother, seeing how I was bent upon it, persuaded him to let me go.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True--true," [...] she said, after a moment's reflection, [...] "my {{brother was}} then at college. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> my poor father, whom {{you had some}} quarrel with.--But you will come to Shaws-Castle on Thursday, at two o'clock?--John {{will be glad to}} see you--he can be kind when he pleases--and then we will talk of old times--I must get on, to have things ready--Good evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do all {{the work}} now. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> shop, but he's dead. It began by being my grandfather's. He started it. But he's so old now that, of course, he can't work any longer, so I look after things.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the {{pleasure}} of Heaven to bestow those talents on me, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> pride to cultivate them to the utmost of his power. I should therefore be guilty of a double dereliction of duty in abandoning their exercise.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> {{that the}} white men come into my story, whom we named the Amaboona, but you call the Boers. Ou! I think ill of those Amaboona, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> I who gave them the victory over Dingaan--I and Umslopogaas.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{who came}} {{home in the}} evening with his mouth full of poor Jim. He had been deadly drunk since midday, had been down to Westhouse Links to fight the gipsy champion, {{and it was not}} certain that the man would live through the night. My father had met Jim on the highroad, dour as a thunder-cloud, and with an insult in his eye for every man that passed him. [...] "Guid sakes!" [...] said the old man. [...] "He'll make a fine {{practice}} for himsel', if breaking banes will do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{noise is}} that? What's {{going on down}} there?" [...] cried a deep bass voice in the distance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> No one replied. Presently my father's bedroom bell rang with extreme violence. Edwards rushed out of the butler's room. The butler fell back, opened his mouth, and pretended to be asleep--snoring moderately. This of itself would have undeceived any one, for when the old hypocrite was really asleep he never snored moderately. The cook and housemaid uttered two little shrieks and slammed their {{respective}} doors, while the bell rang violently a second time.|$|E
6000|$|... "As we {{neared the}} city's {{southern}} extremity a sound {{came to us}} from across the mossy flat, {{from the direction of}} the only pass through the hills which led to the gates, the pass by which caravans from either north or south or east or west would enter the city. The sounds we heard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars, with the occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body of warriors. The thought uppermost in her mind was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> returned from his expedition, but the cunning of the Thark held her from headlong and precipitate flight to greet him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eric, I say to thee now, what I {{have said}} before, that I love thee alone of all men, and, if <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> wish, I will wed no other whilst thou dost remain true {{to me and}} hold me dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you, miss," [...] he said. [...] "As to why I came to live here, I do so simply because the house belongs to me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> and his father's. We folk {{who live in the}} country make few changes." ...|$|R
60|$|You will {{substantiate}} them. What a {{chain of}} theft <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> steals from the people. The documents that prove his stealing are stolen by Gherst. Hubbard steals them from you and returns them to <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> And I steal them from <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and pass them back to you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} on, Mr Headstone, don't you be afraid. I am {{going on to}} the end, and I have told you {{beforehand}} what the end is. Now, you know my story. You are as well aware as I am, that I have had many disadvantages to leave behind me in life. You have heard me mention my father, and you are sufficiently acquainted {{with the fact that}} the home from which I, as I may say, escaped, might have been a more creditable one than <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> died, and then it might have been supposed that my way to respectability was pretty clear. No. For then my sister begins.' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> discoursed, if not {{in those}} {{particular}} words, yet exactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road, with resentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and flinging out clumsy illustrative motions at the outskirts of Bromstead as we passed along them. That afternoon he hated Bromstead, from its foot-tiring pebbles up. He had no illusions about Bromstead or himself. I have the clearest impression of him in his garden-stained tweeds with a deer-stalker hat {{on the back of}} his head and presently a pipe sometimes between his teeth and sometimes in his gesticulating hand, as he became diverted by his talk from his original exasperation....|$|E
6000|$|... "SIR,--My father, Captain Boyns, directs me {{to inform}} you that your [...] daughter, Miss Annie, has been saved from the wreck of your brig, the [...] Water Lily, which ran aground here this afternoon, and has become a [...] total wreck. Your daughter's nurse and the crew have also been [...] rescued by our new lifeboat, which is a noble craft, and, with God's [...] blessing, will yet do good service on this coast. I have {{pleasure}} in [...] adding, from myself, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who rescued your child. [...] She fell into the sea when being passed from the wreck into the boat, [...] and sank, but my father dived and brought her up in safety.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his work, Singer said,"Every piece is made with the various {{meanings}} from my traditional ways - the Navajo way of living. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a silversmith, too. He taught me, and wanted me to continue this trade. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> dream that I learn to silversmith so that I could continue his beliefs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{he likes}} to come and take it he’s welcome!" [...] said Pepper; [...] "it’s <b>my</b> chair, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father’s</b> before me, but there’s no man living I would sooner give it to than your first. Ah! {{he knew what he}} was about when the Dolphin went down, he did. I don’t blame him, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know;--I understand. They {{made her}} {{write a letter}} to you. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> doing. I will tell you the whole truth. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> doing, and {{therefore}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that I think myself bound to speak to you. Her mother came to him for advice, and he had heard evil things spoken of you in Baslehurst. You will see that I am very frank with you. And I will take some credit to myself too. I believed such tidings to be altogether false, and I made inquiry which proved that I <b>was</b> right. But <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had given the advice which he thought best. I do not know what Rachel wrote to you, but a girl's letter under such circumstances can hardly do more than express the will of those who guide her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> sad enough for her to be forced to write such a letter, but <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> sadder still if you cannot be brought to forgive it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{after that}} we were told about Sir Walter, how great he was, how good, how, like Napoleon, his evil destiny found him at last, and he wore his heart away for honour's sake. And we were given the [...] "Lay," [...] and [...] "The Lady of the Lake." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who first read [...] "Tam o' Shanter" [...] to me, for which I confess I did not care at that time, preferring to take witches and bogies with great seriousness. It seemed as if Burns were trifling with a noble subject. But {{it was in a}} summer sunset, beside a window looking out on Ettrick and the hill of the Three Brethren's Cairn, that I first read, with the dearest of all friends, how-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No one knows,” Beatrix went on, without noticing this {{interruption}} {{except by}} a look, “what my mother’s life is. She hath been at early prayer this morning: she passes hours in her closet; {{if you were}} to follow her thither, you would find her at prayers now. She tends the poor of the place—the horrid dirty poor! She sits through the curate’s sermons—oh, those dreary sermons! And you see, on a beau dire; but good as they are, people like her are not fit to commune with us of the world. There is always, as it were, a third person present, even when I and my mother are alone. She can’t be frank with me quite; who is always thinking of the next world, and of her guardian angel, perhaps that’s in company. Oh, Harry, I’m jealous of that guardian angel!” here broke out Mistress Beatrix. “It’s horrid, I know; but my mother’s life is all for Heaven, and mine—all for earth. We can never be friends quite; and then, she cares more for Frank’s little finger than she does for me—I know she does: and she loves you, sir, a great deal too much; and I hate you for it. I would have had her all to myself; but she wouldn’t. In my childhood, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> she loved—(Oh, how could she? I remember him kind and handsome, but so stupid, {{and not being able to}} speak after drinking wine). And then, it was Frank; and now, it is Heaven and the clergyman. How I would have loved her! From a child I used to be in a rage that she loved anybody but me; but she loved you all better—all, I know she did. And now, she talks of the blessed consolation of religion. Dear soul! she thinks she is happier for believing, as she must, that we are all of us wicked and miserable sinners; and this world is only a pied à terre for the good, where they stay for a night, as we do, coming from Walcote, at that great, dreary, uncomfortable Hounslow inn, in those horrid beds. Oh, do you remember those horrid beds?—and the chariot comes and fetches them to Heaven the next morning.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{should mention}} that during these two months--which seemed a long life {{to me from the}} novelty and {{intensity}} of the pleasures and pains I underwent--my diseased anticipation in other people's consciousness continued to torment me; now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and now my brother, now Mrs. Filmore or her husband, and now our German courier, whose stream of thought rushed upon me like a ringing in the ears not to be got rid of, though it allowed my own impulses and ideas to continue their uninterrupted course. It was like a preternaturally heightened sense of hearing, making audible to one a roar of sound where others find perfect stillness. The weariness and disgust of this involuntary intrusion into other souls was counteracted only by my ignorance of Bertha, and my growing passion for her; a passion enormously stimulated, if not produced, by that ignorance. She was my oasis of mystery in the dreary desert of knowledge. I had never allowed my diseased condition to betray itself, or to drive me into any unusual speech or action, except once, when, in a moment of peculiar bitterness against my brother, I had forestalled some words which I {{knew he was going to}} utter--a clever observation, which he had prepared beforehand. He had occasionally a slightly affected hesitation in his speech, and when he paused an instant after the second word, my impatience and jealousy impelled me to continue the speech for him, as if it were something we had both learned by rote. He coloured and looked astonished, as well as annoyed; and the words had no sooner escaped my lips than I felt a shock of alarm lest such an anticipation of words--very far from being words of course, easy to divine--should have betrayed me as an exceptional being, a sort of quiet energumen, whom every one, Bertha above all, would shudder at and avoid. But I magnified, as usual, the impression any word or deed of mine could produce on others; for no one gave any sign of having noticed my interruption as more than a rudeness, to be forgiven me on the score of my feeble nervous condition.|$|E
5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.|$|R
60|$|Trevorsham had enough, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{would have}} given us if he could.|$|R
6000|$|... "What if <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> brig?" [...] whispered Fred Ellice, as {{he grasped}} Singleton's arm, {{and turned to}} him a face of ashy paleness.|$|R
