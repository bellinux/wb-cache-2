40|$|The {{concept of}} Net Present Value (NPV) {{is a widely}} {{accepted}} tool for verification of financial rationality of planned investment projects. Projects with positive NPV increase a company's value. Similarly, those with negative NPV lead {{to a decline in}} the value of a business. This article attempts to answer the question: are projects with negative NPV always disadvantageous in terms of maximization of shareholder value and when should an NPV-negative project be considered justified? The authors discuss the issues of project valuation depending on different conditions. First, they briefly summarize the main idea of valuation - the aim of every company is to maximize shareholder value. Contemporary professional texts say that the way to achieve this goal is through projects that can generate a positive Net Present Value. When there are no such investments within reach, the company should pay dividends to its owners. The authors claim that some circumstances justify investments with a negative Net Present Value, as they still produce maximum possible shareholder value. The three model situations where this takes place are: (1) tax on dividends; (2) shareholders' perception of risk; and (3) temporary inefficiency of the markets. Taxes on dividends reduce cashflows for shareholders from distributed dividends. Therefore, they act exactly as an investment with a negative NPV. The authors conclude that this creates an opportunity to maximize shareholder value by comparing this loss with available alternate projects with negative NPV. If the loss of worth, caused by such taxes, is bigger that the negative NPV of possible investments it will be more rational to invest instead of paying dividends. And, according to the authors, a project with a negative NPV leads to maximized shareholder value. In the second situation, the authors point out that some projects may have negative fundamental (intrinsic) value when valuated by the market (diversified owners) because of their higher expected rate of return. In the same circumstances, an undiversified shareholder may have a different perception of the investment. It is highly possible that he would be ready to accept a lower rate of return in exchange for more safety for his capital. The authors conclude that negative fundamental value (based on the market situation) may be of importance for such shareholder as he prefers projects with lower risk and a lower rate of return. Temporary inefficiencies of the markets may produce a risk of bankruptcy or liquidity problems. The authors argue that NPV-negative projects may be a way to <b>free</b> additional <b>cashflows,</b> which will allow the financial restructuring of the company. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} dividend {{changes in}} an emerging market: Thailand. We begin {{by considering the}} possible effects of the Thai corporate environment on dividend policy. We develop a theoretical model that considers {{the relationship between the}} strength of investor power and dividends in an agency cost/free cashflow framework. This allows us to consider the conditions for the outcome (positive relationship) or substitute (negative relationship) models, as discussed by La Porta et al. (2000). Our model also allows us to consider the expropriation hypothesis, in which the presence of large controlling shareholders may actually reduce outside investor power, leading to lower dividends. We then turn to our empirical analysis. Employing a large sample of companies that changed dividends in Thailand during the period 1996 – 2009, we test for the signaling, <b>free</b> <b>cashflow</b> and life-cycle hypotheses. A further contribution of our analysis is that we consider the impact of investor power and ownership on dividends in Thailand. Overall, we find little support for the signaling hypothesis, but we find considerable support for the <b>free</b> <b>cashflow</b> and life-cycle hypotheses. Our analysis of ownership variables suggests that increasing investor power (for example, high ownership concentration together with the presence of domestic institutional ownership) results in higher dividends, in support of the outcome model, rather than the substitution or expropriation models...|$|E

We find that such firms hold less cash than similar companies operating in countries where both shareholders and creditors’ rights are more tightly protected by the law. In addition, our regression results suggest that leverage, other liquid assets, and firm growth are negatively correlated with our sample firms’ cash holdings whereas long-term debt and financial distress are positively correlated.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of loss aversion on escalating commitment and dividend payout policies Stephany van der Werf An experiment is conducted {{to answer the}} following research question: How does loss aversion influence escalating commitment (entrapment) in regards to the <b>free</b> <b>cashflow</b> model and dividend payout policies? Escalating commitment causes managers to invest in projects that are less than optimal, which is against the expectation of the rational utility maximization model. However, an irrational manager may be unaware of behavioral bias. People must understand their own irrational mistakes and avoid these mistakes in order to avoid investing in projects that are less than optimal (Shefrin, 2000). Different psychological causes for escalating commitment include: managerial optimism, managerial overconfidence, self-justification and loss aversion. The focus in this research is on loss aversion, which forms part of the prospect theory. The goal of this research is to provide a scientific contribution to the existing prospect theory in regards to dividends and EOC. In the experiment 65 % of the participants were found to behave relatively irrational and 35 % were classified as relatively rational. Interestingly, not one participant behaved 100 % rationally. There is a significant difference between rational and irrational participants in regards to their loss aversion and escalating commitment level. Indicating a higher level of loss aversion and escalating commitment for the irrational group. HO is rejected in regards to loss aversion. HO for loss aversion is stated as follows: subpopulation 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 are not influenced by loss aversion when making escalating investment decisions. This research indicates that there is a difference as to how the subpopulations handle loss aversion. Yet, {{there was no significant difference}} as to how they handle dividend decisions. Thus, for dividends the hypothesis was accepted, namely: there is no difference between subpopulation 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 as to how dividend payouts are assessed. Even though EOC occurred more often for the irrational group than the rational group the explanations given by the two different groups as to why EOC behavior occurred did not vary significantly. In other words, HO, which stated: “there is no difference between subpopulation 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 in regards to their explanation for EOC behavior in regards to investment behavior” is accepted. Thus, in regards to the problem statement theoretical proof has been found as loss aversion is dependent upon how a situation is framed and this is influenced by negative feedback. Negative feedback will weigh twice as powerful than positive feedback of the same volume and negative feedback increases loss aversion. The desire to recover sunk costs increases EOC and risk seeking behavior. Loss aversion related to irrational managers can lead to lower discount rates (lower IRR) to value cashflows, which will lead to a higher net present value, which leads to higher investments & higher debt & consequently lower dividend payouts as opposed to rational managers. The <b>free</b> <b>cashflow</b> model states that lower dividends will lead to higher cashflow, thus higher investments hopefully leading to increased capital gain to offset dividend payment. Yet, managers are reluctant to cut dividends even in financial distress to increase cashflow, because dividends are sticky and managers do not want to make dividend changes that need to be readjusted in the future. However, empirical proof in regards to the problem statement has only partially been found. No empirical proof has been found that loss aversion is the cause of EOC behavior. This can be due to the amount of items used to analyze EOC. By increasing the items relating to loss aversion a closer analysis as to how these are related to EOC can be done. However, a positive correlation has been found between EOC and dividend payout, which is against the expectancy of the <b>free</b> <b>cashflow</b> model, which predicts a negative relationship between EOC and dividend payouts. Managers are now finding themselves spending additional money on a failing research project and they spend an increasing amount of cashflow on dividends as well. However, the increased level of dividends could potentially offset the negative effects of failed investment projects in regards to keeping shareholders satisfied short-term...|$|E
