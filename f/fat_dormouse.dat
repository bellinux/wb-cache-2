40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} {{reproductive}} strategy {{of a population}} of <b>fat</b> <b>dormice</b> (Myoxus glis) breeding in nest boxes in a beech forest on the southern Alps, Italy. In eight years of data collection (1991 - 1998), we observed births only in 1991, 1992, and 1995. We did not observe young during the autumn dispersal in the remaining five years. Reproduction was not correlated with high rainfall, low temperature in summer, or with population density. Reproduction was only observed in years of beech mast seeding. Body condition of adults when they emerged from hibernation did not differ between years with and without reproduction, suggesting that the adults may avoid breeding when the young have a low probability of surviving their first winter. A capture-recapture analysis on individually marked adult <b>fat</b> <b>dormice</b> identified a very high yearly survival rate (0. 86 - 0. 92), close to that of large herbivorous mammals and much higher than that typical of other rodent species with similar body size. No influence of sex on survival or recapture probability was detected. The long life span expectancy of an adult dormouse (averaging nine years) is the prerequisite for the infrequent breeding strategy adopted by this rodent species to cope with an unpredictable food source. A high survival rate despite the small body size may have been possible because of the long hibernation time (> 6 months). Long life span and intermittent breeding make the life history of <b>fat</b> <b>dormice</b> unique among rodents...|$|R

In years with high population densities fat dormice start cause damage on trees. Mainly they damage {{the bark of}} common spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). This work presents the analysis of morphological parameters of 248 caught individuals (119 males and 129 females) of <b>fat</b> <b>dormouse.</b> Animals were caught on three locations from year 2001 to 2009 in forests managed by »Hrvatske šume« d. o. o. Zagreb, forest administration Delnice. First location represents forest culture of common spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (location »a«) under management of forest office Delnice. Second and third locations under management of forest office Mrkopalj represent forest culture of common spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (location »b«) and natural forest of common beech (association Fagetum montanum croaticum Ht.) (location »c«). Animals were caught with snap traps set individually or in pairs in trees around 1 to 5 meters above ground. Ripe pods of the carob tree were used as bait. Traps were set late afternoon and checked next day {{early in the morning}} or during the day. Body length as morphological parameter was measured with steel tape and body mass with one gram accuracy scale. In total on all three locations 127 individuals were caught in year 2001, 53 individuals in year 2007 and 68 individuals in year 2009. For the whole time period 102 / 248 animals were caught on location »a«, 64 / 248 on location »b« and 82 / 248 on location »c«. On all 3 locations in year 2001 the highest number of animals was recorded reflecting favorable trophical conditions. Analysis of animals showed for all three locations 1 : 1 sex ratio with small difference on location »c« with sex ratio of 1 : 1. 16 (m:f).

40|$|The {{structure}} of teeth in all living beings is genetically predetermined, {{although it can}} change under external physiological and pathological factors. The author’s hypothesis was to indicate evolutional shifts resulting from genetic, functional and other differences. A comparative study about certain characteristics of incisors in humans and myomorpha, the <b>fat</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Glis glis) being their representative as well, comprised measurements of enamel and dentin thickness in individual incisor segments, evaluation of external enamel index, and also assessment of histological {{structure of}} enamel and dentin. The study results involving dormice showed the enamel to be thicker in lower than in the upper teeth, quite contrary to enamel thickness in humans. In the upper incisors in dormice the enamel is the thickest in the medial layer of the crown, and in the cervical portion of the crown in the lower incisors. The thickness of dentin in dormice is greater in the oral than in the vestibular side.

Animals were captured in wooden live-traps twice a month, during trapping periods lasting three days each, and marked individually by tattooing. Demographic results show that, in three subpopulations, population structure differed extremely between 1992 and 1993. In 1992, more adult than subadult dormice occurred {{in the study area}} and the reverse was found in 1993. Subadults emerged from hibernation a little before or together with adult dormice. Adult males emerged signi®cantly earlier than adult females. After a year with good reproductive success (1992), a total lack of reproduction was observed in 1993. Juvenile dormice were neither found in traps nor in nest-boxes. The assessment of gonadal states indicated that all males (adult and subadult) remained in a state of testicular regression throughout the year 1993. Also, no female was found lactating. Reproductive failure coincided with a lack of food resources in the autumn of 1993 (e. g. fruits of oaks and beeches). Body mass changes imply high energy expenditure prior to mating in adult males. It seems likely that males in years with low food availability do not invest energy in reproduction. Key words: Glis glis/Myoxus glis, body weight, population ecology, breeding, mating effor...|$|E
40|$|In Slovenia the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) {{is on its}} {{south-western}} {{limit of}} distribution and belongs to the southern subspecies Strix uralensis macroura. Dark coloured owls are characteristic for this subspecies and represent between 5 to 15 % of the population. Slovenian breeding population size is estimated at 400 to 700 pairs. The densities of territories ranges between 0. 9 to 13. 4 territories per 10 km 2, and the highest are reached in mountain forests of southern Dinaric region. In the forests with dominant deciduous trees, e. g. Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Pedinculate Oak (Quercus robur), the breeding densities are significantly {{higher than in the}} forests with higher proportion of coniferous trees, e. g. Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The species does not select specific altitude and throughout Slovenia it occurs between 150 and 1600 m a. s. l.   The most of the nest found at natural nest-sites were in tree holes or semi-holes (56 %) and at the tree stumps (20 %). Nest boxes were occupied less frequently in Slovenia with occupancy rate of 29 %. At least in mountain regions breeding begins quite late, between 15 March to 21 June. Average clutch size is 3. 3 ± 1. 0 eggs per nest. About 80 % of all nests are successful raising at least one young. The diet shifts significantly between breeding and non-breeding period due to the seasonality in prey availability. According to the biomass the most important prey in breeding period are mice (Muridae), voles (Arvicollidae) and mole (Talpa europaea), but in the non-breeding period voles and dormice (Gliridae) predominate. Large <b>Fat</b> <b>Dormouse</b> (Glis glis) seems to have very important role in the post-breeding period, but not in the breeding period due to its dormancy. As a large forest-dwelling predator the Ural Owl shapes the raptor community in the forest by excluding mezopredator species, as Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), what allows smaller raptors, e. g. Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) to expend their ranges to lower elevations. However, this pattern is not general through the whole Ural Owl range since species ecology and morphology could be regionally quite different, therefore ecological studies from different parts of Ural Owl range are needed...|$|E
40|$|The Grotta Grande of Scario is {{a coastal}} cave {{located in the}} centre of Mediterranean region on the Tyrrhenian side of the Italian Peninsula. The {{morphology}} of the cave and the sedimentary processes were controlled by the eustatic fluctuations during the late Middle Pleistocene and the early Late Pleistocene. The cave was frequented by humans of Middle Palaeolithic culture. The site is located 2 Km {{from the village of}} Scario (Salerno, Campania, Southern Italy). The cave, which develops along a fault perpendicular to the coast line, is formed by two large chambers joined by a short corridor. The external chamber opens directly on the sea. Excavations have been carried on since 1979 by the University of Siena in collaboration with Soprintendenza Archeologica of Salerno. Six test pits have been excavated, the most significant of which are located close to the entrance of the cave (trenches A, F), while a third pit, whose study is in progress, is located along the corridor (trench C). Stratigraphy. Two different series have been recognised in trench A. The older one (about 2, 4 m thick) is represented by a marine conglomerate at the bottom, followed by continental sandy - silty deposits sealed by a stalagmite. An erosional surface cuts these deposits, followed by a red cemented breccia with alternating concreted archaeological and earth levels that represent the younger series (about 1 m thick). The occurrence of Cladocora coespitosa and Spondylus sp. within the basal conglomerate and a 135 ± 11 Ka dating (230 Th/ 234 U method) of the stalagmite suggests that the lower series of trench A may have formed during the interglacial-glacial cycle correlated to the OIS 7 – OIS 6. The retrieval of Strombus bubonius within the basal level of the younger sequence indicates that the deposition of this series possibly started during a high-stand phase nearly contemporaneous or slightly after the Eutyrrhenian (OIS 5 e). The series of trench F (about 1 m thick) is more articulated and a very synthetic report is given here. The bottom is made up by a breccia level with S. bubonius and Patella ferruginea followed by a marine conglomerate on which a continental series is superposed. The continental deposits are mainly archaeological, and are sealed at the top by a tephra level. The discovery of a paleo-surface inhabited by humans within the continental levels is noteworthy. The occurrence of the warm molluscs assemblage in the basal level suggests that the deposition of this series also started after the Euthyrrhenian high-stand. Archaeology. Trench F is particularly interesting for the presence of structures which organize the living space, both horizontally as well as vertically, in between them. These structures, rather rare in Middle Palaeolithic, testify to a settlement organization, with clean areas separated from spaces with waste products accumulation. A small stretch of wall made up of large stalagmite intentionally resting on a pile of stones, bones and ground separates in this area the cave atrium from a shallow tunnel, a sort of a little cave into the cave. Inside the tunnel there is an accumulation of stones, pebbles and pieces of concretion, lithic tools and bones along the two lateral walls; the central band is almost totally free of materials and completely free of charcoal. The lithic industry is characterized by the prevalence of calcareous knapped pebbles over the debitage products, only half of which being in flintmaterials. Just in the outside zone, in the both areas A and F, retouched implements (mostly lateral convex scrapers and transversal straight scrapers) appear together with flakes and more numerous cores. The Levallois system is present. The raw material used by prehistoric men was mainly flint pebbles but also jasper or quartzite are utilised; a small part of lithic industry is made out of bad quality flint lists, stratified in the limestone of the territory near the cave. Vertebrates. Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians remains have been found, but only mammals have been studied in the details. Trenches A and F yielded a fairly diversified large mammal assemblage. The ruminants are common in both trenches and include ibex, fallow deer, red deer and bison, while roe deer and chamois are present in trench A only. The occurrence of wild boar is sporadic. Scant remains document the occurrence of the straight tusked elephant and of a hippo in trench F, while a single specimen documents the forest rhino in trench A. Carnivores are rare: only the brown bear is represented by skeletal remains, while the probable occurrence of a hyena is documented by one coprolite found on the human occupational surface in trench F. Large mammal remains are concentrated within the archaeological levels. Small mammals are represented by more numerous remains and document a well diversified assemblage. The long tailed field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) is the dominant taxon. The water vole and the Savi ground vole are present in both trenches, while the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is present only in trench F. In trench A some pine voles (Terricola subterraneus) have been identified. The <b>fat</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Glis glis) occurs in both trenches but it is more represented in the lower levels of trench F associated with the common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), while the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) is present only in trench A. Among insectivores three species of mole, the lesser white toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) and the bicoloured shrew (Crocidura leucodon) have been recognised in trench F, while only C. suaveolens and Talpa europaea have been so far identified in trench A. The hedgehog is a sporadic occurrence in trench F only. Eventually some bats also occur, which have still to be studied in the details. The changes in the relative abundance of small mammal taxa indicates a forested environment in {{the lower part of the}} continental deposits of trench F, as it is documented by the abundance of dormice and the occurrence of the bank vole. The landscape evolves towards more open conditions (perhaps related to more arid climate) in the upper portion of the F sequence. The occurrence of the hippo and the abundance of fallow deer remains confirms the temperate–warm climate in the lower deposits. The lower series of trench A lacks vertebrate remains, while vertebrates occur in the upper part of the younger sequence. The large mammal assemblage is here dominated by the ibex followed by the fallow deer and the roe deer. The sporadic occurrence of the chamois is noteworthy. Among small mammals the Savi ground vole is abundant, while the dormice are poorly represented. This assemblage seems to indicate a landscape that was locally less forested and cooler climatic conditions, that are likely posterior to the warmer forested environment in which the F trench series was deposited. Palinology. Pollen was studied in both sequences of trench A (published data) and the analysis of trench F is in progress. In the lower A sequence pollen showed a forest landscape (Abies, Juniperus type, Pinus, deciduous broadleaves, Quercus ilex and other Mediterranean trees) and some shifts of vegetational belts possibly forced by minor climatic oscillations. In the upper A sequence pollen suggest that more significant climatic-depending vegetation changes had occurred and forest clearance was in progress. At the top the climate shifted towards cooler conditions and a dry steppe-like vegetation spread in the landscape. Conclusions. The Grotta Grande record can be positioned within the climatic fluctuation posterior to the warm interglacial OIS 5 e peak. Deposit of this interval are rather uncommon even in the Italian peninsula and therefore the integration of sedimentological, archaeological, faunal and palinological data provides an important piece of information to the puzzling reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene Mediterranean environments before the onset of the glaciation...|$|E
