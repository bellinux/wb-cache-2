500|$|Steve West of Cinemablend {{stated that}} [...] "the balance between {{laughing}} at Michael’s ineptitude and the discomfit of Oscar was handled so deftly that it’s a wonder the show became successful when similarly <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> in Arrested Development {{did nothing to}} garner viewers." [...] For his work on this episode, Greg Daniels won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

500|$|Alpha Centauri's {{science fiction}} storyline {{received}} high praise; IGN considered the game {{an exception to}} PC sci-fi cliches, and GamePro compared the plot to the works of writers Stanley Kubrick and Isaac Asimov. J.C. Herz of The New York Times suggested that the game was a marriage of SimCity and Frank Herbert's Dune. GamePros Dan Morris said [...] "As the single-player campaign builds to its final showdown, the ramifications of the final theoretical discoveries elevate Alpha Centauri from great strategy game to science-fiction epic." [...] Game Revolution said, [...] "The well crafted story, admirable science-fiction world, fully realized scenario, and quality core gameplay are sure to please." [...] Edge praised the uniqueness of expression saying it was [...] "the same kind of old-fashioned, consensual storytelling that once drew universes out of ASCII." [...] The in-game writing and faction leaders were also well-received for their believability, especially the voice acting. GameSpot reviewer Denny Atkin called the factions and their abilities Alpha Centauris [...] "most impressive aspect". Greg Tito of The Escapist said, [...] "the genius {{of the game is}} how it flawlessly blends its <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> with strategy elements." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} show and said the {{decision}} to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, [...] "Let's hope the changes work, because Homicide is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." [...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E

[...] In the end, the <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> outweighed the slightly bothersome contrivances to make this yet another laugh-filled episode of 30 Rock." [...] He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy [...] "gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities". Canning reported that the Liz plot had [...] "its funny moments", but opined that it was hard to [...] "get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew", in regards to her being a [...] "domineering boss that cares little about her employees." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together [...] "was a genius move." [...] She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was [...] "another great week" [...] in her [...] "continuing portrayal of what being a hard-working gal is actually like." [...] Ward enjoyed Tracy's speech, noting that it was [...] "priceless", and was glad to see him having [...] "ample screen time... which was a nice change of pace." [...] TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote he enjoyed all of the episode's storyline pairings, but much enjoyed Jack and Tracy. Further in his recap, Mitovich reported that Liz's plot could have been better had the comedy show How I Met Your Mother [...] "not gone there with the C-word" [...] in an episode. Though, he said that Liz's story [...] "had a fitting message – that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer. Plus, her story gave us that winning flurry of flashbacks to times when she was a... not very nice lady." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Frații Jderi, Sadoveanu's fresco of Moldavian history {{maintains}} its setting, but moves {{back in time}} to the 15th century rule of Prince Stephen the <b>Great.</b> <b>Writing</b> in 1941, before its final part was in print, Călinescu argued that the novel was part of Sadoveanu's [...] "most valuable work", and noted [...] "the maturity of its verbal means." [...] In the first volume, titled Ucenicia lui Ionuț ("Ionuț's Apprenticeship"), the eponymous Jderi brothers, allies of Stephen and friends of his son Alexandru, fight off the enemies of their lord on several occasions. In what is the start of a Bildungsroman, the youngest Jder, Ionuț Păr-Negru, consumed by love for Lady Nasta, who was kidnapped by Tatars. He goes to her rescue, only to find out that she had preferred suicide to a life of slavery. Călinescu, who believed the volumes show Sadoveanu's move to the consecrated elements of adventure novels, called them [...] "remarkable", but stressed that the narrative could render [...] "the feeling of stumbling, of a languishing flow", and that the dénouement was [...] "rather depressing". The second book in the series (Izvorul alb, [...] "The White Water Spring") intertwines the life of the Jderi brothers with that of Stephen's family: the ruler weds the Byzantine princess Mary of Mangop, while Simion Jder falls for Marușca, who is supposedly Stephen's illegitimate daughter. The major episodes in the narrative are Marușca's kidnapping by a boyar, her captivity in Jagiellon Poland, and her rescue {{at the hands of the}} Jderi. The 1942 conclusion of the cycle, Oamenii Măriei-sale ("His Lordship's Men"), the brothers are shown defending their ancestral rights and their lord against the Ottoman invader and ambivalent boyars, and crushing the former at the Battle of Vaslui.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Soergel of The Florida Times-Union states: [...] "Its propulsive {{and complex}} {{storytelling}} is matched by, at best, {{just a handful}} of theatrical movies a year." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle opines, [...] "Battlestar Galactica transcends the sci-fi genre; it competes, creatively, on the same level as any other top-tier drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald states: [...] "A drama this gripping comes ’round rarely." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best TV shows of all time. Time magazine also wrote in the spring of 2005 that the new show was one of the six best drama programs on television. It would proclaim the program the best show on television in December of the same year. [...] Television Without Pity describes Battlestar Galactica as [...] "one of the finest, most beautifully written, expertly acted shows on television." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger writes: [...] "hat makes Galactica so gripping is its emphasis on character over hardware. The explosions and the killer robots are cool, but they don't stack up to seeing drawn people - brought to life by a <b>great</b> <b>writing</b> staff led by producer Ron Moore and an astonishing cast led by Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell - grapple with these life-or-death, genocide-level decisions." [...] Joshua Alston of Newsweek declares that the show [...] "captures better than any other TV drama of the past eight years the fear, uncertainty and moral ambiguity of the post-9/11 world" [...] and [...] "always finds ways to challenge the audience's beliefs." [...] It has also been named the best science fiction series by IGN.com and Boston.com. The series placed #59 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list. Empire ranked it #6 on its list of the 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and ranked it #57 in its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it 38th on their list of the 101 Best-Written TV Series of All Time.|$|E

60|$|The {{announcement}} {{that one of}} the most ingenious and accomplished men of letters in Europe was engaged upon a history of the French Revolution, raised some doubts among those who have thought most about the qualifications proper to the historian. M. Taine has the quality of the best type of a man of letters; he has the fine critical aptitude for seizing the secret of an author's or an artist's manner, for penetrating to dominant and central ideas, for marking the abstract and general under accidental forms in which they are concealed, for connecting the achievements of literature and art with facts of society and impulses of human character and life. He is the master of a style which, if it seems to lack the breadth, the firmness, the sustained and level strength of <b>great</b> <b>writing,</b> is yet always energetic, and fresh, and alive with that spontaneous reality and independence of interest which distinguishes the genuine writer from the mere weaver of sentences and the servile mechanic of the pen. The matter and form alike of M. Taine's best work--and we say best, for his work is by no means without degrees and inequalities of worth--prove that he has not shrunk from the toil and austerity of the student, from that scorn of delight and living of laborious days, by which only can men either get command of the art of just and finished expression, or gather to themselves much knowledge.|$|E
