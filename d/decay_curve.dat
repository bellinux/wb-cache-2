5000|$|Besides {{experimental}} difficulties, {{including the}} wavelength dependent instrument response function, mathematical {{treatment of the}} iterative de-convolution problem is not straight forward {{and it is a}} slow process which {{in the early days of}} FLIM made it impractical for a pixel-by-pixel analysis. Non fitting methods are attractive because they offer a very fast solution to lifetime estimation. One of the major and straightforward techniques in this category is the rapid lifetime determination (RLD) method. RLD calculates the lifetimes and their amplitudes directly by dividing the <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> into two parts of equal width [...] t. The analysis is performed by integrating the <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> in equal time intervals t: ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{interesting}} features of the convolution theorem is that the integral of the convolution {{is the product of}} the factors that make up the integral. There are a few techniques which work in transformed space that exploit this property to recover the pure <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> from the measured curve. Laplace and Fourier transformation along with Laguerre gauss expansion have been used to estimate the lifetime in transformed space. These approaches are faster than the deconvolution based methods but they suffer from truncation and sampling problems. Moreover, application of methods like Laguerre gauss expansion is mathematically complicated. In Fourier methods the lifetime of a single exponential <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> is given by: ...|$|E

5000|$|Fluorescent {{moieties}} emit photons several nanoseconds after absorption {{following an}} exponential <b>decay</b> <b>curve,</b> which differs between dyes and {{depends on the}} surrounding solvent. When the dye {{is attached to a}} macromolecules the <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> becomes multiexponential. Conjugated dyes generally have a lifetime between 1-10 ns, a small amount of longer lived exceptions exist, notably pyrene with a lifetime of 400ns in degassed solvents or 100ns in lipids and coronene with 200ns. On a different category of fluorphores are the fluorescent organometals (lanthanides and transition metal-ligand complexes) which have been previously described, which have much longer lifetimes due to the restricted states: lanthanides have lifetimes of 0.5 to 3 ms, while transition metal-ligand complexes have lifetimes of 10 ns to 10 µs. Note that fluorescent lifetime {{should not be confused with}} the photodestruction lifetime or the [...] "shelf-life" [...] of a dye.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL), blue stimulated luminescence (BSL) {{and infrared}} stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals of fluorapatite (originating from Durango, Mexico) were measured {{and found to}} exhibit strong anomalous fading (AF). The experimentally obtained OSL and IRSL <b>decay</b> <b>curves</b> were transformed into pseudo-linear modulated (pseudo-LM) <b>decay</b> <b>curves.</b> The resulting glow-curve shaped pseudo-LM <b>decay</b> <b>curves</b> were analyzed using a deconvolution analysis, {{similar to the one}} used for the glow-curve deconvolution (GCD) of TL glow-curves.

The AF of the remnant TL, BSL and IRSL {{as a function of the}} storage time was fitted using the tunneling model equations and the fading rate g, in terms of percentage per decade was evaluated. According to the obtained g values, the AF of the BSL and IRSL is stronger than that of the TL. The AF of the fast component of BSL and IRSL is almost the same. The AF of the slow component of IRSL is, by approximately a factor of 2, stronger than that of the BSL...|$|R

50|$|This another {{interesting}} feature, {{there is a}} one-to-one correlation between the pixels in the image and their phasors on the phasor plot depending on their spectrum or <b>decay</b> <b>curve.</b> The phasors for pixels with similar temporal-spectral properties fall on a similar regions and this provide a mean for sorting the image pixels according to their temporal-spectral properties. By making region of interest on phasor plot a reciprocal transformation can be performed and the phasors can be projected back to the image which allows a basic segmentation.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a complex}} {{function}} and drawing the Imaginary versus real part of this function for all possible lifetimes will be a semicircle where the zero lifetime is located at (1,0) and the infinite lifetime located at (0,0). By changing the lifetime from zero to infinity the phasor point moves along a semicircle from (1,0) to (0,0). This suggest that by taking the Fourier transformation of a measured <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> and mapping the result on the phasor plot the lifetime can be estimated from {{the position of the}} phasor on the semicircle.|$|E
50|$|In a non-ideal {{and real}} situations, the {{measured}} <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> is the convolution {{of the instrument}} response (the laser pulse distorted by system) with an exponential function which makes the analysis more complicated. Large number of techniques {{have been developed to}} overcome to this problem but in phasor approach this is simply solved {{by the fact that the}} Fourier transformation of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms.

50|$|In Fluorescence {{lifetime}} and spectral imaging, phasor {{can be used}} to visualize the spectra and decay curves. In this method the Fourier transformation of the spectrum or <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> is calculated and the resulted complex number is plotted on a 2D plot where the X axis represents the Real component and the Y axis represents the Imaginary component. This facilitate the analysis since each spectrum and decay is transformed into a unique position on the phasor plot which depends on its spectral width or emission maximum or to its average lifetime. The most important feature of this analysis is that it is fast and it provides a graphical representation of the measured curve.|$|E
50|$|Time-correlated single photon {{counting}} (TCSPC) is used {{to analyze}} the relaxation of molecules from an excited state to a lower energy state. Since various molecules in a sample will emit photons at different times following their simultaneous excitation, the decay must be thought of as having a certain rate rather than occurring at a specific time after excitation. By observing how long individual molecules take to emit their photons, and then combining all these data points, an intensity vs. time graph can be generated that displays the exponential <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> typical to these processes. However, it is difficult to simultaneously monitor multiple molecules. Instead, individual excitation-relaxation events are recorded and then averaged to generate the curve.|$|E
5000|$|The {{semicircle}} represents {{all possible}} single exponential fluorescent decays. When the measured <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> {{consists of a}} superposition of different mono-exponential decays, the phasor falls inside the semicircle depending on the fractional contributions of the components. For a bi-exponential case with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, all phasor values fall on a line connecting the phasors of τ1 and τ2 on the semicircle, and {{the distance from the}} phasor to τ1 determines the fraction α. Therefore, the phasor values of the pixels of an image with two lifetime components are distributed on a line connecting the phasors of τ1 and τ2. Fitting a line through these phasor points with slope (v) and interception (u) , will give two intersections with the semicircle that determine the lifetimes τ1 and τ2: ...|$|E

The absorption spectra were measured using a UV- 1750 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The fluorescence emission spectra and fluorescence lifetime <b>decay</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained by FluoroMax- 4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Palaiseau, France); fluorescence lifetime <b>decay</b> <b>curves</b> were measured with a pulsed 591 -nm nano LED as the excitation source.

5000|$|The {{goal of the}} {{analysis}} algorithm is to extract the pure <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> from the measured decay and to estimate the lifetime(s). The latter is usually accomplished by fitting single or multi exponential functions. A variety of methods {{have been developed to}} solve this problem. The most widely used technique is the least square iterative re-convolution which is based on the minimization of the weighted sum of the residuals. In this technique theoretical exponential decay curves are convoluted with the instrument response function, which is measured separately, and the best fit is found by iterative calculation of the residuals for different inputs until a minimum is found. For a set of observations [...] of the fluorescence signal in time bin i, the lifetime estimation is carried out by minimization of: ...|$|E
50|$|This {{electrical}} pulse comes {{after the second}} laser pulse excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and a photon is eventually emitted from a single molecule upon returning to its original state. Thus, the longer a molecule takes to emit a photon, the higher the voltage of the resulting pulse. The central concept of this technique is that only a single photon is needed to discharge the capacitor. Thus, this experiment must be repeated many times to gather {{the full range of}} delays between excitation and emission of a photon. After each trial, a pre-calibrated computer converts the voltage sent out by the TAC into a time and records the event in a histogram of time since excitation. Since the probability that no molecule will have relaxed decreases with time, a <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> emerges that can then be analyzed to find out the decay rate of the event.|$|E
50|$|Most nuclear {{reactors}} are hence operated in a prompt subcritical, delayed critical condition: the prompt neutrons alone {{are not sufficient}} to sustain a chain reaction, but the delayed neutrons make up the small difference required to keep the reaction going. This has effects on how reactors are controlled: when {{a small amount of}} control rod is slid into or out of the reactor core, the power level changes at first very rapidly due to prompt subcritical multiplication and then more gradually, following the exponential growth or <b>decay</b> <b>curve</b> of the delayed critical reaction. Furthermore, increases in reactor power can be performed at any desired rate simply by pulling out a sufficient length of control rod. However, without addition of a neutron poison or active neutron-absorber, decreases in fission rate are limited in speed, because even if the reactor is taken deeply subcritical to stop prompt fission neutron production, delayed neutrons are produced after ordinary beta decay of fission products already in place, and this decay-production of neutrons cannot be changed.|$|E
40|$|The decay {{process in}} rooms with non-diffuse sound fields {{was the subject}} of this investigation. A {{rectangular}} room with high absorption at the ceiling and low absorption at the walls and floor constituted the basic configuration for the study. Several alterations of the room were carried out, including changes of room dimensions and the type of ceiling absorber, also additional treatment with absorbent material. The effects of these alterations on the <b>decay</b> <b>curves</b> were analysed. In order to predict the gross features of the <b>decay</b> <b>curves,</b> a two-system Statistical Energy Analysis model was developed. The sound field was subdivided into a grazing and nongrazing part. The grazing part comprised modes with propagation direction almost parallel to the 'principal' surface (generally the absorbent ceiling). The nongrazing part comprised the oblique modes, of importance for the decay process. The angle dependent absorbent properties of the principal surface were taken into account when subdividing the sound field into a grazing and nongrazing part.
