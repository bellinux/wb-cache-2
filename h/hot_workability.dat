40|$|The flow {{behaviour}} and processing map of a duplex stainless steel were studied via hot compressive tests in a temperature range of 1223 - 1473 K and a strain rate range of 0. 01 - 30 s- 1. The effect of strain rate and temperature on the <b>hot</b> <b>workability,</b> strain partitioning and dominant {{flow behaviour}} of the alloy was systematically investigated. It is {{found that the}} softening mechanism of each constituent phase differs from each other. The ferrite is softened by dynamic recovery and continuous dynamic recrystallisation (CDRX), while the austenite is softened only by the limited discontinuous dynamic recrystallisation (DDRX). At lower strain rates (0. 01 and 0. 1 s- 1), the strain is mainly accommodated by ferrite due to its excellent softening capability, which causes the apparent activation energy Qp to decline continuously {{with the increase in}} true strain. In this case, plastic deformation of the austenite rarely occurs, and at this time, DDRX of austenite is not observed. When the strain rate increases, CDRX of ferrite is weakened at a relative low temperature, which prompts the strain transfer into austenite and induces the strain hardening due to its restricted softening. Accordingly, interactions between the strain hardening in austenite and weakened softening of ferrite leads to one or more platforms of Q formed at the medium stage of deformation (1 - 30 s- 1). The processing map shows that two flow instability regions appear at high strain rate {{due to the lack of}} sufficient response time for dynamic restoration at the early deformation stage. As the strain increases, dynamic softening mechanism is activated at a higher temperature, resulting in a gradually narrowed flow instability region. Differently, a decrease in temperature suppresses dynamic softening of the alloy with a high strain rate, which deteriorates the <b>hot</b> <b>workability</b> of the alloy and induces microcrack formation after straining of 0. 8...|$|E

It {{was found that the}} sulfidation behavior, especially the penetrating behavior into the alloys, was greatly influenced by aluminum, and that the resistance could be improved by increasing the aluminum content in the alloys. Six types of alloys, in which aluminum had been increased to improve the sulfidation resistance of AISI 685 and titanium decreased by the same proportion to maintain the high temperature strengths of AlSI 685, were forged to test their sulfidation behavior and high temperature strengths. As a result, the alloy with 1. 5 percent titanium and 3. 0 percent aluminum showed only half the sulfidation depth of AISI 685, for the tensile characteristics at 538 ?C, and at 850 ?C through 1100 ?C, equivalent or better than those of AISI 685.

The fact that the strain will not impact the workability obviously for the little change of the stable regions of the processing maps in different strains was discussed. Finally, an overall consideration was given in the processing maps and the optimized workability of TA 2 should be within the strain rate range of 0. 5 – 1 [*]s− 1 and temperature range of 900 °C– 925 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} {{maps are}} being developed for use in optimising <b>hot</b> <b>workability</b> and controlling the microstructure of the product. The present investigation deals with the examination to assess the prediction of the processing maps for a 15 Cr- 15 Ni- 2. 2 Mo- 0. 3 Ti austenitic stainless steel using forging and rolling tests at different temperatures {{in the range of}} 600 - 1200 degreesC. The tensile properties of these deformed products were evaluated at room temperature. The influence of the processing conditions, i. e. strain rate and temperature on the tensile properties of the deformed product were analysed to identify the optimum processing parameters. The results have shown good agreement between the regimes exhibited by the map and the properties of the rolled or forged product. The optimum parameters for processing of this steel were identified as rolling or press forging at temperatures above 1050 degreesC to obtain optimum product properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.
