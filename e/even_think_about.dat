5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

500|$|... 2005: After the Packers {{got off to}} a slow start, {{rumors that}} Favre might retire started to escalate. Favre responded by saying [...] "At 0-3, I think most people would say 'Oh, he's gone after this year, or they won't even want him back.'...I don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> when that time might come." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Morrison told Ritchie Yorke, {{one of his}} biographers, {{he wrote}} both of the songs [...] "Madame George" [...] and [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] in stream of {{consciousness}}: [...] " [...] just came right out...The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, as is 'Cyprus Avenue'...I didn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what I was writing." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN.com {{felt that}} Just Dance was [...] "an {{experience}} so devoid of depth or even basic game concepts {{that it would}} be considered a rip-off even if {{it was one of those}} Chinese knock-off systems masquerading as an existing console", further criticizing the game for its basic gameplay mechanics, [...] "sloppy" [...] motion detection, lack of variation or unlockable content, and ironically excluding the Lady Gaga song the game's title references. IGN concluded by urging readers not to buy, rent, or <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Just Dance, [...] "lest someone at Ubisoft find out and they prep a Just Dance 2. Such would be the end of all things, mark my words." ...|$|E

500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't be bothered to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> girls' hair styles". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|With the album, Badu {{sought to}} augment her music's production, expose {{the work of}} {{underground}} hip hop producers, and exceed listeners' expectations of contemporary music. She explained to Billboard that [...] "in taking on a project like this, I'm taking the responsibility to talk for my race and my planet." [...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... against your inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've always taken my time between albums. I'm a performing artist - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy. I like to write a lot while I'm on the road before I <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> recording." [...] Badu also said that she now had a relevant message to express for listeners and was no longer struggling with a creative block.|$|E

2500|$|William G. O'Neill {{comments}} that the resolution's wording was also intended [...] "to reassure Republic of Macedonia, {{which has a}} substantial Albanian minority, that its territorial borders were not at risk.

500|$|Although he {{suggested}} Justice Kennedy's concurrence may be [...] "more consequential" [...] than Justice Harry Blackmun's dissent in Callins v. Collins, Mark Joseph Stern described Justice Kennedy's concurrence as [...] "myopic", noting that [...] "large {{chunks of the}} 'legal academy' in the 'public' were aware—and outraged—by the practice long before Kennedy condemned it". Dahlia Lithwick wrote that even though [...] "Kennedy may not come around on the death penalty" [...] and rule it unconstitutional, [...] "after reading his own words in Ayala—he probably should". In an interview with Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow, Justice Kennedy explained {{that when he was}} in the Army, he was locked in a cell for four hours and [...] "slightly tortured". Justice Kennedy remarked that [...] "fter four hours in a cell, I was going mad. These people are in, some for 40 years. It drives people mad and we don’t <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. We’ve got to do something about it".|$|E
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she [...] "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much of the time. I couldn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> technique, I just had to keep looking at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the story}} lines differ when {{comparing}} {{the song and}} the legend, both integrate common themes such as loneliness and despair. One popular interpretation of the song is of the singer feeling trapped by this woman (La Llorona) who has {{fallen in love with}} him. If he <b>even</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> leaving her, she weeps. He tries everything in his power to leave her, but he is trapped by pity for the woman. He wishes to be taken down to the river to be drowned, and so then his suffering can finally end. The suffering that the man goes through from being trapped in a relationship with a woman in a way parallels the suffering that the woman in the legend goes through from having her lover leave her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't," [...] Margaret Duffe said. [...] "You {{might as}} well not <b>even</b> bother to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] She signalled to the troops and they pulled Reinhart and Dixon roughly out of the room, two dazed figures, snarling and resentful.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very strange," [...] {{continued}} Miss Lillycrop, {{giving a}} few hasty touches to her cap and hair; [...] "and do you know, I {{could not help}} thinking {{that there was something}} queer about his appearance? I can scarce tell what it was. It seemed to me like--like--but it is disagreeable <b>even</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> such things in connection with one who is such a fine, clever, gentlemanly fellow--but--" ...|$|R
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and I know when I like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{family was}} crudely drawn, because Groening had {{submitted}} basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The entire Simpson family was {{designed so that}} they would be recognizable in silhouette. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. Marge's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and [...] "not thinking that [...] would eventually be drawn in color" [...] gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head. Lisa's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline. While designing Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't be bothered to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> girls' hair styles". When designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color". Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as The Simpsons shorts), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.|$|E
5000|$|Darren R. Rousar, {{former student}} of Richard Lack and Charles Cecil {{as well as}} the author of Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach, agrees and defines {{measuring}} in broad terms. He says that [...] "a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or <b>even</b> consciously <b>think</b> <b>about</b> literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature." ...|$|R

50|$|When a {{damaging}} memo {{which is}} critical of the President is discovered, the White House press cover it with zest, much to CJ's dismay. Later it is revealed that Mandy wrote it when she was working for Lloyd Russell. Sam, Toby and Josh {{are involved in a}} series of meetings which go nowhere and result in nothing; Sam knows no progress is possible on getting a policy in place so that gays and lesbians can openly serve in the military; Josh confronts a group of Republican Congressional staffers who threaten him with poison-pill legislation if he <b>even</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> pushing for campaign finance reformers on two newly opened Federal Election Commission seats; and Toby screams to Leo that they've had only one victory in office and that was putting Judge Mendoza on the Supreme Court. The staffers and the President feel listless and ineffectual in their jobs, and worry that they will be unable to achieve anything meaningful due to the constraints of the political system.|$|R

60|$|In {{all this}} she spoke most truthfully, for she hated her step-daughter, both {{because she was}} a fine young woman and much {{regarded}} by her father, and because she had certain rights to the estate of said father, which his present wife did not wish to recognise, or <b>even</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> So Martin Newcombe was perfectly welcome to take away such things as would render it unnecessary for the girl to now return to the home in which she had been born.
