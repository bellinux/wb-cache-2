During the leadership of university presidents Michael Sovern and George Erik Rupp, many of Columbia College's facilities were extensively expanded and renovated. The number of residence halls was increased to accommodate all Columbia College students for all four years of the undergraduate education.

Therefore, interpretation on the law of evidence by judge strongly influence how far of evidence which was not mentioned in the legislation could be used by judges. This is because, in the property cases, evidence that used as listed by law is more less than criminal cases. In order to achieve this objective, few methodologies can be used such as scurutinising and analyzing of existing laws, go on to ensure that they are compatible with the books written by Islamic Scholars (Ulama). After going through such analysis, Researcher concludes that even if the laws are not contradicting with the Shariah law, there is still a need for a more thorough study so as to ensure its relevance to date, there is still so much more to be done...|$|R
