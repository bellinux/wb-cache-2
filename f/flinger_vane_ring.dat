40|$|An {{optimization}} at {{the lower}} off-design mass flow range of the radial-inflow variable geometry turbine is required for future turbine applications. One of these applications is using this type of turbine as the throttling apparatus for a spark ignition engine to recover energy which is wasted by the conventional throttle. A wide operating mass flow range with significant turbine efficiency is needed for these applications. The stator-to-rotor interaction is optimized of a standard radial-inflow turbine by changing the variable-vane-angle stator <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> geometry. The flow at the conventional and a new design stator <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> is analyzed using particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{with the intention of}} using the results to substantiate the increase of performance of the new turbine with new designed stator <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> and for the admittance of computational fluid dynamic simulations. A PIV experimental setup is built to visualize the jet flow between and directly downstream the stator vanes. Two-dimensional steady-state jet-flow characteristics are mapped at several stator vane positions. Two series of fixed positioned stator <b>vane</b> <b>rings</b> are fabricated by rapid prototyping which represent the original and new variable-vane-angle stators. The flow characteristics of both series of <b>vane</b> <b>rings</b> are compared...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates a {{variable}} geometry (VG) mixed flow turbine with a novel, purposely designed pivoting nozzle <b>vane</b> <b>ring.</b> The nozzle <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> was matched to the 3 -dimensional {{aspect of the}} mixed flow rotor leading edge with lean stacking. It was found that for a nozzle <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> in a volute, the vane surface pressure is highly affected by the flow in the volute rather than the adjacent vane surface interactions, especially at closer nozzle positions. The performance of the VG mixed flow turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG mixed flow turbine shows higher peak efficiency and swallowing capacity at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent straight vane arrangement shows a higher swallowing capacity but similar efficiencies. The VG turbine unsteady performance was found to deviate substantially from the quasi-steady assumption compared to a nozzleless turbine. This is more evident in the higher vane angle settings (smaller nozzle passage), where there are high possibility of choking during a pulse cycle. The presented steady and unsteady results {{are expected to be}} beneficial in the design of variable geometry turbochargers, especially the ones with a mixed flow turbin...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft engines are, by definition, {{designed}} for high service life duty. However {{as part of}} in-service maintenance, some components have shown, upon inspection, wear and localised cracking thus requiring repair or replacement. An understanding {{of the source of}} stress or loading is required in order to assess the effect of the crack, to see if further propagation will result. Such cracks have been found on a compressor <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> associated with a turboprop engine. It is necessary to establish the origin of the stresses that have been leading to cracks and subsequent failures observed throughout the component. Due to the complexity of the shape of the component, a finite element approach was adopted and the component modelled and analysed for a series of representative load cases. The results and outcomes are presented herein. In addition, some guidance is given on the construction, development and verification of a three dimensional finite element model for use in compressor vane design. The stresses in the compressor <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> arise from pressure and thermal actions, with the thermal action generating the highest stresses. However, {{in order to determine the}} magnitude of the thermal loading, some in-service experiments were undertaken using a full size test engine. Thermal characteristics were established using a thermal paint and suitable calibration specimens. Thereafter, these loads were applied to the finite element model of a single blade and thereafter the entire ring. The largest thermal transients occur during start-up and shutdown, along with the full power condition, which may happen during flight. Each of these cases was analysed as part of a full thermal parameter study. In each case, the location, magnitude and direction of the maximum stresses was recorded and comparisons made with the damage observed in the real structure. As a result, some recommendations have been made on the design and approach to repair of the <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> for improved service life performance...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} a Variable Geometry Turbine at low massflow rates the vaneless space of the vanes is reduced. It is researched if this modification can reduce turbo lag. A turbine with modified <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> is installed in the exhaust of a naturally aspirated engine and wide open throttle accelerations are performed to test the turbine performance. The new (reduced vaneless space) vane configuration induced a lower exhaust backpressure which allowed the engine to accelerate faster. The acceleration from 1500 to 3000 RPM was an average of 8 % faster for the new vane configuration. This in turn increased the massflow rate through the turbine which caused the power available to the turbine to be similar in compared <b>vane</b> <b>rings.</b> The initial turbine speeds was lower for the new vane configuration but it quickly {{caught up with the}} conventional configuration because the turbine acceleration was higher. The turbine efficiency was higher for the new vane configuration in most cases. The mean increase in turbine efficiency during the initial acceleration was 4 %. The turbine efficiency {{at the end of the}} acceleration was similar for both vane configurations. These experiments indicate that it is probable that decreasing the vaneless space in a variable geometry turbine will increase turbine performance during vehicle acceleration...|$|R

40|$|The {{cold air}} test program was {{completed}} on the SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engine) HPFTP (High Pressure Fuel Turbopump) turbine with production nozzle <b>vane</b> <b>rings</b> and polished coated rotor blades {{with a smooth}} surface finish of 30 microinch (0. 76 micrometer) RMS (Root Mean Square). The smooth blades were polished by an abrasive flow machining process. The test results were compared with the air test results from production rough coated rotor blades with a surface finish of up to 400 microinch (10. 16 micrometer) RMS. Turbine efficiency was higher for the smooth blades over the entire range tested. Efficiency increased 2. 1 percentage points at the SSME 104 percent RPL (Rated Power Level) condition. This efficiency improvement could reduce the SSME HPFTP turbine inlet temperature by 57 degrees Rankine (32 degrees Kelvin) increasing turbine durability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} flow mechanisms in an aggressive interturbine transition duct with and without low-profile vortex generators flow control. The interturbine duct had an area ratio of 1. 53 and a mean rise angle of 35 deg. Measurements were made inside the annulus at a Reynolds number of 150, 000. At the duct inlet, the background turbulence intensity was raised to 2. 3 % and a uniform swirl angle of 20 deg was established with a 48 -airfoil <b>vane</b> <b>ring.</b> Results for the baseline case (no vortex generators) showed the flow structures within the duct were dominated by counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separation in both the casing and hub regions. The combination of the adverse pressure gradient at the casing's first bend and upstream low momentum wakes caused the boundary layer to separate on the casing. The separated flow on the casing appears to reattach at the second bend. Counter-rotating and corotating vortex generators were installed on the casing. While both vortex generators significantly decreased the casing boundary layer separation with consequential reduction of overall pressure losses, the corotating configuration {{was found to be}} more effective.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{combined}} numerical-experimental methodology {{for the analysis}} of the lubrication regime and wear that occur between <b>vanes</b> and pressure <b>ring</b> in variable displacement vane pumps. The knowledge of the lubrication regime is essential for the improvement of the performance of high pressure vane pumps by reducing wear, increasing the volumetric efficiency and decreasing maintenance costs. Tests using pressure rings of different materials were carried out in order to identify the best material in terms of wear and friction. The proposed methodology is based on Archard’s law and takes advantage of wear experimental measurements, an empirical model for the estimation of contact pressure forces and hardness standard tests. The results of the analysis state that low wear and reduced friction can be obtained if elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication between <b>vanes</b> and pressure <b>ring</b> is established. Results have been also verified by analytical elasto-hydrodynamic models...|$|R

Abstract: The operating conditions of liquid ring vacuum pumps and factors which influence the vacuum treatment process efficiency have been considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first experimental measurements on an engine representative nozzle guide vane, {{of a new}} film cooling hole geometry, a Converging Slot-Hole or Console. The patented console geometry is designed to improve the heat transfer and aerodynamic performance of turbine vane and rotor blade cooling systems. These experiments follow the successful validation of the console design in low-speed flatplate tests described in Part 1 of this paper (Sargison et al [1]). Stereolithography was used to manufacture a resin model of a transonic, engine representative nozzle guide vane in which 7 rows of previously tested fan-shaped film-cooling holes were replaced by 4 rows of consoles. This vane was mounted in the annular <b>vane</b> <b>ring</b> of the Oxford Cold Heat Transfer Tunnel for testing at engine Reynolds numbers, Mach numbers and coolant to mainstream momentum flux ratios using a heavy gas to simulate the correct coolant to mainstream density ratio. Heat transfer data were measured using wide band thermochromic liquid crystals and a modified analysis technique. Both surface heat transfer coefficient and the adiabatic cooling effectiveness were derived from computervideo records of hue changes during the transient tunnel run. The cooling performance, quantified by the heat flux at engine temperature levels, of the console vane compares favourably {{with that of the}} previously tested vane with fan-shaped holes. The new console film cooling hole geometry offers advantages to the engine designer due to a superior aerodynamic efficiency over the fan-shaped hole geometry. These efficiency measurements are demonstrated by results from mid span traverses of a four hole pyramid probe downstream of the nozzle guide vane...|$|R

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} {{vane pumps}} represent {{one of the}} most innovative type of pump for automotive engines. The vane pump with a sliding ring, is a mechanism that makes it possible to change the capacity of the pump {{as a function of the}} engine speed, allowing to optimize of the oil flow, according to the engine demand, with considerable power saving. The main components of a variable displacement vane pumps are: <b>vanes,</b> rotor, inner <b>rings</b> and a sliding ring. During operation, the vanes are in contact with the inner surface of the outer (sliding) ring due to the effect of centrifugal loads; in addition high slip velocities occur in the contact area; as a consequence, a critical aspect of this kind of pumps is represented by the wear which takes place on the contact surfaces. Another potential mechanism of damaging process is attributed to vanes sticking in rotor cavities, causing a sudden increase in contact loads. This paper illustrates a summary of a research activity, which was carried out with the aim of analyzing the operating conditions of vanes pumps. The study was conducted with reference to pumps with vanes number ranging from 5 to 9, in order to evidence the influence of some design parameters on results. The numerical analysis were carried out by using multi-body models, that were developed with MSC. Adams® code. In these analyses any effect of the viscous oil inside the pump was neglected, focusing the attention on mechanisms geometry; moreover, the hypothesis of plane analysis was assumed. Some experimental tests were also carried out with a prototype, which was tested up to very hard conditions in order to highlight wear and damage mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Many pumping {{stations}} in drainage & irrigation applications are currently equipped with conventional (not fish friendly designed) pumps. Field tests {{have been performed}} [1] for several pump types of a certain size at certain pumping conditions to assess survival rates of fish passing through pumps. In order to compare different pump types of different sizes at different pumping conditions, a general criterion is required. Testing of fish friendliness of pumps is expensive and involves animal tests with living fish for which permits are required. Therefore, pump manufacturers prefer to perform fish friendliness tests for a single pump size. In order to convert such results to other pump sizes, a scaling law is desired. Van Esch [2, 3] made a first attempt to address scaling principles for fish friendliness of pumps. In {{the current study a}} general criterion is described to predict fish friendliness of pumps by means of models of mortality rates of fish passing through pumps. The criterion is validated with literature data [1 – 3] and experimental full-scale test data from the newly developed fish-friendly axial flow concrete volute pump by Flowserve with an impeller diameter of 850 mm. The full-scale tests involved a total of 1800 roach, perch and eel deployed over 7 pumping conditions, including 3 different heads and 5 different rotational speeds. The fish-friendliness criterion includes different aspects that together predict the survival rate of fish passing through pumps. The first and most important contributor is the impeller, which can have an axial, mixed or radial flow design. The criterion involves the leading edge shape of the blades. Secondly, the diffuser or volute is considered, which provides a strike probability with diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s). In case the gap between the trailing edge of the impeller vanes and {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s) is small relative to the fish size, there is the possibility of a “scissor” effect. Research in the USA for fish friendliness of hydropower turbines [4 – 7] showed that shear velocity and pressure drops can be of importance. Also cavitation (involves pressure drop & vapor bubble implosions), recirculation and turbulence can influence survival rates. At this stage these flow effects are roughly captured using the pump performance curve. This way, extensive CFD calculations to evaluate detailed flow effects can be avoided. For open impellers, the gap between the impeller <b>vanes</b> and wear <b>ring</b> is included in the criterion. In addition, fish species-dependent effects are taken into account, since fish vary widely in their internal and external building plan. For instance salmonid, percid and cyprinid fish respond differently to the same pump design than for example eel. Sharp edges and rough surfaces (for example caused by cavitation, erosion or corrosion) can also be harmful to fish but are not included at this stage...|$|R
