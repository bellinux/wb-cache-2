25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E

Lewis told fans, [...] "I can't wait for you guys to start remixing 'Trouble'. It is such an important song to me and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will put all your creative talents into it! I'm looking forward to hearing what you come up with and don't forget there are some great prizes to be won too!" [...] Lewis and Fraser T Smith (co-producer and co-writer of the song) were amongst the judges for the shortlisted songs. Matty Graham won the competition, and his remix of [...] "Trouble" [...] was released alongside the original version as part of a Digital EP available exclusively to MyPlayDirect.com, Lewis' official music store.|$|E

500|$|A hadith records that, {{when the}} second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said {{in front of all}} assembled: [...] "No doubt, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to you. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> care for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E

2500|$|The Court told four {{students}} to consider applying for admission {{in a year}} or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: [...] "Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will keep on trying wherever you are.

2500|$|In a December 2013 article, Pravit {{reminded}} middle-class Bangkok {{opponents of}} the Yingluck Shinawatra regime [...] "that {{that you are not}} the majority of the people, and that Bangkok is just one part of Thailand.... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> middle class and well-heeled Bangkokians are used to snapping your fingers and having your maids, drivers, waitresses and even sex workers jump to satisfy you. It must be such a pain to see these people turning the tables and dictating the course of Thai politics.... Some of you say these 'red-shirt buffaloes' are too stupid to be allowed to vote—a privilege that should only go to college-educated Thais or the middle class". He compared this attitude to the apartheid system. [...] "The poor and less-educated Thais in rural areas and in Bangkok want their political opinions counted as well. A lorry with 10 wheels cannot move forward with just one wheel dictating the speed. And so it is with Thailand". He called on his fellow Bangkokians to [...] "try harder to convince them through civil dialogue, rather than engaging in bouts of expletive-loaded hate speech and showing open indifference to loss of life of among protesters who don't share your political opinions. We need to give a space for our fragile and young democracy to grow and mature. And that means employing legitimate democratic means in opposing Thaksin and Yingluck—no military coup and no mob rule, please".|$|E
