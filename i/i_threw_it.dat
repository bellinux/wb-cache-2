And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> right down the middle. [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not going {{to break up a}} perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} wonderfully good and kind to me,' said Bella, 'and I kiss it for that. You {{have been as}} bad as bad could be to Mr Rokesmith, and <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away for that. Thank you for myself, and good-bye!' ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this has}} {{very little to do}} with my story: <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> in as a {{classical}} allusion, to meet the demands of a literary fashion which has its origin in the generous eagerness of writers to give the public more than it pays for. But the story of Androcles was a favourite with the bear whose adventures I am about to relate.|$|R

She said, [...] "I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for Affair in Trinidad and <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> across the room. But I did the picture, and Pal Joey, too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn owned me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Sheridan, {{who scored}} the {{controversial}} goal, described {{how he had}} done it: [...] "It was well-worked {{and it was a}} definite goal. People are saying <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> in, but I was heading for the line and I just dropped the ball and it was in the net. I got it and the lad just pushed me into the net. I tried to do whatever I could to hit it and the goal was given, simple as that. I was pushed in over the line so it should have been a penalty anyway. I think it was a perfect goal".|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{was adopted}} and raised by Ella Lane, {{who also had}} four other children. As a youth in Austin, Lane grew up poor, busing tables at local hotels and shining shoes on Congress Avenue. [...] He also helped his mother with a laundry {{business}} {{she ran out of}} the home. [...] Lane became known as [...] "Cue Ball" [...] and later recalled how he acquired the nickname: [...] "I was in a pool hall in 12th street. We were playing for money, maybe a dime. As soon as I made the eight ball, the other guy took off running. He didn't want to pay. I grabbed that cue ball and just as he made the corner <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> and hit him upside the head. The guy didn't know what had hit him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Billy, you're a smart boy--a knowing young rascal," [...] replied Mr Jones, nodding approval; [...] "of {{course they}} cost something, but {{therein lies the}} advantage. The whole affair, sloop an' cargo, ain't worth {{more than a few}} pounds; so, if <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> all away, it will be only losing a few pounds for the sake of gaining three hundred. What think you of that, lad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' he said, after {{thinking}} a little. 'Don't throw the club at all. <b>I</b> will <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> a second time, {{and that will}} do just as well.' ...|$|R

[...] And he sent the little spear whirling round and round in the air. Every eye watched it as it wheeled and fell. The haft struck the ground first.|$|R
2500|$|Demeter {{had another}} {{multiple}} home run game in an 11-0 {{win over the}} Phillies. Don's bat eventually slowed down, but he still had well above average numbers for the months of May and June, hitting a combined [...]278 with 10 home runs and 34 RBI. Once summer hit its full stride, however, Don countered his three-month offensive production with two months of offensive despair, hitting below [...]160 in both months and having only 2 home runs. The bad luck reached its height on August 18 when he dropped an [...] "easy" [...] pop fly against the Milwaukee Braves {{in the bottom of}} the 9th inning. The Braves tied the game, but the Dodgers later won it 7-6 in 13 innings. Demeter attempted to stop the tying run from coming home, but the catcher had thought the game was over. He said later, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> to home plate, it was a perfect strike. But there was nobody there to catch it, because (Johnny) Roseboro was out at the mound congratulating (Don) Drysdale on the victory." [...] On the bus ride to the hotel, Demeter shook every one of his teammate's hands, showing his appreciation for [...] "the team's win". At season's end they were tied with the Braves for the National League pennant. They won the playoff and a berth in the World Series. Demeter later said, [...] "My error could have lost us the World Championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{begin the}} fourth quarter, the Texas Tech defense forced a Nebraska fourth down and 1 in field goal range. The Cornhuskers {{brought out the}} kicker but faked the field goal and passed for a first down to the 1-yard line. Nebraska's Joe Ganz then scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to pull Nebraska within 7 points with 12:10 {{remaining}} in the fourth quarter. After a Red Raider punt, the Cornhuskers once again drove the field and scored on a Ganz 2-yard pass to Dreu Young {{to tie the game}} at 2424. On the very next drive by Texas Tech, the Cornhuskers forced the Red Raiders to a fourth down with 5 yards to go on Texas Tech's own 36-yard line. Mike Leach decided to go for it, and Harrell found Crabtree again for a 47-yard reception keeping the drive alive. Harrell later said of the play, [...] "If he was just a little covered, I would go to him. <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> up there and he made the play." [...] A few plays later, Harrell scored on a 1-yard run to give the Red Raiders the lead 3124. Nebraska then drove the field 79 yards in 8 plays and scored on a 17-yard pass from Ganz to Todd Peterson to tie the game at 31 a piece with 29 seconds remaining in the game. Texas Tech failed to score on the next drive and the game went into overtime.|$|E

5000|$|His curveball was {{a common}} 2-strike offering, and his changeup was {{frequently}} used in those counts to right-handed hitters. He also often used the change {{as a substitute for}} a fastball when he was behind in the count. He liked to work his fastball high in the strike zone: [...] "It's often the best pitch for me to throw to a guy who is sitting on a fastball. If <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> high, a lot of times he'll swing and not catch up to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, {{but he was just}} as unselfish and kind as he could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, never once recollecting that <b>I</b> <b>throwed</b> <b>it</b> out myself because it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!"

60|$|In short, <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> {{out as a}} {{conjecture}} {{more than}} as an ascertained fact, it is true, but from all I have seen in Europe, I am induced to think that, in making our experiments on the vine, we have been too ambitious to obtain a fat soil, and too warp of the higher latitudes of the country. A gravelly hill-side, in the interior, that has been well stirred, and which has the proper exposure, I cannot but thing would bring good wine, in all the low countries of the middle states.|$|R
