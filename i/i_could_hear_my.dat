[...] "There {{were a lot of}} cooks in the kitchen, a lot of voices around me, and I wanted to step away so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own voice again", McAdams said in 2013. [...] "Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre." [...] During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Casino Royale (2006), [...] (2006) and Get Smart (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage {{appearance}} in The Vagina Monologues at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.|$|E

60|$|Then, hardly {{daring to}} look and yet unable to turn away my eyes, I saw a figure dimly {{outlined}} in the corner upon which the stair opened. There was a silence in which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> poor heart thumping, and then when I looked again the figure was gone, and the low creak, creak was heard once more upon the stairs.

6000|$|... "Years before, when I {{was only}} {{eight or ten}} years old, I had met your mother with your family at the seaside, where my mother took me. I had seen {{a great deal of}} her, and knew all about her. I remembered well her {{habitual}} consideration for the nurses and servants in her employ. I knew her address in Boston, and I resolved {{to try to find a}} refuge in her family. And so there is my story. I left a note with my stepmother, saying that I was going to seek independent employment, and then went to Boston to your house. There I hoped to find a quiet asylum,--at least, till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>my</b> aunt in Scotland.

The object of these scoundrels was {{to get hold of}} the poor ignorant people's homesteads, and they were in league with the local usurers. They exported their victims through Hamburg mostly. As to the ship, I had watched her out of this very window, reaching close-hauled under short canvas into the bay on a dark, threatening afternoon. She came to an anchor, correctly by the chart, off the Brenzett Coastguard station. I remember before the night fell looking out again at the outlines of her spars and rigging that stood out dark and pointed on a background of ragged, slaty clouds like another and a slighter spire {{to the left of the}} Brenzett church-tower.

But the time was not long to wait. I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair. This she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.|$|E
6000|$|I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I {{took one}} slow {{step at a}} time and there warn't a sound, only I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart.

40|$|Based on "Veni Creator Spiritus", plainsong, and {{arranged}} for the Albuquerque Boy Choir, which premiered it November 7, 1998 in Albuquerque, with the composer conducting. Voicing/Instrumentation: SATB (SSAT), pno. ASCAP Title Code: 030086541. Date Composed: 1998. Copyright: 1999 Neil A Kjos Music Co (4380 Jutland Drive, San Diego, CA 92117, www. kjos. com). Duration: 3 : 33. Score/Parts: Neil A Kjos Music Co. I {{had been looking for}} a text to set for my boy choir the next season. A week before taking them to England, I was in church singing the hymn 'Come, Holy Spirit' and thinking that the spirit that children bring to music is from God. Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>my</b> head a flowing piano accompaniment for the hymn tune [...] something to match and complement the choir's own beauty {{as well as that of}} the tune itself. Though other projects waited on the shelf, this piece was finished in a matter of hours. All of us are visited by the creative forces of the Holy Spirit all of the time. But we don't always pay attention. Digitized with funding from the Center for Regional Studies...|$|R
60|$|That was a {{long summer}} indeed. And tho' Wilmot House was closed, I often rode over of a morning when the dew was on the grass. It cheered me to smoke a pipe with old McAndrews, Mr. Manners's factor, who loved to talk of Miss Dorothy near as much as I. He had served her grandfather, and people said that {{had it not been}} for McAndrews, the Manners fortune had long since been scattered, since Mr. Marmaduke knew nothing of {{anything}} that he should. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> from <b>my</b> lady until near the first of October, and so I was fain to be content with memories--memories and hard work.

When Mr. Pendril wished {{to speak to you}} about Norah and me, his letter gave us our choice to be present at the interview, or to keep away. If my elder sister decided to keep away, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> come? How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own story except as I did? My {{listening}} has done no harm.

60|$|I didn't laugh--I {{am always}} thankful for that--but the strain {{ruptured}} every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> bones clack when I walked. She {{never found out}} her mistake. The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given order for it: that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality, in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake. This was not true. But it answered.|$|E
60|$|The carpet! It {{had been}} a stout article in its time, had evidently began in a drawing-room; then descended to a coffee-room; then gone upstairs {{altogether}} to a bedroom. The ground was brown, and the pattern was bunches of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances. I reckoned up the bunches. Ten along the room--eight across it. When I had stepped out five one way and four the other, and was {{down on my knees}} on the center bunch, as true as I sit on this chair <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me.|$|E
60|$|While Maud {{was passing}} me the {{provisions}} and I was storing {{them in the}} boat, a sailor came on deck from the forecastle. He stood by the weather rail for a time (we were lowering over the lee rail), and then sauntered slowly amidships, where he again paused and stood facing the wind, with his back toward us. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart beating as I crouched low in the boat. Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying motionless, her body {{in the shadow of}} the bulwark. But the man never turned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I {{went into}} the city to look upon the face of every man. But they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not count them. And the noise smote upon me till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear,</b> and <b>my</b> head was dizzy with much movement. So I went on and on, through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine; where the harvests lay rich on the plains; and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women, with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold. And all the while my people of Akatan hunted and fished, and were happy in {{the thought that the}} world was small.|$|R
60|$|These {{inquiries}} took us {{up three}} or four weeks, and I was not one jot the better for it, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing to <b>my</b> satisfaction. I sent her next {{to find out the}} honest man who, as in the beginning of my story I observed, made them be entertained, and caused the youngest to be fetched from the town where we lived, and where the parish officers had taken care of him. This gentleman was still alive; and there she heard that my youngest daughter and eldest son was dead also; but that my youngest son was alive, and was at that time about seventeen years old, and that he was put out apprentice by the kindness and charity of his uncle, but to a mean trade, and at which he was obliged to work very hard.|$|R

60|$|With that {{he began}} his search. It might have been ludicrous if I had had any desire to laugh, for the chief wore the gingerly air of a man looking for a {{rattlesnake}} which has to be got somehow. And my client assisted at the inspection with all the graces of a dancing-master. McCann poked into the forward lockers where we kept the stores,--dropping the iron lid {{within an inch of}} his toe,--and the clothing-lockers and the sail-lockers. He reached under the bunks, and drew out his hand again quickly, as though he expected to be bitten. And at last he stood by the trap with the hole in it, under which the Celebrity lay prostrate. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own breathing. But Mr. Cooke had his wits about him still, and at this critical juncture he gave McCann a thump on the back which nearly carried him off his feet.|$|E
60|$|The {{concern in}} which I fell {{instantly}} on this address put {{me with the}} same swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and the light made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the student of Heineccius. Doubtless {{she was more than}} usually hurt; and I know for myself I found it more than usually difficult to maintain my strangeness. Even at the meal I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again to my civilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than before. Methought, as I read, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart strike like an eight-day clock. Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona. She sat on the floor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and shone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder of fine hues. Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then again at me: and at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church.|$|E

My heels knocked {{together}} {{like a pair of}} clappers, an' it seemed to me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> head crack, the same way a whip does when you snap it. Well, after the old feller got through paralyzin' me, an' I was kind er steady on my feet once more, he told me to go to work an' clean out the stable. Why, Teddy, the job he set me at would have taken three men a month; an' he 'lowed I was to have it all done before night! You see, I didn't have any dinner, an' had heard so much 'bout how they lived in the country that I thought I'd kind er like to sample the cookin'. So I asked him if he didn't think {{it would be best to}} have some grub before I tackled sich a job as that.

60|$|July 7th. There {{was a heavy}} swell {{running all}} this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many {{articles}} broke loose in the hold, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> distinctly from <b>my</b> hiding-place. I suffered {{a great deal from}} sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brigs straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak.|$|R

"When {{my brother}} left us yesterday, he {{imagined}} that the business which took him to London might be concluded {{in three or four}} days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, {{and at the same time}} convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> that you, <b>my</b> dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of that I despair.

5000|$|Lights & Motion {{was formed}} in Gothenburg, Sweden in early 2012 by native {{musician}} Christoffer Franzén. Originally meant as an outlet {{during a period of}} insomnia, the project was supposed to reflect the sense of a dreamlike state in which a lot of the first album was written in.However, the project quickly garnered a lot of attention online, mainly in the alternative and postrock scene, which led to them being signed by famous American independent record label Deep Elm Records, previously home to bands such as The Appleseed Cast and other prominent alternative acts. Originally a guitarist, Franzén started to experiment with writing and recording music by himself in 2011/2012, and soon {{came to the conclusion that}} just writing with the guitar was too limiting. This led to him being forced to quickly pick up all the other instruments that he felt he needed, in order to fill the space that he heard in his head. [...] I would try all these different instruments and record myself over and over in layers, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it sound huge and not just like one guy in a dark room. I just had such a need for control and I knew exactly what I wanted, so I ended up doing every single thing by myself. I learned all the instruments I needed for what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>my</b> head, and I recorded and recorded and recorded until my ears bled, and slowly I got better at it. Christoffer Franzén in an interview in 2013. Being a self-taught musician in every aspect, Christoffer also learned how to produce, engineer and mix his own works.|$|R
6000|$|How long we {{lay there}} together, we three, {{speechless}} and motionless, {{is more than}} I can tell, {{but it must have}} been for long. At length, one by one, and almost mechanically, we crawled back into the shelter of the bank. As I lay against the parapet, wholly wretched and not entirely master of my mind, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> kinsman maundering to himself in an altered and melancholy mood. Now he would repeat to himself with maudlin iteration, [...] "Sic a fecht as they had--sic a sair fecht as they had, puir lads, puir lads!" [...] and anon he would bewail that [...] "a' the gear was as gude's tint," [...] because the ship had gone down among the Merry Men instead of stranding on the shore; and throughout, the name--the Christ-Anna--would come and go in his divagations, pronounced with shuddering awe. The storm all this time was rapidly abating. In half an hour the wind had fallen to a breeze, and the change was accompanied or caused by a heavy, cold, and plumping rain. I must then have fallen asleep, and when I came to myself, drenched, stiff, and unrefreshed, day had already broken, grey, wet, discomfortable day; the wind blew in faint and shifting capfuls, the tide was out, the Roost was at its lowest, and only the strong beating surf round all the coasts of Aros remained to witness of the furies of the night.|$|E
6000|$|And {{presently}} I {{was in a}} black rage at all the irrecoverable sorrows of the past, of {{that great}} ocean of avoidable suffering of which this was but one luminous and quivering red drop. I walked {{in the garden and}} the garden was too small for me; I went out to wander on the moors. [...] "The past is past," [...] I cried, and all the while across the gulf of five and twenty years <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> poor mother's heart-wrung weeping for that daughter baby who had suffered and died. Indeed that old spirit of rebellion has not altogether died in me, for all the transformation of the new time. [...] . I quieted down at last to a thin and austere comfort in thinking that the whole is not told to us, that it cannot perhaps be told to such minds as ours; and anyhow, and what was far more sustaining, that now we have strength and courage and this new gift of wise love, whatever cruel and sad things marred the past, none of these sorrowful things that made the very warp and woof of the old life, need now go on happening. We could foresee, we could prevent and save. [...] "The past is past," [...] I said, between sighing and resolve, as I came into view again on my homeward way of the hundred sunset-lit windows of old Lowchester House. [...] "Those sorrows are sorrows no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{when the}} roar and the squall of Sabre-Tooth roused {{us where we}} squatted by our dying embers, and I was wild with far vision of the proof of the pit and the stake, it was the woman, arms about me, leg-twining, who fought with me and {{restrained}} me not to go out through the dark to my desire. She was part-clad, for warmth only, in skins of animals, mangy and fire-burnt, that I had slain; she was swart and dirty with camp smoke, unwashed since the spring rains, with nails gnarled and broken, and hands that were calloused like footpads and were more like claws than like hands; {{but her eyes were}} blue as the summer sky is, as the deep sea is, and there was that in her eyes, and in her clasped arms about me, and in her heart beating against mine, that withheld me [...] . though through the dark until dawn, while Sabre-Tooth squalled his wrath and his agony, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> comrades snickering and sniggling to their women in that I had not the faith in my emprise and invention to venture through the night to the pit and the stake I had devised for the undoing of Sabre- Tooth. But my woman, my savage mate held me, savage that I was, and her eyes drew me, and her arms chained me, and her twining legs and heart beating to mine seduced me from my far dream of things, my man's achievement, the goal beyond goals, the taking and the slaying of Sabre- Tooth on the stake in the pit.|$|E
60|$|Anscombe {{was soon}} lost in dreams, {{if he did}} dream, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not sleep well that night. I was fearful of I knew not what, and so, I think, was Lost, for he fidgeted and kept poking me with his nose. At last, I think {{it must have been}} about two hours after midnight, he began to growl. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing, {{although}} <b>my</b> ears are sharp, but as he went on growling I crept to the door-hole and drew aside the board. Lost slipped out and vanished, while I waited, listening. Presently I thought I heard a soft foot-fall and a whisper, also that I saw the shape of a woman which reminded me of Nombe, shown faintly by the starlight. It vanished in a moment and Lost returned wagging his tail, as he might well have done if it were Nombe who was attached to the dog. As nothing further happened I went back to bed, reflecting that I was probably mistaken, since Nombe had been sent away for some days by Zikali and would scarcely dare to return at once, even if she could do so.|$|R

60|$|As for my Uncle Warrington, and his virtuous {{wife and}} daughters, {{let me do}} them justice likewise, and declare that {{throughout}} my period of trial, their sorrow at my poverty was consistent and unvarying. I still had a few acquaintances who saw them, and of course (as friends will) brought me a report of their opinions and conversation; and <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>my</b> relatives had uttered one single good word about me or my wife. They spoke even of my tragedy as a crime--I was accustomed to hear that sufficiently maligned--of the author as a miserable reprobate, for ever reeling about Grub Street, in rags and squalor. They held me out no hand of help. My poor wife might cry in her pain, {{but they had no}} twopence to bestow upon her. They went to church a half-dozen times in the week. They subscribed to many public charities. Their tribe was known eighteen hundred years ago, and will flourish as long as men endure. They will still thank Heaven that they are not as other folks are; and leave the wounded and miserable to other succour.|$|R
