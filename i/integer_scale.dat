50|$|However, {{if we have}} a non-{{primitive}} Pythagorean triple (ka, kb, kc), where (a, b, c) is {{a primitive}} Pythagorean triple and k a positive integer, then we see that d = , so we have an integer altitude iff c | k. Such a triangle is called decomposable, as dividing it into two similar smaller triangles with that altitude yields two more Pythagorean triangles. This is because in each smaller triangle generated, the altitude of the main triangle corresponds to one of the legs of the main triangle under the rescaling, but it is an integer multiple of that leg's value in the primitive triangle, as {{can be seen from the}} equation for the altitude above, so this is our scale factor from the primitive triangle to this subtriangle. Thus, in short, each subtriangle is the result of scaling our primitive triangle by some positive <b>integer</b> <b>scale</b> factor and thus is still a Pythagorean triangle. Unfortunately, these triangles are not in general decomposable themselves, so we don't get any fractal-type pattern.|$|E

Tetlock and sociologist Charlotta Stern summarized numerous studies of how academic psychology has little ideological diversity, that {{the ratio of}} liberal-to-conservative or Democratic-to-Republican professors has dramatically increased since 1990, that the disparity is undermining the quality of research in psychology, and that the main causes {{of the lack of}} ideological diversity are self-selection, hostile climate, and discrimination. In 2014, survey data from HERI indicated that the ratio of liberal-to-conservative college professors increased from 2:1 in 1995 to roughly 5:1 in 2014. In 2016, psychologists Bill von Hippel and David Buss surveyed 335 members of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology (along a 1-to-11 <b>integer</b> <b>scale)</b> and found that 89.3% of respondents self-identified as liberal, 8.3% self-identified as centrist or moderate, and 2.5% self-identified as conservative. 94.7% of respondents voted for Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, 1.2% of respondents voted for Mitt Romney, and 4% of respondents voted for other candidates. After averaging the scores of the respondents on nine major political issues, 96% of respondents were categorized as left of center, 3.7% were categorized as centrist or moderate, and 0.3% were categorized as conservative. In September 2016, a replication and extension of the 2012 Inbar and Lammers study conducted by psychologists Nathan Honeycutt and Laura Freberg surveyed 618 faculty members of four California State University campuses and confirmed the previous finding of a hostile climate towards conservative professors in academic psychology departments, but also extended their study to 76 other academic departments spanning agricultural, business, education, arts and letters, engineering, and science colleges and found that there are sizable percentages of professors willing to discriminate against conservative academics in every academic department that they surveyed.|$|E

Self-identified conservative respondents were also more likely to feel that there was a hostile climate directed towards their political beliefs, while self-identified liberal respondents did not believe that there was a hostile climate directed towards conservative beliefs, and the more liberal the respondent self-identified as being, the less likely they were to believe that there was a hostile climate. The respondents were also asked four questions assessing (along a 1-to-7 <b>integer</b> <b>scale)</b> their personal stated willingness to discriminate against conservatives, along with how willing they thought other members of their academic department would be to discriminate against conservatives. For all but one of the questions where the respondents were speaking for themselves, and for every question where the respondent was speaking for the rest of their department, the statistical mean for the responses was more than a standard deviation above the lowest option ("not at all" [...] willing to discriminate). The percentage of responses from the middle to the highest option ("somewhat" [...] to [...] "very much" [...] willing to discriminate) ranged from 14 to 44% for each question whether respondents were speaking for themselves or for their departmental colleagues, and the highest percentages for both were to the question about hiring a conservative job applicant in their academic department if the applicant was equally qualified with a liberal applicant. Also, the more liberal the respondent self-identified as being, the more they reported being willing to discriminate against conservatives on each question.|$|E

Although the ESI and cGPS use different underlying algorithms to calculate patient severity, both utilize a five-point <b>integer</b> <b>scale</b> with level 1 representing the highest severity. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to compare cGPS results with an established gold standard in emergency triage. Methods: We conducted a blinded trial comparing triage scores from the ESI: A Triage Tool for Emergency Department Care, Version 4, Implementation Handbook to those generated by cGPS from the text of 73 sample case vignettes. A weighted, quadratic kappa statistic was used to assess agreement between cGPS derived severity scores and those published in the ESI handbook for all 73 cases. Weighted kappa concordance was defined a priori as almost perfect (kappa> 0. 8), substantial (0. 6 < kappa < 0. 8), moderate (0. 4 < kappa < 0. 6), fair (0. 2 < kappa< 0. 4), or slight (kappa < 0. 2). Results: Of the 73 case vignettes, the cGPS severity score matched the ESI handbook score in 95 % of cases (69 / 73 cases), in addition, the weighted, quadratic kappa statistic showed almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0. 93, 95 % CI 0. 854 - 0. 996).

As part of an international effort to revise how damage is quantified in vasculitis clinical research, an exercise was performed to measure expert ratings of damage items. METHODS: Members of the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium and European Vasculitis Study Group were given a list of 129 items of damage related to WG and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Participants were asked to rate each item of damage on an <b>integer</b> <b>scale</b> from 0 to 10, where 10 represented the most severe form of damage and 0 indicated 'no impact'. RESULTS: A multidisciplinary panel of 50 investigators from North America, Europe and Australia-New Zealand participated. The highest median ratings (8 - 10) were assigned to items of damage associated with malignancy, tissue ischaemia, the central nervous system and cardiopulmonary manifestations. The mean scores ranged from 1. 3 to 9. 5. The highest s. d. s (>or= 2. 5) were associated with forms of damage that may benefit from surgical intervention or may not be causally associated with WG or MPA. Lower scores were assigned by nephrologists in comparison with rheumatologists and by Americans in comparison to Europeans, although the difference in median ranks used by these groups was not statistically significant (P > 0. 05 for the comparisons).

40|$|The House of Quality (HOQ) {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} as a mechanism for capturing the Voice of the Customer and guiding the process of converting the customer's voice into internal engineering specifications. However, the discussion of this process to date has tended to be qualitative rather than quantitative. Various heuristic practices have evolved with little substantiation of their value or evaluation of their impact other than illustration in a few case studies. Examples of practices promoted by several authors and practitioners include {{the inclusion of the}} relative magnitude of effects, but not direction, {{in the body of the}} matrix; the restriction of relationships to an <b>integer</b> <b>scale</b> of subjective, ratio values; and allocating available engineering resources to the hard-to-improve characteristics (because the easy ones will presumably take care of themselves). The process for setting target specifications given the HOQ data has not been well defined either. Design teams are required to develop their own ad hoc rules. When multiple engineering characteristics affect a single customer attribute or when an engineering characteristic impacts multiple customer attributes, the design problem becomes difficult and current procedures are of little use to the design team. This is particularly true when some interactions are negative. The result may be lost opportunity from the selection of non-optimal designs. This research takes a scientific approach to optimally specifying the target values for engineering characteristics in a competitive marketplace. A methodology for building linear or nonlinear statistical models of customer preference (value) for each customer attribute followed by an optimization routine that will obtain the optimal specification of engineering characteristics is proposed. The optimization model considers economic and technological constraints as well as customer preferences. The process results in optimal, feasible design specifications. In addition the effect of variability in parameter estimates on the ability to correctly identify the key engineering characteristics for optimizing customer value is investigated. Model performance is also analyzed through random generation of 320 problem instances of varying linearity, size, density, monotonicity and correlation. Finally, the methodology is applied to a problem from industry and the results are compared with an actual, subjectively-derived design...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of feature extraction in image processing {{is caused by the}} fact that objects originating from a feature class don't always appear in a unique size, and the feature sizes are diverse.

This is achieved by matching the rational downsampling factor to the different feature sizes and matching the filter coefficients to the feature characteristics.

The algorithm detects jaggies in magnified binary images (using pixel replication) and removes them, making the edges smoother. This is done by replacing the value of specific pixels. In this paper, we extend the binary mmINT to greyscale images. The pixels are locally binarized so that the same morphological techniques can be applied as for mmINT. We take care of the more difficult replacement of pixel values, because several grey values can be part of a jaggy. We then discuss the visual results of the new greyscale method...|$|R
