5|$|In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was {{reformed}} {{with the}} aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E

5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E

25|$|His <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> for {{refugee status}} to the Refugee Status Branch (RSB) of the New Zealand Immigration Service was declined.

25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of rubberized asphalt are inconclusive. <b>Initial</b> <b>application</b> of rubberized asphalt may provide 3–5 decibels (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 decibels (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), rubberized asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.|$|E

Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen {{to take part in}} the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the European Astronaut Corps were selected - five men and one woman.|$|E

This application was turned down, but a subsequent application to the new Heritage Lottery Fund was submitted in 1999.

25|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> of {{thermodynamics}} to mechanical {{heat engines}} was extended {{early on to}} the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged in the following decades. Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics.|$|E

Subsequently, the petitioners attempted to adjourn the application, which along with the application itself was denied after a hearing by High Court judges Michael Supperstone and Robin Spencer sitting as a divisional court {{on the grounds that the}} petitioners had deliberately failed to disclose their financial means when making the <b>initial</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> for the {{television}} station was filed on October 23, 1944, when local businessman Karl Hoblitzelle, owner of movie theater chain Interstate Circuit Theatres, applied with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{to obtain a}} construction permit and license to operate a television station on VHF channel 8; {{it was the first}} such license application for a television station in the Southern United States. Hoblitzelle planned to operate the station out of the Republic Bank building in downtown Dallas, and even conducted a closed-circuit television broadcast of the opening of one of his properties, the Wilshire Theatre. Texas oil magnate Tom Potter filed a separate application for the Channel 8 license and was ultimately awarded the permit over Hoblitzelle.|$|E
25|$|Requirements {{for being}} a special constable vary from force to force. The {{recruitment}} process in Scotland is also {{significantly different from the}} process in England and Wales. It can take from as few as six to as many as eighteen months from <b>initial</b> <b>application</b> through to attestation where recruits take the Police Oath. A number of different steps are involved in the recruitment process and the order can vary from force to force. The first part of the process usually involves filling out an application form. After that, there may be a combination of entrance test (the Police Initial Recruitment Test in England and Wales or the Standard Entrance Test in Scotland), interview, security checks, fitness test and medical assessment although the exact process is force specific.|$|E
