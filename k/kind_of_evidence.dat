25|$|In linguistics, evidentiality is, broadly, the {{indication}} {{of the nature of}} evidence for a given statement; that is, whether evidence exists for the statement and if so what kind. An evidential (also verificational or validational) is the particular grammatical element (affix, clitic, or particle) that indicates evidentiality. Languages with only a single evidential have had terms such as mediative, médiatif, médiaphorique, and indirective used instead of evidential. Evidential is a meaning of nature and statement that is whether evidence exists for the statement and what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> exists.|$|E
25|$|The Cambridge version, in the {{manuscript}} known as Cambridge University Library, Ff. 1.27 ("Ff. 1.27"), is slightly later. Like the Oxford version, it is incomplete, missing chapters 29 to 34. The style of handwriting suggests that {{the text of the}} Cambridge Historia dates to the mid-12th century, though it may be as late as the early 13th century. It is written in a single hand classified as English early Gothic, typical of the period 1140–1170. Ff. 1.27 as a whole came together in the 15th century or later, but pages 1 to 236 are earlier and palaographic evidence suggests that, {{with the exception of a}} continuation of Gildas' De excidio Britanniae dating to the 14th century, share the same origin. The same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> implies that Ff. 1.27 1–236 had a common origin with half of the contents of another Cambridge manuscript, Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS. 66 ("CCCC 66"), also largely composed of Northumbrian material. It probably had a common origin with Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS. 139 ("CCCC 139") as well: the Historia of Ff. 1.27 is written in the same hand as part of CCCC 139's version of the Historia Regum (a Durham-based history of the English). This scribes behind this material may have been based at Sawley, though this is uncertain and Durham too is a possibility.|$|E

It has made it virtually impossible to challenge any aspect, criminal justice process, for racial bias in the absence of proof of intentional discrimination, conscious, deliberate bias ... Evidence of conscious intentional bias is almost impossible to come by in the absence of some kind of admission. But the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the courthouse doors are closed to claims of racial bias in the absence of that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> which has really immunized the entire criminal justice system from judicial and to a large extent public scrutiny of the severe racial disparities and forms of racial discrimination that go on every day unchecked by our courts and our legal process.|$|E

40|$|Conspiracy {{theories}} are often portrayed as unwarranted beliefs, typically supported by suspicious <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories {{is at the}} very least understandable [...] -because conspiracies occur [...] -and that if we take an evidential approach, judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits, belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases. Drawing on this work, I examine the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> typically associated with conspiracy theories, and show how the so-called evidential problems with conspiracy {{theories are}} also problems for the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> put forward in support of other theories. As such, if {{there is a problem with}} the conspiracy theorist's use <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> it is one of principle: is the principle which guides the conspiracy theorist's use <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> somehow in error? I argue that whatever we might think about conspiracy theories generally, there is no prima facie case for a scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use <b>of</b> <b>evidence...</b>|$|R

50|$|Certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> such as {{documentary}} evidence, {{are subject}} to the requirement that the offeror provide the trial judge with a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (which need not be much and it need not be very strong) suggesting that the offered item <b>of</b> tangible <b>evidence</b> (e.g., a document, a gun) is what the offeror claims it is. This authentication requirement has import primarily in jury trials. If <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> authenticity is lacking in a bench trial, the trial judge will simply dismiss the evidence as unpersuasive or irrelevant. Other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> can be self-authenticating and require nothing to prove that the item is tangible <b>evidence.</b> Examples <b>of</b> self-authenticating <b>evidence</b> includes signed and certified public documents, newspapers, and acknowledged documents.|$|R

Content validity is important for criterion-referenced measures, but it is not sufficient.
