5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} {{his view of}} the strike. He argued that he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night because the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} the strikers <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Zhu's close {{affiliation}} with Mao Zedong began in 1928 when, under {{the assistance of}} Chen Yi and Lin Biao, Zhu defected from Fan Shisheng's protection and marched his army of 10,000 men to Jiangxi and the Jinggang Mountains. Here Mao <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> soviet in 1927, and Zhu began building up his army into the Red Army, consolidating and expanding the Soviet areas of control.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|By 1:30 pm, around 1,000 monks had congregated {{inside to}} hold a meeting while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist {{students}} <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> Directorate for Administration. The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E

5|$|From 1981 to 1983, Weizsäcker {{headed a}} {{minority}} government in West Berlin, after the CDU had only won 48 per cent {{of seats in}} the state assembly. His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party, who were in a coalition with the Social Democrats {{at the federal level}} at the time. After Helmut Kohl had won the federal election in 1983 and <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> government with the Free Democrats, Weizsäcker did the same in West Berlin.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E

5|$|On July 13, 1787, the Second Continental Congress {{passed the}} Northwest Ordinance, {{creating}} the Northwest Territory which included Michigan. In 1805, the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory, with Detroit as its territorial capital. Michigan first applied for statehood {{as early as}} 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, a 468-square mile (1,210km²) area that included the important port city of Toledo. By 1835, Michigan <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The state's boundaries included the contested area.|$|E
5|$|Paul Roma began feuding with The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) {{during the}} July 21, 1990, episode of WWF Superstars. Roma was {{attacked}} after a match by Dino Bravo; when The Rockers {{came to the}} ring for the following match, Roma accused them of attacking him. The argument turned physical, and Roma was backed up by Hercules. One week later, Roma and Hercules appeared on the Brother Love Show, an interview segment, and announced that they <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> tag team known as Power and Glory. A match between the two teams was later scheduled for SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt {{became the}} Prime Minister of Sweden on 6 October 2006, serving {{concurrently}} as Leader of the Moderate Party. The 41-year old Reinfeldt {{became the youngest}} person to become Prime Minister since Rickard Sandler became Prime Minister {{at the age of}} 40 in 1925. With victories in 2006 and in 2010, Reinfeldt was the Moderate Party's longest-serving prime minister and the only person to lead the party to two consecutive general election victories. His Government compromised four parties (including his own) which prior to the election <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> coalition named Alliance for Sweden, later turned into the Alliance.|$|E

A second trailer was shown at the San Diego Comic-Con International that July. The game was released for iOS, Android OS, and Windows Phone on September 10, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{had moved}} out at dawn, {{followed}} by the 5th Mounted Brigade without ambulance support, as the New Zealand Field Ambulance had not returned from Romani and the 5th Mounted Field Ambulance had not yet arrived. Fortunately, casualties were light, and both ambulances arrived in the evening. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> dressing station at Bir Nagid {{to the south of}} Romani, treating wounded from 3rd Light Horse Brigade's engagement at Bir el Hamisah, a convoy brought in wounded Ottomans from a hod to the south of Romani, and 150 cases of heat exhaustion from infantry in the 42nd Division were treated during the day.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{achieved}} {{another breakthrough}} in 1987, {{when she had}} leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane. For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—who <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival of Look Back in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:00pm CST (19:00UTC), a line {{of violent}} {{thunderstorms}} began developing near the Wichita Mountains in Comanche County, Oklahoma. The supercell that eventually produced the first tornado of the outbreak moved northeast through Caddo and Grady counties over the next 30 to 45 minutes, before reaching southeastern Canadian County at around 2:00pm CST (20:00UTC). By 2:14pm CST (20:14UTC), the line <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> hook echo, which was fully developed four minutes later. Observers reported wall clouds from the Yukon area into western portions of Oklahoma City during the next 10to 15minutes. At 2:36pm CST (20:37UTC), the supercell produced a tornado near the Wiley Post Airport in Oklahoma City, causing damage at the Northwest Expressway. According to the Doppler weather radar, the hook continued {{to show signs of}} rotation as it moved northeast across Oklahoma County. At 2:52pm CST (20:52UTC), the supercell produced its second tornado on the northwestern side of Edmond which caused its most severe damage near the Oklahoma and Logan County line. The tornado dissipated north of the Logan County Line at 3:05pm CST (21:05UTC).|$|E
