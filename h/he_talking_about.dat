David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard.

I had wanted to introduce karate-do to the heart of the nation for a long time, and had [the benefit of] the recommendation of the prefecture, etc., so, thinking that I shouldn’t miss this perfect opportunity, I had hurriedly prepared by hastily making double-width scrolls 6 containing more than a hundred pictures 7 of kata, along with explanations and whatnot.

40|$|Don’t {{let your}} left hand know what your right hand is doing’, Jesus said, in effect, ‘Let your piety be privately or {{modestly}} performed ’ (Matt. 6 : 3).

What was <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Visitors to the Wailing Wall (or Western Wall) in Jerusalem today will see the orthodox Jews at prayer wearing their phylacteries. Strapped to the left arm and to the forehead are leather boxes, each about two inches square. Inside them are parchment sheets bearing texts from the Law, including the passages which instruct the Israelites to write God’s commands on their foreheads and on their hearts (Ex. 13 : 9, 16; Dt. 6 : 8; 11 : 18). The phylacteries are put on for prayer, then taken off. They are very obvious. A number of phylacteries belonging to the Gospel period have been found near Qumran where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. They are tiny. The best preserved leather pouch is 0. 79 inch long, and 0. 51 inch wide. Inside it were four small pieces of thin leather bearing the sacred texts written in minute letters. Very thin leather thongs held these phylacteries in place. Once tied to the head or arm they would barely be visible and might be worn all day.
