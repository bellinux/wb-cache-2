500|$|Affleck {{reunited with}} {{director}} Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama Pearl Harbor (2001). He later characterized it {{as a film}} he did [...] "for money– for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale [...] "do what they can with their lines, and <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> the satiny shine of real movie stars". But Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn’t convince that he’d ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost {{the love of his}} life to his best friend". Affleck then parodied Good Will Hunting with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), made a cameo in the comedy Daddy and Them (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen The Third Wheel (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller The Sum of All Fears (2002). Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: [...] "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." [...] Affleck had an [...] "amazing experience" [...] making the thriller Changing Lanes (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of Variety described it as one of the actor's [...] "most thoroughly wrought" [...] performances: [...] "The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before." ...|$|E
500|$|He has two {{abilities}} {{that the original}} Spider-Man did not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, and a [...] "venom strike" [...] that can paralyze almost anyone with just a touch. The venom strike can be conducted through Miles' gloves, {{and can be used}} against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the Earth-616's Spider-Man. It can break chains being used to restrain Miles, and even repels non-ferrous objects, such as plastic Lego bricks. The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as Hank Pym's Giant Man. It is powerful enough to drive away the symbiotic villain Venom during Miles' first encounter with the creature, but by their second encounter, Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host. The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented, and is described by Bendis as being comparable to the feeling of being kicked in the testicles. Miles can effect a more powerful version of the strike, which he calls a [...] "mega venom blast". When Miles employs this ability, his eyes <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> yellow energy, which then explodes outwards in a radiant burst that can destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a [...] "recharging" [...] period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people.|$|E

500|$|The first {{portion of}} the film that {{establishes}} the characters of Betty, Rita and Adam presents {{some of the most}} logical filmmaking of Lynch's career. The later part of the film that represents reality to many viewers, however, exhibits a marked change in cinematic effect that gives it a quality just as surreal as the first part. Diane's scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment, which contrasts with the first {{portion of the}} film where [...] "even the plainest decor seems to sparkle", Betty and Rita <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> light and transitions between scenes are smooth. Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla's party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane's hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie's after Diane's suicide, or the [...] "repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured" [...] in the early portion of the film, creates the uncanny effect where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations. Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie's as [...] "extremely uncanny", because it is a scene where the [...] "boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate". Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of [...] "uncanny metaphors"; the doppelgänger of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object—primarily the blue box—that initiates Rita's disappearance and Diane's real life.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} is {{invisible to the}} human eye, but illuminating certain materials with UV radiation causes the emission of visible light, causing these substances to <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> various colors.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "the propulsive, at times {{borderline}} preposterous popcorn-thriller storylines; the slice-and-dice editing {{and the images}} that somehow managed to <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> grit; the fireball violence, often glimpsed in smeary-techno telephoto shots; {{the way he had}} of making actors seem volatile and dynamic and, at the same time, lacking almost any subtext" [...] were qualities of Scott's films that both [...] "excited audiences about his work" [...] and [...] "kept him locked outside the gates of critical respectability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another author explains, [...] "When Saint Jerome {{translated}} the Old Testament into Latin, he thought {{no one but}} Christ should <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> rays of light — so he advanced the secondary translation. However, writer J. Stephen Lang points out that Jerome's version actually described Moses as [...] "giving off hornlike rays," [...] and he [...] "rather clumsily translated it to mean 'having horns.'" [...] It has also been noted that he had Moses seated on a throne, yet Moses was never given {{the title of a}} King nor ever sat on such thrones.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{present in}} Dolichopteryx, Opisthoproctus, and Winteria species {{are a number}} of {{luminous}} organs; [...] Dolichopteryx has several along the length of its belly, and [...] Opisthoproctus has a single organ {{in the form of a}} rectal pouch. These organs <b>glow</b> <b>with</b> a weak light due to the presence of symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria, specifically, Photobacterium phosphoreum (family Vibrionaceae). The ventral surfaces of Opisthoproctus species are characterised by a flattened and projecting 'sole'; in the mirrorbelly (Opisthoproctus grimaldii) and Opisthoproctus soleatus, this sole may act as a reflector, by directing the emitted light downwards. The strains of P. phosphoreum present in the two Opisthoproctus species have been isolated and cultured in the lab. Through restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, the two strains have been shown to differ only slightly.|$|E
