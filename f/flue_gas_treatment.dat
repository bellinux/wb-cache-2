40|$|ABSTRACT Investigation of Microalgae Growth Kinetics using Coal-Fired Flue Gas as a Carbon Source Bryan Daniel Brooker Energy related {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} {{make up the}} majority of the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions must be alleviated to reduce the effects of global climate change. Microalgae cultivation sequesters CO 2 while producing biomass. Algal biomass can provide a renewable feedstock for biofuel and electricity production, and ingredients for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, pigments and cosmetics. Utilizing microalgae to mitigate CO 2 emissions encourages energy independence by providing a feedstock for biofuels and offers other potentially profitable avenues for the uses of biomass. This study focused on investigating the algal growth kinetics of microalgae cultivated with artificial coal-fired <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> Two algal strains, Chlorella vulgaris and Tetraselmis sp. were cultivated in lab scale photobioreactors to assess the feasibility of using <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> as a carbon source for microalgae growth. The microalgae growth kinetics were compared between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and pure CO 2 treatments for each algal strain.

40|$|Waste {{incineration}} {{is the art}} of completely combusting waste, {{while maintaining}} or reducing emission levels below current emission standards. Where possible, objectives include the recovering of energy as well as the  combustion residues.   Successful waste incineration makes it possible to achieve a deep reduction in waste volume, obtain a compact and sterile residue, and eliminate a wide array of pollutants. This book places waste incineration within the wider context of waste management, and demonstrates that, in contrast to landfills and composting, waste incineration can eliminate objectionable and hazardous properties such as flammability and toxicity, result in a significant reduction in volume, and destroy gaseous and liquid waste streams leaving little or no residues beyond those linked to <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> neutralization and <b>treatment.</b> Moreover, waste incineration sterilizes and destroys putrescible matter, and produces usable heat.   Incineration Technologies first appeared as a peer-reviewed contribution to  the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology.

The emission of PCDD/Fs by MSWIs is a controversial subject in human health risk assessment. In this study the effect of a MSWI on a residential area was assessed before and after the installation of an additional <b>treatment</b> system for <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> This additional <b>treatment</b> system resulted in a dramatic decrease in PCDD/F concentrations in stack <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> samples by 99. 98 %, while the concentrations in air decreased by approximately 50 % (36, 500 and 0. 75 pg I-TEQ m- 3 for air in 1999; 3. 5 and 0. 38 pg I-TEQ m- 3 in 2002; 1. 6 and 0. 076 pg I-TEQ m- 3 in 2005 for stack gas and air, respectively). Considering the congener distributions of PCDD/Fs between stack <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and air samples, the study area seemed to have been contaminated by other urban sources as well as the MSWI. ISC 3 model results support the conclusion that this incinerator became only a minor contributor to the study area after installation of the supplementary systems. This resulted from both proper MSWI operation using modern technology and additional sources of contaminants in this region. Finally, PCDD/F uptake by humans through inhalation of contaminated air was estimated. Assuming that inhalation exposure contributes 10 % of total exposure, total exposure was lower than WHO guidelines.

40|$|AbstractOxyfuel {{combustion}} {{technology is}} one of several Carbon Abatement Technologies (CATs) currently being developed. The technology offers a means of generating carbon dioxide rich <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> requiring minimal <b>treatment</b> prior to sequestration or beneficial application. The oxyfuel process is based on excluding the inert components (mainly nitrogen) of air from the combustion process. In oxyfuel combustion, nitrogen is largely absent from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> since the fuel is combusted with a mixture of nearly pure oxygen (∼ 95 % O 2 -separated from air in an air separation unit (ASU)) and CO 2 rich recycled <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> It is recognised as a leading Carbon Capture technology for new and retrofit power plant. Previous studies undertaken by Doosan Power Systems, Air Products, University of Edinburgh and others have shown that there is significant scope to optimise overall plant efficiency, both at the design stage and during normal operation. Therefore the current work seeks to realise these benefits through the adoption of optimised designs and the development of appropriate control and dynamic optimisation strategies. Recycling <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> in the Oxyfuel process gives rise to a number of operational and control features not seen in conventional air-fired power plant systems. Comprehensive dynamic models of the Oxyfuel process systems and associated controls are being developed as part of the TSB collaborative project “Optimisation of Oxyfuel PF Power Plant for Transient Behaviour” to study these aspects. The Oxyfuel specific models are coupled to a whole cycle, non-linear, dynamic model of the boiler and turbine systems allowing development of control schemes, which can meet the full range of operational requirements and capabilities of the Oxyfuel plant. Early results from the model suggest that operation in Oxyfuel mode may provide an opportunity to improve plant flexibility and both primary and secondary response, a capability which is of increasing importance as the mix of conventional, nuclear and renewable generation changes...|$|R
