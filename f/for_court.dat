5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec <b>for</b> <b>court</b> martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E

5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus.

It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{situation}} in Prussia was changing. Following the death of Frederick William III, the new regime of Frederick William IV was far more liberal. Spontini was dismissed, and the Berlin premiere of Les Huguenots was arranged (20 May 1842). On the instigation of Alexander von Humboldt, Meyerbeer was installed {{later in the year}} as Prussian Generalmusikedirektor and director of music for the Royal Court. Meyerbeer wrote a number of works <b>for</b> <b>court</b> occasions, and also provided music, at the King's request, for the first staging on Berlin in 1856 of his brother Michael's play Struensee (based on the life of Johann Friedrich Struensee), which had also been proscribed under the previous regime.|$|E

5|$|Nova Scotia's county {{municipalities}} {{originate from}} a historical system of 18 counties. Prior {{to the establishment}} of rural municipalities in 1879, local government was administered by appointed courts of sessions. On April 17, 1879, the original non-elected courts of sessions were abolished in favour of elected councils when The County Incorporation Act came into force. As a result, 12 county municipalities were established, while the remaining 6 counties, which were previously divided into districts <b>for</b> <b>court</b> sessional purposes, were established as district municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of elected rural local government in Nova Scotia, 6 of the 18 historical counties were divided into districts <b>for</b> <b>court</b> sessional purposes. On April 17, 1879, these 6 historical counties were established as 12 district municipalities, rather than county municipalities, based on their previous district divisions. The district municipalities provide local government to the residents of the 6 historical counties living outside of incorporated towns. Nova Scotia's 12 district municipalities continue administratively as district municipalities under the authority of the Municipal Government Act of 1998.|$|E

One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The front room upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E

Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 <b>for</b> <b>court</b> costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists <b>for</b> <b>court</b> masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, {{stating that the}} show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell’s Kitchen, in addition to sound stage work. Loeb said that Daredevil would begin filming in July 2014, and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month. It filmed under the working title Bluff, on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program. Production concluded on December 21, 2014. Other filming locations in New York City included: the Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Bushwick neighborhoods in Brooklyn; Abe Lebewohl Park in the East Village; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in Flushing, Queens; the New York State Supreme Court Building, with the interior <b>for</b> <b>court</b> scenes filmed on a set; Brooklyn Borough Hall; the Rockefeller Center rooftop gardens; Brooklyn College for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.|$|E

5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed <b>for</b> <b>court</b> performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{helped to}} deal with several {{diplomatic}} crises. The first of these involved the Hand of St James, the relic which Matilda had brought back with her from Germany many years before. Frederick I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered the hand {{to be part of}} the imperial regalia and requested that Henry return it to Germany. Matilda and Henry were equally insistent that it should remain at Reading Abbey, where it had become a popular attraction for visiting pilgrims. Frederick was bought off with an alternative set of expensive gifts from England, including a huge, luxurious tent, probably chosen by Matilda, which Frederick used <b>for</b> <b>court</b> events in Italy. She was also approached by Louis VII of France, in 1164, and helped to defuse a growing diplomatic row over the handling of Crusading funds.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} <b>for</b> <b>court,</b> attorney Phoenix Wright is attacked from behind, {{resulting in}} a severe case of amnesia. With {{the help of his}} client, policewoman Maggey Byrde, he learns that he is representing her in a case where she faces charges of having murdered her boyfriend, a fellow officer. After narrowly avoiding disaster due to his lack of preparation, Phoenix exposes Richard Wellington, a witness testifying for the prosecution, as the true murderer, saving Maggey. In the aftermath of the trial, he recalls another case that occurred two months prior: Dr. Turner Grey, a private surgeon who lost his reputation due to alleged malpractice, requested his help in contacting Maya Fey, his former secretary who had left the practice to finish training as a spirit medium in her home village. While performing a spirit channeling on Grey's behalf, Maya apparently kills him {{under the influence of the}} spirit's evil. Forced to once again defend her in court, Phoenix learns that Franziska von Karma, the daughter of his old enemy Manfred von Karma, has assumed the role of High Prosecutor from Miles Edgeworth, who is presumed dead. Teaming up with Maya and her young cousin Pearl, Phoenix uncovers a conspiracy between Mimi Miney, a disgruntled nurse who once worked at Grey's clinic, and Maya's aunt Morgan Fey to ruin Maya's chances of succeeding her mother as spiritual leader of her home village. When Miney publicly confesses to the murder, Morgan is sentenced to solitary confinement for her crimes and Phoenix decides to take Pearl in as one of his assistants. Six months later, the firm takes on another high-profile client: circus magician Maximillion Galactica, accused of murdering his employer Russell Berry in a dispute. Despite Franziska's interference, Phoenix and his team prove that Acro, one of Max's fellow performers, framed him after mistakenly killing Russell.|$|E
