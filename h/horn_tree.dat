50|$|Bison mate in {{late spring}} and summer in more open plain areas. During fall and winter, bison tend to gather in more wooded areas. During this time, bison partake in horning behaviors. They rub their <b>horns</b> against <b>trees,</b> young saplings, and even utility poles. Aromatic trees like cedars and pine seem to be preferred. Horning appears to be {{associated}} with insect defense, as it occurs most often in the fall when the insect population is at its highest. Cedar and pines emit an aroma after bison horn them and this seems {{to be used as a}} deterrent for insects.|$|R
5000|$|Vachellia cornigera, {{commonly}} known as Bullhorn Acacia (family Fabaceae), is a swollen-thorn tree native to Mexico and Central America. The common name of [...] "bullhorn" [...] refers to the enlarged, hollowed-out, swollen thorns (technically called stipular spines) that occur in pairs {{at the base of}} leaves, and resemble the horns of a steer. In Yucatán (one region where the bullhorn acacia thrives) it is called [...] "subín", in Panamá the locals call them [...] "cachito" [...] (little <b>horn).</b> The <b>tree</b> grows to a height of 10 m. The Vachellia cornigera is typically found in woodland and great plains.|$|R

Lluís Permanyer claims that [...] "the gallery at ground level is the façade's most outstanding feature, a daring combination of wrought iron and stone in which decorative historical elements such as a cypress, an olive <b>tree,</b> <b>horns</b> of plenty, and the Catalan coat of arms can be discerned".|$|R
40|$|Hornbills are {{important}} dispersers {{of a wide}} range of tree species. Many of these species bear fruits with large, lipid-rich seeds that could attract terrestrial rodents. Rodents have multiple effects on seed fates, many of which remain poorly understood in the Palaeotropics. The role of terrestrial rodents was investigated by tracking seed fate of five <b>horn</b> bill-dispersed <b>tree</b> species in a tropical forest in north-cast India. Seeds were marked inside and outside of exclosures below 6 - 12 parent fruiting trees (undispersed seed rain) and six hornbill nest trees (a post-dispersal site). Rodent visitors and seed removal ere monitored using camera traps. Our findings suggest that several rodent species. especially two species of porcupine were major on-site seed predators.

50|$|Rhinos use several {{forms of}} communication. Due to their solitary nature, scent marking {{is often used}} to {{identify}} themselves to other black rhinos. Urine spraying occurs on trees and bushes, around water holes and feeding areas. Females urine spray more often when receptive for breeding. Defecation sometimes occurs in the same spot used by different rhinos, such as around feeding stations and watering tracks. Coming upon these spots, rhinos will smell to see who is in the area and add their own marking. When presented with adult feces, male and female rhinoceroses respond differently than when they are presented with subadult feces. The urine and feces of one black rhinoceros helps other black rhinoceroses to determine its age, sex, and identity. Less commonly they will rub their heads or <b>horns</b> against <b>tree</b> trunks to scent-mark.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{a synagogue}} of the 5th or 6th century was {{uncovered}} {{in the coastal}} Ionian town of Saranda, Albania. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's <b>horn,</b> and lemon <b>tree.</b> Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a Torah, animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.|$|R

He no longer stole like a gray shadow from thicket to thicket as he had done when searching for the beautiful stranger with the dainty feet. He bounded along, careless of how much noise he made. From time to time he would stop to whistle a challenge and to clash his <b>horns</b> against the <b>trees</b> and stamp the ground with his feet.|$|R

Village public houses are the <b>Horn</b> Inn, Green <b>Tree</b> Inn and Crown Inn on High Street, and the Bird in the Barley on Northfield Road (A159).|$|R
50|$|The tree of {{a western}} saddle is the most {{critical}} component, defining {{the size and shape}} of the finished product.

Leather is stretched and molded around the tree, with minimal padding between the tree and the exterior leather, usually a bit of relatively thin padding on the seat, and a sheepskin cover on the underside of the skirts to prevent chafing and rubbing on the horse.|$|R
60|$|The drowsy {{afternoon}} wore on. Through {{the open}} windows came the sound of carriages driven along the dusty way, the shouts of the coachmen to their horses, the jingling of bells, the hooting of motor <b>horns.</b> A lime <b>tree,</b> whose leaves were stirred by the languorous breeze, kept tapping against the window. From a further distance came the faint, muffled voices of promenaders, and the echo of the guns from the Tir du Pigeons. But through it all, Selingman, {{lying on his back}} and snoring loudly, slept. He was awakened at last by the feeling that some one had entered the room. He sat up and blinked.|$|R

Among other things, the presentation advantage of the 3 -step program is that the non-trivial tricky points are distributed between the independent parts each of which we justify following its own intrinsic methodology (to say nothing of the induction used in the opposite directions) : (1) From LL to HLL - we use purely proof-theoretic arguments. (2) From HLL to Horn programs - we translate trees (HLL derivations) into another <b>trees</b> (<b>Horn</b> programs) of the same shape, almost. (3) From Horn programs to Minsky computations - we use purely computational arguments...|$|R
50|$|The first artist {{painted a}} single {{miniature}} on folio 1 recto, an illustration for the First Eclogue. In it a cowherd, Tityrus, plays a flute while sitting under a tree. The heads of three cows look {{out from behind}} the tree. Meanwhile a standing goatherd, Meliboeus, leads a goat by its <b>horns</b> under a <b>tree.</b> More goats look out from behind that tree. This miniature shows some remnants of classical style. The cows and goats looking {{out from behind the}} trees are an attempt, albeit an unsuccessful one, at creating the appearance of space. The garments of the two men are draped naturally and the heads are shown in three quarter view. The miniature, unlike any miniature in this manuscript, is unframed which shows a connection to the tradition of papyrus roll illustration.|$|R

40|$|Automatically verifying safety {{properties}} of programs is hard, {{and it is}} even harder if the program acts upon arrays {{or other forms of}} maps. Many approaches exist for verifying programs operating upon Boolean and integer values (e. g. abstract interpretation, counterexample-guided abstraction refinement using interpolants), but transposing them to array properties has been fraught with difficulties. In contrast to most preceding approaches, we do not introduce a new abstract domain or a new interpolation procedure for arrays. Instead, we generate an abstraction as a scalar problem and feed it to a preexisting solver, with tunable precision. Our transformed problem is expressed using Horn clauses, a common format with clear and unambiguous logical semantics for verification problems. An important characteristic of our encoding is that it creates a nonlinear <b>Horn</b> problem, with <b>tree</b> unfoldings, even though following "flatly" the control-graph structure ordinarily yields a linear Horn problem, with linear unfoldings. That is, our encoding cannot be expressed by an encoding into another control-flow graph problem, and truly leverages the capacity of the Horn clause format. We illustrate our approach with a completely automated proof of the functional correctness of selection sort...|$|R
40|$|From book jacket: In {{the humid}} forests of Cape <b>Horn,</b> a single <b>tree</b> can host more than 100 species of little {{epiphyte}} plants. The {{floor of the}} forest and the rocks are also covered by numerous species of liverworts, mosses, and lichens. The decision to stop at a tree or rock and explore these “miniature forests” generates an authentic ecotourism experience. In a small area we can spend several minutes or hours with a magnifying glass or camera discovering the colors, shapes, and textures of the most diverse organisms of Cape Horn. This guidebook enhances exploration by providing information to understand the architecture, life cycles, and identification of taxonomic groups of the organisms that form them. For example, when viewing a yellow orange organism, the full color pictures and text in the guidebook illustrate {{that what you are}} viewing on the inter-tidal rocks is a crustose lichen, with a well-defined circular structure belonging to the genus Caloplaca that enjoys a broad distribution in inter-tidal zones of Arctic and Antarctic areas. The authors of this guidebook also provide a novel twist on other, more traditional field guides to bryophytes and lichens by introducing the innovative, sustainable tourism activity of “ecotourism with a hand lens. ” They present a strong natural history narrative and an ecological and ethical orientation for the appreciation of wonders of the miniature forests of Cape Horn...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne view of {{computational}} {{learning theory}} {{is that of a}} learner acquiring the knowledge of a teacher. We introduce a formal model of learning capturing the idea that teachers may have gaps in their knowledge. In particular, we consider learning from a teacher who labels examples “+” (a positive instance of the concept being learned), “−” (a negative instance of the concept being learned), and “?” (an instance with unknown classification), {{in such a way that}} knowledge of the concept class and all the positive and negative examples is not sufficient to determine the labelling of any of the examples labelled with “?”. The goal of the learner is not to compensate for the ignorance of the teacher by attempting to infer “+” or “−” labels for the examples labelled with “?”, but is rather to learn (an approximation to) the ternary labelling presented by the teacher. Thus, the goal of the learner is still to acquire the knowledge of the teacher, but now the learner must also identify the gaps. This is the notion of learning from a consistently ignorant teacher. We present general results describing when known learning algorithms can be used to obtain algorithms that learn from a consistently ignorant teacher. We investigate the learnability of a variety of concept classes in this model, including monomials, monotone DNF formulas, <b>Horn</b> sentences, decision <b>trees,</b> DFAs, and axis-parallel boxes in Euclidean space, among others. Both learnability and non-learn- ability results are presented...|$|R

The paper discusses the complexity of this task, outlines several algorithms for computing both exact and approximate k-decompositions, and evaluates the potential of this approach empirically. Wefocus on the class of tree constraint networks and Horn theories and report results on arti cially generated relations and on three real life cases. Our experiments show that for uniform random relations, the quality of upper bound approximations improves as k increases. However, when we require very high accuracy, decomposition is not e ective since k grows linearly {{with the size of}} the data. When the data comes from a near-tractable source, the approach is useful. Experiments show that for the King Rook King problem the generalizing power of such methods is comparable to that of recently developed learning algorithms. ...|$|R

Evidently the herd had broken up here--I knew that from the spoor--and {{penetrated}} the opposite bush in little troops. I crossed the glade, and choosing one line of spoor, followed it for some sixty yards, {{when it became clear}} to me that I was surrounded by buffaloes; and yet so dense was the cover that I could not see any. A few yards to my left I could hear one rubbing its <b>horns</b> against a <b>tree,</b> while from my right came an occasional low and throaty grunt which told me that I was uncomfortably near an old bull. I crept on towards him with my heart in my mouth, as gently as though I were walking upon eggs for a bet, lifting every little bit of wood in my path, and placing it behind me lest it should crack and warn the game. After me in single file came my three retainers, and I don't know which of them looked the most frightened. Presently Gobo touched my leg; I glanced round, and saw him pointing slantwise towards the left. I lifted my head a little and peeped over a mass of creepers; beyond the creepers was a dense bush of sharp-pointed aloes, of that kind of which the leaves project laterally, {{and on the other side}} of the aloes, not fifteen paces from us, I made out the horns, neck, and the ridge of the back of a tremendous old bull. I took my eight-bore, and getting on to my knee prepared to shoot him through the neck, taking my chance of cutting his spine. I had already covered him as well as the aloe leaves would allow, when he gave a kind of sigh and lay down.|$|R
50|$|A demon named Durgasur {{performed}} severe penances {{to please}} Lord Brahma. Finally, Lord Brahma became pleased and he {{appeared before the}} meditating demon. He calls Durgasur's name. Awakening from his penances, Durgasur sees Lord Brahma standing in his front and he becomes elated to have his appearance. He pays his gratitude to the three-headed Lord. Brahma tells him that the time to demand his boon of his choice has arrived. Hearing this, Durgasur asks Lord Brahma {{to give him the}} boon that his death cannot be sealed by any man, demon or God. Hearing this, Lord Brahma grants the demon his desired boon that no masculine force shall overcome him. Hearing this, Durgasur becomes elated and he claims that he is invincible. Lord Brahma vanishes and leaves a bragging Durgasur, boasting about his boon. Meanwhile, Durgasur announces to his demon companions about his boon. Then, he decides to establish his dominance over the three worlds and that he thinks that no one can stop him. Later, the demon decides to attack Kailash in the absence of Lord Shiva. He fears about the dreadful outcome of him and his army. However his demon friend suggested to wait for some time before doing something. He predicts that Lord Shiva might be away from Kailash for a long time. That idea that Durgasur's friend gave him, gave Durgasur the confidence to ready his army. Durgasur thinks that when the day Lord Shiva is gone, he will establish his reign over Kailash. But when he returns, he will have to confront Durgasur. Saying so, Durgasur prepared his demon armies. Seeing this, his demon friend was annoyed at him and berates him for not waiting a certain time. Durgasur tells his friend that he has been given a boon that no one will kill him. His demon friend still demands him to wait for the appropriate time. Sage Narad, seeing all this has told Lord Vishnu that Durgasur has readied his army and planned to attack the three worlds and gain victory there. Lord Vishnu enlightens Narad about Durgasur's boon that his boon will not give him any form of protection from getting killed by a woman. Narad became overjoyed and went to Durgasur. Durgasur enquired about his arrival. Narad requested the demon not to attack the Gods as they will kill him. Durgasur, who was intent to attack, told Narad that he will not attack the Gods as he is afraid of death and asked him to tell the Gods that he will not attack the Gods. Narad became elated with joy and vanished. But what sage Narad didn't know, he fell into Durgasur's trap. First Durgasur started tormenting the inhabitants of Earth. Then, led by Durgasur, the demons defeated the Gods in a severe battle. He, {{with the help of his}} fellow demons, conquered the three worlds. He dominated the heaven, Earth and other worlds in his control. He also destroyed several residential schools. He compelled the wives of the sages to sing his praise, and sent the gods from heaven to dwell in the forests, and by a mere nod summoned them to reverence him. He abolished religious ceremonies; sages through fear of him gave up the reading of the Vedas; rivers changed their course; fire lost its energy, and the terrified stars retired from sight. He assumed the shape of the clouds, and gave rain whenever he pleased; the earth, through fear, yielded an abundant harvest, and the trees flowered and gave fruit out of the proper season. In Kailash, Parvati meditates upon the coming scenes and promises Lord Shiva that she will perform her duties for the deliverance of the world. At that time, the Gods approach her and inform that Durgasur had defeated them and captured the three worlds and request her for her protection. All the Gods, desperate for their Mother's protection, continually requested her to protect them.Parvati heeded to their request and that she will definitely stop Durgasur. The Gods were elated. Later, Nandi, Ganesh and Kartikeya observe a stern Parvati. At Durgasur's kingdom, his demon deputies praise him. Durgasur enlightens his demons about various topics and he advises his armies that they must attack Kailash, in the absence of Lord Shiva and gain supremacy and victory there. Back at Kailash, Parvati tells her sons and her servant Nandi that Durgasur has planned to attack Kailash. On hearing this, Kartikeya requested for orders to stop Durgasur and protect Kailash, but Parvati stops her older valiant warrior son, as she is the Mistress of Kailash. When someone comes to Kailash with the intent to harm it, she will definitely destroy him. She also says that Durgasur has planned to attack her abode. Ganesh, her second young son asked if his father, Lord Shiva would return to Kailash to kill Durgasur. Parvati said to her younger son that she is the only one who can put an end to his existence. She decides to send a peace messenger to Durgasur, with a last chance to surrender, as it's his final gift. Saying so, she caused Kaalratri or Kali, the Goddess of the death and night to appear. A dark female whose beauty bewitched the inhabitants of the three worlds. Kaalratri asked Parvati for her orders. So Parvati requested Kaalratri to act as her messenger and go to Durgasur and order him to restore things to their appropriate order. At Durgasur's kingdom, Kaalratri arrived there, as an attractive damsel wearing black apparels, making her appearance terrifying to all the demons present there, but not to Durgasur. One demon enquired about her arrival. Kaalratri quickly interrupts him and introduces herself as the messenger of Goddess Parvati. Durgasur talks back to the female messenger, and pretends to surrender to her, which annoyed Kaalratri. She threatens to burn him and his dungeon into ashes. Kaalratri tries to make Durgasur surrender to Parvati, but Durgasur wanted the female messenger to come close to her, but she resists by saying that he has called his end towards him. Hearing this, Durgasur becomes annoyed and ordered his deputies to hold the messenger in custody. Kaalratri says that holding a messenger in contempt is against the rules of war. But Durgasur still talks back to her and again ordered his demons to capture her. This time, Kaalratri expanded her size, with flames emanating from her body. Durgasur and his demon forces were terrified on seeing the huge form of Kaalratri. Kaalratri gave out a loud bloodcurdling roar, resulting in the destruction of Durgasur's soldiers who were sent to catch her. Seeing this, Durgasur became furious and he sent out 30,000 demons who were such monsters in size that they covered the surface of the earth. At the sight of these demons, Kaalratri fled to Parvati, followed by the demons. Durgasur, with innumerable demon soldiers, went to fight Parvati, at the Vindhyachal Mountain.Kaalratri or Kali returned to Parvati and conveyed Durgasur's reply to her. Parvati, on hearing this tells her that if Durgasur wants war, it's war he'll get. At the Vindhya mountains, Durgasur and his huge demon armies set out to attack Kailash. At that time, Lord Brahma, Goddess Saraswati, Lord Vishnu, Goddess Lakshmi, Narad and the Gods all appeared to witness the end of Durgasur. At that time, Parvati arrives there in an intense form, with eighteen arms sprouting from her back, holding all the deadly weapons of the Gods and seated on a lion/tiger. Her terrifying appearance frightened Durgasur and his huge demon army. Parvati was intent on killing Durgasur. Durgasur challenged Parvati for a battle. The eighteen-armed Parvati accepted his challenge and so, a fierce battle took place between the Goddess and the demons.The troops of the demon poured their arrows on Parvati as she sat on the mountain Vindhya, thick as the drops of rain in a storm; they even tore up trees, mountains, etc. and hurled them at her; in return she threw a weapon which carried away the arms of many of the demons. Durgasur himself then hurled a flaming dart at the goddess, which she turned aside; another being sent, she stopped it by a hundred arrows. He next aimed an arrow at Parvati's breast; this too she repelled, and two other weapons, a club and a pike. At last coming to close quarters, Parvati seized Durgasur and set her left foot on his breast, but he, managing to disengage himself, renewed the fight. At this moment, came, out of the body of the Goddess, all the innumerable Shaktis, all armed, came out of the Devi successively. The demons were even more terrified by seeing all the Shaktis acting as the helpers of Parvati. The Shaktis fought with the demons and succeed in destroying all of Durgasur's armies. Durgasur became furious after he saw that his armies were destroyed. He was the lone demon left in the battlefield. The eighteen-armed Parvati was left to kill the lone demon King, for the betterment of the world. Durgasur sent a dreadful shower of hail, the effect of which Parvati counteracted by an instrument called Sosuna. The demon now assumed the shape of an elephant as large as a mountain, and approached the goddess; but she tied his legs, and, with her nails, which were like scimitars, tore him to pieces. He rose again in the form of a buffalo, and with his <b>horns</b> cast stones, <b>trees,</b> and mountains, tearing up the trees by the breath of his nostrils. Parvati then pierced him with her trident; he reeled to and fro, and, renouncing the form of a buffalo, assumed his original body as a monster, with a thousand arms, having a weapon in each. Approaching Parvati, she destroyed his thousand arms, and carried him into the air, whence she threw him to the ground with fearful force. The fall had not destroyed him. Durgasur hurled his lethal weapons at Parvati as she hurled her deadly weapons at him. But all the demon's weapons were rendered futile by the Goddess's weapons. Durgasur again became furious when the eighteen-armed Parvati was dominating the battle. He ran towards her but he fell. Parvati, deciding to end the duel, hurled her trident at the defeated demon. Seeing the trident coming towards him, he was scared. Then, Parvati's trident pierced Durgasur in his chest. He instantly fell dead. Parvati succeeds in killing Durgasur. Seeing the end of demon Durgasur, the Gods glorified the eighteen-armed Goddess for killing Durgasur. Lord Brahma, Vishnu, Goddess Lakshmi, Saraswati and Narad also praised her. After giving the eighteen-armed Parvati great praise, Parvati returned to her normal form. The Gods paid their gratitude to her for killing Durgasur and for liberating the three worlds from his bondage. Eventually, everything was restored to its proper order. Lord Brahma and Vishnu, with their respective wives and sage Narad, praised Parvati as Durgasur Sangharini. Since Parvati killed Durgasur, she was given the name Durga.|$|R
