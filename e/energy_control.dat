The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Control</b> Board.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, major {{questions}} arose {{regarding the}} status of Ontario's nuclear plants. The oldest of these plants built in the 1970s were aging {{and in the early}} 1990s reliability began to decline significantly. The situation drew the attention of the federal nuclear regulator, the Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Control</b> Board of Canada (AECB) (now Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission), and was acknowledged by Ontario Hydro. In 1996, the AECB judged the situation at Pickering A to be particularly critical and issued the plant a six-month operating license. The following year a review board of industry experts concluded that the operations of Ontario's nuclear plants were [...] "below standard" [...] and [...] "minimally acceptable". The Ontario government responded by approving a Nuclear Asset Optimization Plan proposed by Ontario Hydro. The plan had three major objectives: 1) the closure of the seven oldest of the utility's 19 operational nuclear reactors for rehabilitation; 2) the redeployment of staff; and 3) the spending of between $5 and $8 billion to implement the plan. In order to replace the lost capacity by the reactor closures, Ontario Hydro relied on its five coal-fired generation facilities. The result was a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions, smog, and acid rain precursors from these facilities between 1997 and 2001. This development occurred at a time when poor air quality was already a growing public health concern in southern Ontario. In response to the concerns of the public health impacts of increased coal-fired generation, all three major provincial political parties included a coal-phase out plan in their 2003 election platforms. The winner of the election, the Ontario Liberal Party, led by Dalton McGuinty, had committed to a phase-out by 2007.|$|E

40|$|With {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of overweight and obese {{people in the}} United States, understanding the endogenous systems that <b>control</b> <b>energy</b> balance is of clinical significance. Given that obesity is driven, in part, by excessive intake of calories, {{it is critical to}} understand how food intake is controlled, with the goal of improving pharmacotherapies to treat obesity. A variety of peripherally and centrally-derived neuroendocrine signals are released following ingestion and act in distributed nuclei throughout the brain to <b>control</b> <b>energy</b> balance. The contribution of particular nuclei and the specific cell types within those nuclei that impact <b>energy</b> balance <b>control</b> requires further investigation. This dissertation focuses on novel mechanisms of two anorexogenic hormones, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and amylin, for <b>energy</b> balance <b>control.</b> Given that glutamatergic signaling mediates the intake suppressive effects of GLP- 1 and that astrocytes are key modulators of synaptic glutamate levels, I hypothesize that GLP- 1 receptors (GLP- 1 R) are expressed on astrocytes within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a feeding relevant nucleus, and contribute to <b>energy</b> balance <b>control.</b> Furthermore, neurons within the NTS produce GLP- 1 and project widely throughout the brain. Given that the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), an understudied region in <b>energy</b> balance <b>control,</b> receives projections from the NTS and expresses the GLP- 1 R, I hypothesize that GLP- 1 R signaling in the LDTg regulates <b>energy</b> balance <b>control.</b> Traditionally believed to act in the area postrema, the hormone amylin has recently been shown to act in mesolimbic regions to <b>control</b> <b>energy</b> balance, findings that have broadened the perspectives of CNS amylin action. Given that the LDTg binds amylin and receives and send projections to mesolimbic sites, I hypothesized that the amylin receptor signaling in the LDTg modulates energy balance. Collectively, the data presented in this dissertation broaden our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS) action of neuroendocrine signals for <b>energy</b> balance <b>control,</b> in terms of both cell- and nuclei-specificity, providing greater insight into potential targets for the developing improved pharmacotherapies to treat obesity. ...|$|R
