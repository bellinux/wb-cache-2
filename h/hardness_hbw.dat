40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the production by pressure infiltration (squeeze casting) of metal matrix composite materialsbased on pure Cu-ETP copper containing δ-alumina SAFFIL fibres The microstructure of composite specimens and morphology wasexamined using SEM and optical microscopy. Physical properties: Brinell <b>hardness</b> <b>HBW</b> and density were characterized. Preforms with 10, 15 and 20 vol. % of fibres were preheated and infiltrated applying the infiltration pressure of 100 MPa. The strengthening of matrix with SAFFIL fibres resulted in significant increase of hardness. Metallographic examinations showed, that SAFFIL fibres are not destroyed in course of the infiltration process and are uniformly distributed in copper matrix. SEM observations confirm the poorwettability of fibres by liquid Cu-ETP. The wear of manufactured MMCs during dry sliding against cast iron applying a pin-on-disc testerwere recorded after 1, 3. 5 and 8. 5 km of friction distance. Increasing content of SAFFIL fibres in the copper matrix results in the significant decreasing of wear...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work copper was strenghtened with 20 and 30 vol. % of alumina {{particles}} characterized by diameter of 3 - 6 μm. The copperbased composite materials were manufactured by the squeeze casting method. Preheated preforms made from Al 2 O 3 particles were placedin the desired {{place in the}} heated cast die and the squeeze casting process with liquid copper was performed applying the infiltrationpressure of 90 MPa and pressure was kept for 10 - 15 s until solidification was complete. The microstructure and physical properties: Brinell <b>hardness</b> (<b>HBW)</b> and density were characterized. Metallografic examinations showed that alumina particles were uniformly distributed in the copper matrix. Hardness of 208 HBW for composite materials containing 30 vol. % of particles was achieved. Wear investigations were performed applying the tribological pin-on-disc tester. Friction forces between copper based composite materials containing 20 and 30 vol. % of Al 2 O 3 particles and cast iron were registered and wear was determined {{on the base of}} the specimen mass loss after 1. 0, 3. 5 and 8. 5 km friction distance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the INCONEL® 625 (IN 625) alloy processed by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), showing the effect of different process parameters on the final density of the samples and analyzing the effects of different heat treatments on the microstructure and hardness. The results showed that there is a wide process parameter window for obtaining dense samples (with low porosity, < 0. 25 %) with a fine cellular dendritic microstructure. IN 625 processed by DMLS showed higher mechanical properties with respect to the same alloy after casting. Moreover, after aging treatments, carried out between 700 °C and 800 °C for 24 hours, the Brinell <b>hardness</b> (<b>HBW)</b> increased about 30 % due to the precipitation of different phases. The FESEM analysis on heat-treated IN 625 confirmed the presence of different precipitates such as gamma double prime (γ") phase, delta (δ) phase and other nanometric-sized phases. IN 625 is generally used in applications that require high corrosion resistance from ambient to high temperature (up to 1000 °C). Therefore, the current research on heat-treated IN 625 processed by DMLS could be useful for building components with high mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance in harsh environment...|$|E
50|$|While in the {{traditional}} static tests the test force is applied uniformly with increasing magnitude, dynamic testing methods apply an instantaneous load. A test takes a mere 2 seconds and, using the standard probe D, leaves an indentation of just ~0.5 mm in diameter on steel or steel casting with a Leeb hardness of 600 HLD. By comparison, a Brinell indentation on the same material is ~3 mm (<b>hardness</b> value ~400 <b>HBW</b> 10/3000), with a standard-compliant measuring time of ~15 seconds plus the time for measuring the indentation.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} soaking parameters (temperature and time) on structure and mechanical properties of spheroidal graphite nickel-manganese-copper cast iron, containing: 7. 2 % Ni, 2. 6 % Mn and 2. 4 % Cu. Raw castings showed austenitic structure and relatively low <b>hardness</b> (150 <b>HBW)</b> guaranteeing their good machinability. Heat treatment consisted in soaking the castings within 400 to 600 °C for 2 to 10 hours followed by air-cooling. In most cases, soaking caused changes in structure and, in consequence, {{an increase of}} hardness in comparison to raw castings. The highest hardness and tensile strength was obtained after soaking at 550 °C for 6 hours. At the same time, decrease of the parameters related to plasticity of cast iron (elongation and impact strength) was observed. This resulted from the fact that, in these conditions, the largest fraction of fine-acicular ferrite with relatively high hardness (490 HV 0. 1) {{was created in the}} matrix. At lower temperatures and after shorter soaking times, hardness and tensile strength were lower because of smaller degree of austenite transformation. At higher temperatures and after longer soaking times, fine-dispersive ferrite was produced. That resulted in slightly lower material hardness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was presentation of the Continuous Cooling Transformations (CCT) diagrams and mechanical properties of two new bainite rail steels with working names RB 370 and RB 390. Design/methodology/approach: The CCT duiagrams was prepared by dilatometric method. The mechanical properities (Rp 0, 2, Rm, A, Z, KV, KU 2, KIc and KIc – 20) was searched according to European Standards. Findings: It was found, that on the whole cross – section of rails (S 49 or UIC 60) made of this new steels only bainite (mainly low bainite) will be formed. Practical implications: Very high mechanical properties of new grades encouraged to implement the first one (nickel – free with <b>hardness</b> of 370 <b>HBW)</b> on commercial scale. Rails (S 49) made of it are successfully operating as part of main exit track from ArcelorMittal Steel Plant of Poland in Dąbrowa Górnicza since 2004 year. Originality/value: Orginal value of the paper is to give an information, that it is possibility to procedure bainite rails S 49 or UIC 60 types of a very high mechanical properties, directly in rolling mill...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of changes the {{parameters}} of heat treatment on the structure {{and the degree of}} elements segregation was determined, in the context of corrosion resistance of ductile iron Ni-Mn-Cu, containing 7. 2 % Ni, 2. 6 % Mn and 2. 4 % Cu. In the condition after casting, castings of austenitic matrix and 160 <b>HBW</b> <b>hardness</b> were obtained. The achieved castings were soaked at 450, 550 and 650 °C for 4, 8 and 12 hours, then cooled down at the ambient air. In most cases, the heat treatment resulted in a change in the castings matrix, had the consequence of increasing their hardness in comparison to raw castings. Increasing the temperature and prolonging soaking time resulted in increasing the degree of transformation of austenite, while reducing the degree of elements segregation. This {{led to the formation of}} slightly bigger number of pitting due to corrosion, but not so deep and more evenly distributed in comparison to raw castings. Wherein the results of corrosion tests show that heat treatment of castings did not significantly change their corrosion resistance in comparison to raw castings, in contrast to the significant increase in mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{influence}} of heat treatment on microstructure and properties of sample cast assigned as a material used for frogs in railway crossover. Materials used in railway industry for frogs (manganese cast steel and forged pearlitic steel) do not fulfil strict conditions of exploitation of railway. One of the solutions is using cast steel with bainitic or bainite-martensite microstructure, what allows to gain high resistance properties (Rm = 1400 MPa, Rp 0, 2 = 900 MPa, <b>hardness</b> to 400 <b>HBW).</b> The cooling rates of rail type UIC 60 {{shows that it}} is possible to reach the bainitic microstructure in cast of frog. The microstructure of lower banite should have an advantageous influence on cracking resistance. In order to set the parameters of heat treatment, the critical temperatures were determined by dilatometric methods determined. This heat treatment consisted of normalizing that prepared it to the farther process of resistance welding. Moreover, the CCT diagram of proposed bainitic cast steel was prepared. The exams were done that can be used to evaluate the influence of heat treatment on microstructure and properties of the sample cast...|$|R
