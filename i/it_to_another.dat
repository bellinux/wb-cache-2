Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> part of the park.|$|E

5|$|The San Francisco Citizens' Committee {{wished to}} issue a {{commemorative}} coin as a fundraiser for {{a celebration of the}} statehood diamond jubilee. A California congressman attached authorization for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> coinage bill, which was approved by Congress in early 1925. Designs by sculptor Jo Mora met a hostile reception at the Commission of Fine Arts, but the Citizens' Committee would not change them, and they were approved. The coin has been widely praised for its beauty in the years since.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} the Arnou-le-Faucon lawsuit, Carrouges was once again in court facing Count Pierre, this time in dispute over the lands {{administered}} by his recently deceased father. Carrouges III's death early in 1382 vacated the captaincy of the castle of Bellême, a post Carrouges IV believed would be his by right. However, due to the failed lawsuit two years earlier, Count Pierre passed Carrouges over for the captaincy and gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> of his followers. The infuriated Carrouges again brought legal action against his overlord and again he was defeated in court. The only lasting result of the action was the further separation of Carrouges and Count Pierre's court.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|William Trotter Porter (December 24, 1809– July 19, 1858) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor who founded an early American newspaper devoted to sports. After {{working at a}} number of small newspapers, Porter moved to New York City in the 1830s. After employment at a newspaper in the city, he founded the Spirit of the Times, a newspaper modeled on a London paper called Bell's Life in London. The Spirit, which went through a number of names and incarnations over the years, was devoted to sports and other recreational pursuits. One of Porter's main interests involved horse racing, and he was involved in attempts to create the first stud book in the United States, which did not bear fruit. He was also instrumental in the development of American literature, as the Spirit published a number of short stories by American tall tale writers, and Porter edited two collections of short stories by American writers. After publishing the Spirit through the 1830s, he sold <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> printer but continued as the editor into the 1850s. He left the original Spirit in 1855 and in 1856 was hired as editor for another sporting newspaper, Porter's Spirit of the Times, published by George Wilkes. Porter died in 1858.|$|E

They were permanent and even transferable; the holder of a writ could assign <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> Any place could be searched at {{the whim of}} the holder, and searchers were not responsible for any damage they caused.

In this case, the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus {{have to be taken}} into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons within a nucleus.|$|E

25|$|It {{was to be}} a full {{generation}} before British archaeology {{caught up}} with the Danish.

Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.|$|E
