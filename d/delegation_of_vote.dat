40|$|This paper {{presents}} some proposals of protocols for {{two types}} of schemes such as verifiable <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> computation and remote electronic voting, based on polynomial properties. Our protocols for verifiable <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> computation are aimed to the efficient evaluation of polynomials, working on schemes where the polynomial and/or the input are kept secret to the server. Our proposal for remote electronic voting allows the verification <b>of</b> <b>vote</b> well-formation upon reception at the voting server, with little overhead of computations for the voter. ...|$|R

The EUJS delegates were {{present at the}} Youth Summit, the NGO Forum and the Governmental Conference. As the EUJS delegation arrived, they realized to what extent their role as young Jews would counterbalance the accusations imposed on the Jewish people.The event—in addition to spurring EUJS delegates to action on site—led to EUJS signing a common declaration with the Roma student delegation, setting forth {{the possibility of a}} partnership to promote Holocaust education, and subsequently resulting in an EUJS-led seminar in Budapest in November 2003.During the Youth Summit at Durban, EUJS, together with WUJS and SAUJS put forward a proposal calling for an end of the violence {{on both sides of the}} Middle East conflict.The proposal condemned the use of violence and called for students to take an active role in advocating peace in the region. A group led by a <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> Palestinians students <b>voted</b> down this proposal.During the governmental conference, EUJS met with political leaders such as Louis Michel, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Walter Schwimmer, the SecretaryGeneral of the Council of Europe.|$|R

40|$|Common {{interest}} {{communities have}} become the property form of choice for many Americans. As of 2010, sixty-two million Americans lived in common interest communities. Residents benefit from sharing the cost of common amenities – pools, lawns, gazebos – and from rules that ensure compliance with community expectations. But decisionmaking in common interest communities raises serious concerns about minority abuse and manipulation, a problem well known to all property law students. Decisions about which amenities will be provided and which rules will be enacted are typically made through some combination <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and <b>voting.</b> Delegates often act for their own benefit, and, for a variety <b>of</b> reasons, <b>voting</b> fails to capture the preferences of the community. This Article suggests a better way. Building upon the pioneering work of Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves, we propose a novel auction system that captures the intensity of resident preferences while preserving the honesty of declared preferences. The use of auction theory induces truthful revelation of preferences by participants and reflects the intensity of preference for any given policy outcome. As a result, our system allows communities to make better decisions and makes common interest communities more responsive {{to the needs of}} residents...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe main aim {{of access}} control models {{is to provide}} means to simplify the {{management}} of the security policy, which is a fastidious and error-prone task. Supporting delegation is considered as an important mean to decentralize the administration and therefore to allow security policy to be more flexible and easier to manipulate. Our main contribution is the proposition of a unified model to the administration and <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> obligations. Managing such delegations implies more requirements than managing traditional privileges delegation. In fact, the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> obligations may include two interpretations: the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> the obligation and the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> the responsibility related to this obligation. Moreover, since delegating an obligation involves the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> sanctions, then the consent of the user who receives this delegation may be required in some cases. We address in this paper these requirements and we propose a formalism to deal with them...|$|R
