50|$|Two {{years after}} Palevsky joined Northrop, the {{division}} {{was sold to}} Bendix Corporation. Palevsky worked at Bendix from 1952 to 1956 designing <b>digital</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzers</b> as a project engineer, working on the logic design for the company's first computer. In March 1956, Bendix offered their first digital computer, the Bendix G-15, described by some as the first personal computer (a claim that is widely disputed). Palevsky worked on the DA-1 <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> option, which connected to the G-15 and resulted in a machine similar to the MADDIDA, using the G-15 to re-wire the inputs to the analyzer instead of the custom drums and wiring of the earlier machine.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|R
50|$|While {{developing}} the MADIDDA, the design team {{came to realize}} that a <b>digital</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> could be run on a general-purpose digital computer through the use of an appropriate problem-oriented language (POL), such as Dynamo. A year after the first MADIDDA was demonstrated, Steele and the MADDIDA design team left Northrop, along with Irving S. Reed, in order to develop general-purpose computers. On July 16, 1950 they formed the Computer Research Corporation (CRC), which in 1953 was sold to NCR.|$|E

Invented by Floyd Steele, MADIDDA was developed at Northrop Aircraft Corporation between 1946-49 {{to be used as}} a guidance system for the Snark missile. No guidance system, however, resulted from the work on the MADDIDA, and rather it was used for aeronautical research [...] In 1952, the MADDIDA became the world's top-selling commercial digital computer (albeit a special-purpose machine), six units having been sold.
