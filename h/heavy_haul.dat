5000|$|Reward Challenge: For five minutes, contestants would bite off chunks {{from a large}} hanging {{piece of}} meat {{and put them on}} their plates using only their mouths while their hands are bound at their backs. There would be two rounds. The first round would involve the castaways and their {{respective}} loved ones as teams. The four teams that gathered the <b>heaviest</b> <b>haul</b> of meat would move on to the second round, where only the loved ones would compete. The loved one who had the <b>heaviest</b> <b>haul</b> of meat on their plate would win the reward for their partner castaway.|$|R

25|$|Carlisle {{also became}} a major railway centre with at one time 7 {{different}} companies using Carlisle Citadel railway station. Prior to {{the building of the}} Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway marshaling yard in Europe at Kingmoor which, although reduced in size, is still very much operational and used by railfreight companies like Colas Rail Freight, Freightliner <b>Heavy</b> <b>Haul,</b> DB Schenker Rail UK (formerly EWS) and very occasionally Direct Rail Services.|$|E
25|$|The ES44C4 (Evolution Series, 4400 HP, C-C wheel arrangement, 4 {{traction}} motors) {{was introduced}} in 2009. While similar to the ES44AC, the ES44C4 has two traction motors per truck, instead of the conventional three such as on the ES44AC. The center axle of each truck is unpowered, giving an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. BNSF Railway is the launch customer for this model, ordering an initial batch of 25 units numbered 6600-6624. As of 2015, BNSF Railway currently rosters over 900 ES44C4 units. On January 30, 2014 Florida East Coast Railway announced that they would buy 24 ES44C4's, to be numbered 800-823, for <b>heavy</b> <b>haul</b> service and intermodal traffic. All were delivered {{by the end of}} 2014, in order to beat the EPA's deadline on exhaust-emissions standards for new-built Tier 3 locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Many <b>heavy</b> <b>haul</b> coal {{lines were}} built in the late 20th century from the ports of Gladstone (beginning in 1968) and Hay Point (beginning in 1971). [...] Electrification of some of the <b>heavy</b> <b>haul</b> coal lines {{commenced}} in 1986. Finally an electrified rail system was developed in suburban Brisbane from 1979. Eventually the North Coast line between Brisbane and Rockhampton was electrified. This, together with the central Queensland mining railway, constitutes Australia's only significant rural rail electrification.|$|E

50|$|On August 17, 2010 TransForce {{acquired}} an equity interest in Calgary's EnQuest Energy Services and its subsidiaries, including Speedy <b>Heavy</b> <b>Hauling.</b> TransForce's U.S. subsidiary, Hemphill Trucking, will pay US$32 {{million for the}} assets, which will be merged with Hemphill under the new name of Hemphill-Speedy, headquartered in Grand Junction, Colo.

Special features include a pulse filtration system, movable sand plows, EM2000 control system and FIRE display system.|$|E

We were promised a <b>heavy</b> <b>haul</b> by the citizens, who, however, contented themselves with picking up the washed-out specimens found everywhere on the shore: unfortunately we had no time to superintend the work. A caseful was submitted to the British Museum, and a few proved interesting on account of their locality. The list printed {{at the end of this}} chapter was kindly supplied to me by Mr. Edgar A. Smith, superintendent of the Conchological Department.|$|E

Upon completion, the railway line was the <b>heaviest</b> <b>haul</b> railway in the world, designed for 40 tonnes axleloads, 2.5 to 5 tonnes heavier than the other Pilbara iron ore rail systems. On 4 November 2014, FMG Rail commenced trialing 42 tonnes axle loads.|$|R
25|$|Road steam {{disappeared}} through {{restrictions and}} charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over horse power for <b>heavy</b> <b>hauling</b> and short journeys. However, petrol lorries {{were starting to}} show better efficiency and could be purchased cheaply as war surplus; on a busy route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about £100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits, and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs.|$|R

25|$|The 9F {{turned out}} to be the best of the Standard classes, and one of the finest steam {{locomotives}} ever designed in Britain in terms of its capacity to <b>haul</b> <b>heavy</b> loads over long distances. It was highly effective at its designed purpose, <b>hauling</b> <b>heavy,</b> fast freight trains, and was used all over the British railway network. This was exemplified when in September 1982, preserved engine 92203 Black Prince set the record for the <b>heaviest</b> train ever <b>hauled</b> by a steam locomotive in Britain, when it started a 2,178-ton train at a Foster Yeoman quarry in Somerset, UK.|$|R
