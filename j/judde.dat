5|$|The Judd School (often known {{simply as}} Judd) is a grammar school in Tonbridge, Kent, {{southeast}} England. It was established in 1888 at Stafford House on East Street in Tonbridge, where it remained for eight years before moving to its present location on Brook Street, {{in the south of}} the town. Founded by the Skinners Company, it was named after 16th century merchant Sir Andrew <b>Judde,</b> whose endowment helped fund the school. The Skinners' Company maintains close links with the school and makes up the majority of the governing body.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Richard II, the priory was granted a licence in {{mortmain}} to hold lands valued at 26s 8d which returned 60s 8d annually. In 1523, the priory was proposed by Cardinal Wolsey to be dissolved as one of 40 priories and monasteries sold to provide fund {{for the establishment of}} Christ Church, Oxford. At that time, the priory was assessed as being worth £48 13s 4d. The dissolution happened on 8 February 1525. Wolsey was to provide a free grammar school for 40 pupils in exchange for the closure of the priory. The townsfolk of Tonbridge were against this plan, wanting to retain the priory. At a meeting in Maidstone, held in June 1525, only 16 people attended, of whom 13 were in favour of keeping the priory. The issue was still undecided at Wolsey's death in 1530. The priory then passed to the Crown and was granted to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor. It was not until 1553 that Andrew <b>Judde</b> established Tonbridge Free Grammar School.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} hundred years few {{details of the}} school survive apart from rare records in the Skinners' Company books. Headmaster Proctor died in 1558, and was succeeded {{by a series of}} headmasters, usually clergymen and always {{classical}} scholars. They included the Revd. William Hatch (1587-1615), the first Old Tonbridgian Headmaster. According to the Skinners' records, the Revd. Michael Jenkins (1615-24) was appointed because 'he {{was the only one who}} turned up'. During his time as Headmaster, the school received a series of generous endowments from Thomas Smythe, the first Governor of the East India Company and son of Andrew <b>Judde's</b> daughter Alice.|$|R

He accepted this obscure office, and from 1704 to 1721 he served as teacher of the third probation at Rouen, and then rector of the Paris novitiate. His lessons were so admired that his students would copy them to preserve their memories in writing. Many of these copies can still be found today.

5000|$|The second {{surviving}} son of Thomas [...] "Customer" [...] Smythe of Westenhanger Castle in Kent, by {{his wife}} Alice, daughter of Sir Andrew <b>Judde.</b> His grandfather, John Smythe of Corsham, Wiltshire, was described as yeoman, haberdasher and clothier, and was High Sheriff of Essex for the year of 1532. His father was also a haberdasher, and was ‘customer’ of the port of London. He purchased Westenhanger from Sir Thomas Sackville, and other property from Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Thomas Smythe's elder son, Sir John Smythe or Smith (1556?-1608) of Westenhanger, was High Sheriff of Kent in 1600, and father of Thomas Smythe, 1st Viscount Strangford.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, in 1604, Smythe was {{appointed}} {{one of the}} receivers for the Duchy of Cornwall, and, in June, was named special ambassador to the Russian Tsar Boris Godunov. Like Smythe's grandfather, Sir Andrew <b>Judde,</b> Lord Mayor of London (1550) {{and one of the}} founders of the Muscovy Company, Smythe involved himself in the Muscovy trade. Sailing from Gravesend on 13 June 1603, his party arrived at Arkhangelsk on 22 July, and was taken by way of Kholmogory and Vologda to Yaroslavl, where the tsar was. During that winter, Smythe obtained new privileges for the company. In the spring he went to Moscow to meet with associates. He returned to Arkhangelsk and sailed for England on 28 May 1604.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Tonbridge, the {{youngest}} son of John <b>Judde,</b> Esq., a landowner from a leading local family. His mother, Margaret Chiche, was the granddaughter of an earlier Lord Mayor of London, Robert Chichele, and great-niece of Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Chichele, Sheriff of London. He left for London and apprenticed with the Skinners Company; he was later {{the master of the}} company for four terms. He accumulated a large fortune, part of which he used to establish the Tonbridge School in his home town. During his career as a merchant, he personally traveled to Russia, Spain, and the coast of Africa. He served as one of the Sheriffs of London in 1544, and was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1550. As a result of his vigorous opposition to Wyatt's Rebellion, he gained the favor of Queen Mary and Philip II of Spain. He served as Mayor of the Staple of Calais.|$|E

The town is also home to several Grammar Schools, including The Judd School, Weald of Kent Grammar School and Tonbridge Grammar School for Girls. A number of Tonbridge's secondary schools have specialist status, including Tonbridge Grammar School for Maths and ICT, as well as Languages; Weald of Kent Grammar School for Girls, a specialist school for languages and science; the Judd School for Music with English and also now Science with Maths; Hayesbrook School for boys, a specialist sports college; and Hillview School For Girls, with Performing Arts Status.

5000|$|FoundationThe {{first school}} to be {{associated}} with The Worshipful Company of Skinners was Tonbridge School. This 'Free Grammar School' had been founded in 1553 by Andrew <b>Judde</b> a wealthy London fur trader and native of Tonbridge. On his death governance of the school passed to the Skinners Company where he had been Master for many years. Subsequently, the Skinners Company, like many other City Guilds, took an active interest in supporting education. For many years this took the form of charitable grants and scholarships. However, by the late nineteenth century, there was rising pressure to expand educational provision beyond that currently provided by the existing 'endowed schools' like Tonbridge and the relatively basic, local 'state national schools'. Skinners Company proposals for a second school [...] "at Tonbridge or at some adjacent locality" [...] first emerged in 1870, and after a prolonged row between the two towns Royal Tunbridge Wells was chosen as the location.|$|E

50|$|Sir Richard died on 29 October 1544. He {{had made}} his will on 20 June 1544, in which he styles himself Sir Richard Williams, {{otherwise}} called Sir Richard Cromwell, knt. and of his majesty's privy chamber; he directed that his body should be buried {{in the place where}} he should die; and devises his estates in the counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln, and Bedford, to his eldest son Henry, with the sum of £500 to purchase him necessary furniture, when he should come of age: his estates in Glamorganshire he devises to his son Francis and bequeathed £300 to each of his nieces, Joan, and Ann, daughters of his brother, Walter Cromwell; and directed that if Thomas Wingfield, then Sir Richard's ward, should choose to marry either of them, he should have his wardship remitted to him, otherwise the same should be sold. He also left three of his best great horses to the king, and one other great horse to Lord Cromwell, after the king had chosen: legacies were also left to Sir John Williams, and Sir Edward North, chancellor of the court of augmentation; and to several other persons, who seem to have been servants: Gab. Donne, clerk, Andrew <b>Judde,</b> William Coke, Philip Lentall, and Richard Servington, were appointed executors. His will was proved on 28 November 1546.|$|E
50|$|Knox {{retired in}} 1812, and was succeeded by his younger son, Thomas. The period of Knox's Headmastership {{was one of}} {{national}} economic and political change, but at the school the greatest change {{was to be the}} increasing importance of cricket. John Abercrombie was to be come the school's first cricket blue (for Cambridge) in 1839. In 1818, a nationwide commission visited Tonbridge to investigate on behalf of the reforming government. Over the next few years, a new scheme for the school was prepared and approved by the Lord Chancellor. New buildings were agreed upon by the Governors, and a new dining room and dormitories were built. The School also bought the Georgian building on the High Street {{to the north of the}} new junior school, and it was renamed <b>Judde</b> House. This was the school's second boarding house, with the original buildings serving to house boys of the larger School House. In 1826, the Governors bought the field which now contains the Head cricket ground, and the patches to the north and south of it, later to be called the Upper and Lower Hundreds. In 1838, Knox took the decision to level the Head, a considerable project, using labour and earth from the new railway workings in the town. The labourers often engaged in fights with the boys, as they were lodged nearby. The Head became the focal point of the school and was regarded as one of the most beautiful cricket grounds in the south of England. Thomas Knox died shortly after the completion of his cricket pitch, in 1834, whilst preparing to preach in the parish church. His death brought to an end the 71-year reign of the Knox family.|$|E
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen EBNA 1 is {{the only}} viral protein detectably {{expressed}} in virus genome-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL); recent work has suggested that viral strains with particular EBNA 1 sequence changes are preferentially associated with this tumor and that, within a patient, the tumor-associated variant may have arisen de novo as a rare mutant of the dominant preexisting EBV strain (K. Bhatia, A. Raj, M. J. Gutierrez, J. G. <b>Judde,</b> G. Spangler, H. Venkatesh, and I. T. Magrath, Oncogene 13 : 177 – 181, 1996). In the present work we first study 12 BL patients and show that the virus strain in the tumor is identical in EBNA 1 sequence {{and that it is}} matched at several other polymorphic loci to the dominant strain rescued in vitro from the patient’s normal circulating B cells. We then analyze BL-associated virus strains from three different geographic areas (East Africa, Europe, and New Guinea) alongside virus isolates from geographically matched control donors by using sequence changes in two separate regions of the EBNA 1 gene (N-terminal codons 1 to 60 and C-terminal codons 460 to 510) to identify the EBNA 1 subtype of each virus. Different geographic areas displayed different spectra of EBNA 1 subtypes, with only limited overlap between them; even type 2 virus strains, which tended to be more homogeneous than their type 1 counterparts, showed geographic differences at the EBNA 1 locus. Most importantly, within any one area the EBNA 1 subtypes associated with BL were also found to be prevalent in the general population. We therefore find no evidence that Burkitt lymphomagenesis involves a selection for EBV strains with particular EBNA 1 sequence changes...|$|E
30|$|For other {{antioxidants}} used in {{the present}} study, they were able to lower the increase in PV in shrimp oil-in-water emulsion, compared with the control (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Sample added with lecithin alone showed slightly lower PV than the control after 2  days of storage, indicating its role as antioxidant in the emulsion. Lecithin was found as antioxidant in vegetable oil and fish oil (Chen et al. 2011; <b>Judde</b> et al. 2003). Phosphate residue might act as the chelator of metal, a pro-oxidant in the system. Lecithin possesses the unique chemical structure containing both lipophilic and hydrophilic groups. The antioxidant activity of lecithin was speculated to be due to their ability to form structures within the lipid phase of the emulsions droplets or to chelate metals (Chen et al. 2011). When comparing PV of sample containing EDTA[*]+[*]α-tocopherol and sample added with α-tocopherol alone, {{it was found that the}} sample containing EDTA[*]+[*]α-tocopherol had the lower PV than those of sample added with α-tocopherol alone throughout 12  days of storage (p[*]<[*] 0.05). The result suggested that EDTA alone might have antioxidative activity or exhibited the synergistic effect with α-tocopherol. PV in the sample added with EDTA[*]+[*]α-tocopherol was not different from those found in the sample containing EDTA[*]+[*]tannic acid[*]+[*]α-tocopherol throughout 12  days of storage (p[*]>[*] 0.05). EDTA has been known as the potential metal chelator (Djordjevic et al. 2004; Wang and Regenstein 2009). In emulsion with acidic pH, transition metal ions become soluble (Mette et al. 2007). In the present study, whey protein concentrate was used as an emulsifier. At pH  3.6 used for emulsion preparation, proteins surrounding oil droplets became positively charged (+ 14 to[*]+[*] 16  mV) as determined by zeta potential analysis. Emulsion had the positive charge throughout storage of 12  days (data not shown). Under such a condition, Fe 2 + or Fe 3 + was repelled from oil droplet, thereby preventing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid in the droplets (Surh et al. 2006). The electrical characteristics of emulsions are important because they determine the droplet stability towards aggregation, as well as their interactions with pro-oxidant cationic transition metal ions (Charoen et al. 2011). Thus, whey protein concentrate partially contributed to the oxidative stability of emulsion in conjunction with antioxidants added. It was noted that EDTA scavenged the metal ions in emulsions, thereby lowering lipid oxidation in emulsion. EDTA has been shown to protect lipid oxidation of foods during storage (Djordjevic et al. 2004). In the present study, EDTA in combination with tannic acid and the mixture of EDTA, tannic acid, lecithin and α-tocopherol showed the highest efficacy in retardation of lipid oxidation in emulsion during the storage. It was reported that activity of α-tocopherol could be increased in oil when it was conjugated to the polar head group of lecithin. Lecithin could increase partitioning of the reactive portion of α-tocopherol into the water phase, which could make tocopherol a more efficient free radical scavenger (Laranjinha and Cadenas 1999). Tannic acid contained a large number of hydrophobic portions, which could align themselves at the oil–water interface and functioned as a hydrogen donor or radical scavenger (Maqsood and Benjakul 2010). In the present study, tannic acid in conjunction with EDTA was therefore considered as the most potential antioxidants for prevention of lipid oxidation in shrimp oil-in-water emulsion.|$|E
