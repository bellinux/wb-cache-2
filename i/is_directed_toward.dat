5|$|Discussion of the disorganized {{attachment}} style sometimes includes {{this style}} {{under the rubric}} of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood. Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{is another}} {{staple of the}} city's economy. Perhaps more visible than any other sector, New Orleans' tourist and {{convention}} industry is a $5.5 billion industry that accounts for 40 percent of city tax revenues. In 2004, the hospitality industry employed 85,000 people, making it the city's top economic sector as measured by employment. New Orleans also hosts the World Cultural Economic Forum (WCEF). The forum, held annually at the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> promoting cultural and economic development opportunities through the strategic convening of cultural ambassadors and leaders from around the world. The first WCEF took place in October 2008.|$|E
25|$|Earth's axis remains tilted in {{the same}} {{direction}} with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change (also see Milankovitch cycles).|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Newton's first law of motion, an object moves {{in a straight}} line {{in the absence of any}} external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a physical acts on it; this force is often called a centripetal force, as it <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the center of curvature of the path. Then in {{accordance with}} Newton's third law of motion, there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object, such as a constraint that forces the path to be curved, and this reaction force, the subject of this article, is sometimes called a reactive centrifugal force, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the centripetal force.|$|E
25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a stain on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E

25|$|C. rufifacies is {{of primary}} {{forensic}} {{importance in the}} field of medicocriminal entomology and aids in establishing post mortem intervals. The species will become more significant ecologically, medically, and forensically as it displaces other native species and becomes a dominant blow fly. Future research <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> examining the potential effects of the widespread distribution of this species. C. rufifacies competes with the native Cochliomyia macellaria species and may cause the latter to become extinct. The fly has been successful in competing with other species in many regions of the world. This newly achieved success will require close monitoring of the species to examine its ecological effects and determine any serious involvement in myiasis. Further research in the developmental and successional behavior of the species will allow for more accurate post mortem interval calculations {{in the field of}} medicocriminal entomology.|$|E
500|$|Explaining Church {{teaching}} of this commandment, Kreeft cites Saint Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, [...] "An evil desire {{can only be}} overcome by a stronger good desire." [...] The US Bishops suggest {{that this can be}} achieved through cultivation of goodwill, humility and gratitude for one's own and others' blessings, while trusting in God's grace. Kreeft explains that Saint Paul the Apostle illustrated the concept in his letter to the Philippians when he listed his worldly credentials as a respected Jew and stated, [...] "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." [...] As Jesus stated, [...] "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own [...] Church teaching on the tenth commandment <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> this same attitude toward worldly goods, termed [...] "poverty of spirit".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from that}} of the children, little sympathy <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the bird; David Solkin {{suggests}} the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatoo elicits only careful study. [...] To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatoo's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block out the light from the full moon.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead {{makes the}} startling {{observation}} that [...] "life is comparatively deficient in survival value." [...] If humans can only exist {{for about a}} hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, [...] "they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them." [...] He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life {{is that they are}} actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better. [...] In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction. [...] Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.|$|E

[...] He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, [...] "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." [...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what the hell happened, and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E
