60|$|Willie Case {{had been}} taken to Payson {{to testify before the}} coroner's jury {{investigating}} the death of Giova's father, and with the dollar which The Oskaloosa Kid had given him in the morning burning in his pocket had proceeded to indulge in an orgy of dissipation the moment that he had been freed from the inquest. Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction as he sat alone and by night {{for the first time in}} a public eating place. Willie was now a man of the world, a bon vivant, as he ordered ham and eggs from the pretty waitress of The Elite Restaurant on Broadway; but at heart he was not happy for never before had he realized what a great proportion of his anatomy was made up of hands and feet. As he glanced fearfully at the former, silhouetted against the white of the table cloth, he flushed scarlet, assured as he was that the waitress who had just turned away toward the kitchen with his order was convulsed with laughter and that every other eye in the establishment was glued upon him. To assume an air of nonchalance and thereby impress and disarm his critics Willie reached for a toothpick in the little <b>glass</b> <b>holder</b> near the center of the table and upset the sugar bowl. Immediately Willie snatched back the offending hand and glared ferociously at the ceiling. He could feel the roots of his hair being consumed in the heat of his skin. A quick side glance that required all his will power to consummate showed him that no one appeared to have noticed his faux pas and Willie was again slowly returning to normal when the proprietor of the restaurant came up from behind and asked him to remove his hat.|$|E

5000|$|The podstakannik (подстака́нник, {{literally}} [...] "thing {{under the}} glass"), or tea <b>glass</b> <b>holder,</b> is a holder with a handle, most commonly made of metal that holds a drinking glass (stakan). Their primary {{purpose is to}} be able to hold a very hot glass of tea, which is usually consumed right after it is brewed. The stability of the glass on the table is also significantly improved. It is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other post-Soviet states.|$|E

5000|$|The podstakannik ('подстаканник'), or tea <b>glass</b> <b>holder</b> (literally [...] "thing {{under the}} glass"), {{is a part}} of Russian tea tradition. A Russian tea glass-holder is a {{traditional}} way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, other CIS and ex-USSR countries. Expensive podstakanniks are made from silver, classic series are made mostly from nickel silver, cupronickel, and other alloys with nickel, silver or gold plating. In Russia, it is customary to drink tea brewed separately in a teapot and diluted with freshly boiled water ('pair-of-teapots tea', 'чай парой чайников'). Traditionally, the tea is very strong, its strength often indicating the hosts' degree of hospitality. The traditional implement for boiling water for tea used to be the samovar (and sometimes it still is, though usually electric). Tea is a family event, and is usually served after each meal with sugar (one to three teaspoonfuls per cup) and lemon (but without milk), and an assortment of jams, pastries and confections. Black tea is commonly used, with green tea gaining popularity as a more healthy, more [...] "Oriental" [...] alternative. Teabags are not used in the traditional Russian tea ceremony, only loose, large-leaf black tea.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] (or , {{pronounced}} [...] "no-nick") {{a variation}} on the conical design, where the glass bulges out a couple of inches from the top; this is partly for improved grip, partly to prevent the glasses from sticking together when stacked, and partly to give strength and stop the rim from becoming chipped or [...] "nicked". This design was invented by Hugo Pick, of Albert Pick & Co., who was awarded two US patents: design patent 44,616 (September 2, 1913) and patent 1,107,700 (August 18, 1914) - though the design patent was invalidated - and which was commercialized as Nonik (for [...] "no-nick"). The design was preceded by many other bulged glass designs, dating to the mid-19th century, which differed in having a severe bulge and different purposes (a stop for a jar cover, or placement in a soda <b>glass</b> <b>holder),</b> rather than the shallow bulge of this design. The original motivation for the glass was to reduce breakage when stacking (40% greater crushing strength and curved surface where rim touches), reduce breakage when tipped over (due to the bulge protecting the rim from impact), improve grip, and facilitate cleaning (due to shallow curves, compared to more severe curves). In the United Kingdom, this style was popularized after World War II, with Ravenhead glass introducing a Nonik glass in 1948.|$|E
3000|$|Photocatalytic {{activity}} during the oxidative destruction of NO {{was determined by}} measuring the concentration of NO gas at the outlet of the reactor (373  cm 3) during photoirradiation under a constant flow of 1  ppm NO- 50  vol.% air (balanced N 2) mixed gas (200  cm 3  min− 1) [15]. Since illumination area is the key point in the continuous gas phase photocatalytic reaction, all powder photocatalysts were laid flat on the same <b>glass</b> <b>holder</b> with a certain area. Approximately 0.04  g of powder catalyst was placed into a 20 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 0.5  mm <b>glass</b> <b>holder,</b> which was kept in the bottom center of the reactor. The mixed gas with a flowing velocity of 200  cm 3 /min continuously passed through the reactor.

According to a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), the deNOx characterization was carried out around room temperature. At the outlet of the reactor, the concentration of NO was determined using a NOx analyzer (Yanaco, ECL- 88 A) [16]. The characterization system used in the present research was {{similar to that of the}} Japanese Industrial Standard which was established at the beginning of 2004 [17].

50|$|Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to {{keep the}} candle upright. In this case, a candle that is {{slightly}} too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders {{were made in the}} same place, so they were appropriately sized, but international trade has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers.

30|$|A 1 -in. {{cylindrical}} specimen, {{which is}} {{fixed to the}} quartz <b>glass</b> tube <b>holder</b> by using quartz fiber, can be heated up {{to a maximum of}} 700 ^∘C. The cylindrical axis of the specimen is set parallel to that of the glass tube, which is also fixed along the spinning axis by using a collet. Thus, the cylindrical specimen’s axis aligns parallel to the spinning axis of TSpin. After adjusting the angle of the glass tube so as to make the specimen’s orientation marker line vertical using a laser level (Fig.  2), the collet is tightened to fix the specimen to the spinning axis. The specimen’s marker can be adjusted within a few degrees from the vertical. Fixing the glass tube with the collet reduces wobbling during spinning and enables precise orientation of the specimen.|$|R

The specimen is ignited in the <b>glass</b> <b>holder</b> with the mixed flow of oxygen and nitrogen so the entire top tip of them is burning like a candle, and if the specimen burns for at least 3  min after the igniter is removed, or if the specimen burns down 50  mm, the oxygen concentration is judged above the oxygen index (OI). Instead, if the specimen stops flaming before those criteria, the oxygen concentration is below the OI. The procedure is repeated with upper and lower oxygen concentrations by 0.5  % until the lowest concentration of oxygen that will satisfy the criteria is determined.
