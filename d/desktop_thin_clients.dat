50|$|While {{the server}} must be robust {{enough to handle}} several client {{sessions}} at once, <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> hardware requirements are minimal {{compared to that of}} a traditional PC <b>desktop.</b> Most <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> have low energy processors, flash storage, memory, and no moving parts. This reduces the cost and power consumption, making them affordable to own and easy to replace or deploy. Since <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> consist of fewer hardware components than a traditional desktop PC, they can operate in more hostile environments. And because they typically don't store critical data locally, risk of theft is minimized because {{there is little or no}} user data to be compromised.|$|R
50|$|With HP RGS all the processing, {{including}} hardware-accelerated graphics {{with the}} latest OpenGL or DirectX rendering is done on the workstation and only compressed bitmap images (the screen) are sent to the client device. HP RGS is distinguished by its proprietary compression algorithms which allows for real-time transmission of complex 3D images and video, which traditional remote desktop protocols struggle with. This opens up the use of remote <b>desktops</b> and <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> to graphics-intensive industries such as CAD, oil and gas exploration, animation, architecture engineering and construction which previously required local workstations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Limitations in the {{contemporary}} best effort WAN combined {{with an increase in}} demand of the business users for multimedia are the main challenges for remote <b>desktop</b> solutions. <b>Thin</b> <b>client</b> remote <b>desktop</b> protocols are mature enough to work efficiently over low bandwidth and low quality links for normal office applications. However, they face significant challenges when working with more demanding data flows such as multimedia streams. This paper introduces the server side of the architecture for remote desktop environment aiming at improving user perception of the more demanding and network sensitive multimedia applications and services. In this approach we provide a multilayer framework for mapping of user perceived Quality of Service (QoS) onto network level performance parameters in order to improve overall end-to-end QoS. The set of perception rules defined for each application and type of user triggers the adaptation mechanisms to change the multimedia transmission parameters in order to meet end user expectations. The adaptation mechanisms optimize the usage of the available network resources for different flows and for all clients connected to the same server module. Such optimization is reflecting the changes in network conditions and user perception. The mechanisms presented in this paper are designed for optimization of resource usage in dedicated links but the architecture can be easily extended. Our final goal is improvement in performance of remote terminal services over the best-effort networks such as the Internet...|$|R
40|$|The word Cloud {{is used as}} {{a metaphor}} for the internet, based on {{standardised}} use of a cloud like shape to denote a network. Cloud Computing is advanced technology for resource sharing through network with less cost as compare to other technologies. Cloud infrastructure supports various models IAAS, SAAS, PAAS. The term virtualization in cloud computing is very useful today. With the help of virtualization, more than one operating system is supported with all resources on single H/W. We can also say that we acquired single server but we used it for multiple functions(Web Server, database server, Application Server, DNS Server, DHCP Server). One more asset of cloud computing is Multi Tenancy. Sharing of one database to many tenants or we can say users is known as multi tenancy. Cloud computing customize the requirements of user and u r able to pay as per use. Network applications share through multi tenancy for various users but security of data is basic issue. This paper discusses about the security with more encryption routines and upgrades performance with network route optimization. Due to increase in performance and security, more number of people attract towards CLOUD COMPUTING. Virtualization is a term of cloud computing. Virtualization is a very new technology in computer technologies. With the help of virtualization share the resources software and hardware. Best example of virtualization is <b>THIN</b> <b>CLIENT</b> technology, which runs more than one client with one server. Desktop virtualization shares the <b>desktop</b> with other <b>thin</b> <b>client.</b> Security and Performance issues link with desktop virtualization also.

A prototype of a video communication system based on H. 323 family of ITU-T recommendations is used to demonstrate the support of multimedia applications with a terminal server and <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> such as Windows-based terminals. The studies on the network applications over <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> are composed of two parts: (1) the collaborative client–server conference system and (2) the universal plug-in architecture. With the proposed architecture, an application of multi-user audio/video conference system is devised for illustrative purposes. The universal plug-in technique is devised to shift jobs from <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> to a supporting server, thus reducing the computing overhead required by the clients. The processed result at the supporting server is transcoded to a pre-defined universal format and then {{sent back to the}} <b>thin</b> <b>client.</b> This plug-in architecture is implemented and empirically evaluated.
