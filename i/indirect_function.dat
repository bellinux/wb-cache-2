40|$|AbstractWe {{analyze the}} least {{increment}} function, a convex function of n variables associated to an n-person cooperative game. Another convex representation of cooperative games, the <b>indirect</b> <b>function,</b> {{has previously been}} studied. At every point the least increment function is {{greater than or equal}} to the <b>indirect</b> <b>function,</b> and both functions coincide in the case of convex games, but an example shows that they do not necessarily coincide if the game is totally balanced but not convex. We prove that the least increment function of a game contains all the information of the game if and only if the game is totally balanced. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be the least increment function of a game as well as an expression for the core of a game in terms of its least increment function...|$|E
40|$|Like {{common pool}} resources, a central task {{in real life}} {{managerial}} problems concerns the sustain-ability of the resource. Especially in areas where multilateral agreements are non-binding, compliance becomes a crucial issue {{in order to avoid}} a destruction of a natural resource. Compliance can be achieved if agents exercise self-constraint and refrain from using their powers to exploit one another. Then a solution can be obtained that is acceptable for all participants- say a fair compromise. Such a compromise will be considered a fair outcome that produces a common virtual world where com-pliance is reality and obstruction be held to account. Rather than considering fairness as some cloudy concept, in order to advance our understanding of compliance on non-binding agreements, we study a fairness solution that is based on the cooperative game theory’s pre-kernel. Other solutions such as the Shapley value are usually considered a more attractive concept for solving economical problems or for experimental studies, which might however originate in its simplicity of computation. In this paper, we review and improve an approach invented by Meseguer-Artola (1997) to compute the pre-kernel of a cooperative game by the <b>indirect</b> <b>function.</b> The <b>indirect</b> <b>function</b> is known as the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation of the characteristic function introduced by Martinez-Legaz (1996). Following and ex-tending the approach proposed by Meseguer-Artola (1997) with the <b>indirect</b> <b>function,</b> we are able to characterize the pre-kernel of the grand coalition simply by the solution sets of a family of quadratic objective functions. Now, each function can be easily solved by means well known from analysis and linear algebra...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify the functions of the supplier to the client firms and explore the impacts of these functions on the relationship quality. For the client firm, what functions of the supplier relationship are really expected and what functions are not so important? The answers to these questions may guide client firms in the selection of the strategic suppliers and guide the supplier firms on how {{to meet the demands of}} the client firms, resulting in a better cooperative relationship. In addition, other variables have impacts on the process in which the functions of supplier quality influence the relationship quality. The findings are as follows. The client firm with different nature of ownership does not perceive the direct functions of supplier relationship differently, but it perceives the <b>indirect</b> <b>functions</b> differently. Foreign invested firm values the long term development of the relationship with the supplier, implying that it emphasize the <b>indirect</b> <b>functions</b> of the supplier more than the state-owned or domestic private firm. Large firms have higher requirements on the <b>indirect</b> <b>functions</b> than medium sized and small firms. Foreign invested firms are easier to have trust in its supplier and make commitment with the supplier, thus enjoying higher relationship quality than state-owned or domestic private businesses. The duration of the relationship impacts the client on the perception of the functions of the supplier relationship. The longer cooperation history leads to the client's higher requirement on the cost <b>function</b> and the <b>indirect</b> <b>functions</b> and leads to the higher degree of trust of the client in the supplier. The functions of the supplier relationship significantly impact on the B 2 B relationship quality. The cost, quality, innovation development and market functions have more influences on the client's commitment with the supplier. The quality, social support and innovation development functions have more influences on the client's trust in the supplier. The quality, scout and market functions are negatively related to the conflict dimension of the relationship quality...|$|R
