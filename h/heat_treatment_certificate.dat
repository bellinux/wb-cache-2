40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> on {{material}} properties of SiC/Ti- 15 - 3 {{was measured by}} vibration tests. <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> changes the microstructure, which was found to stiffen the matrix and reduce its damping capacity. Test results indicate how these changes in the matrix affect the corresponding properties of the composite. Measurements show that <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> affects damping properties of the composite {{to a greater extent}} than stiffness properties. The extent of change in mechanical properties is shown to depend on <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature and exposure time...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{commercial}} <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> on physical and mechanical properties of compression wood (CW) and opposite wood (OW) of black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) was investigated. Black pine logs containing CW were cut {{parallel to the}} pith and separated into CW and OW sections. A commercial <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> process was applied to pine lumber at 180 and 210 ºC for 3 hours. Water absorption (WA), contact angle (CA), swelling, modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and impact bending strength (IBS) were measured. The results showed that <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> decreased water absorption and swelling of the CW and OW of black pine. <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 210 °C temperature decreased the longitudinal swelling of CW by 51. 4 %. Higher immersion time lowered the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> on the WA values. The CA values of the CW and OW increased due to <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> reduced the MOR, MOE, and IBS values. The results indicated that MOR, MOE, and CA values were highly affected in the CW; on the other hand, the IBS value was highly affected in the OW by <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> compared to control groups. The results indicate that heat-stabilized CW can be used more widely and effectively in the forest products industry...|$|R
40|$|The eVect of mild <b>heat</b> <b>treatments,</b> {{applied to}} whole kiwifruit, on {{physical}} characteristics and chemical composition of minimally processed fruit was studied. Fruits {{were subjected to}} <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> at 45 °C for 25 and 75 min, cooled for 24 h, minimally processed and stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Heat-treated fruits showed increased respiration rates in the Wrst 2 days of storage. Samples colour was marginally aVected either by <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> or by minimal processing. The application of <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> leads to an increment of slices Wrmness due to cross linking between demethylated galacturonic acid chains and endogenous calcium. An increment in sucrose, Lmalic, citric, quinic and ascorbic acids was observed {{as a consequence of}} applied <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 45 °C for 25 min applied to whole fruits allows quality retention of minimally processed fruit during 9 days at 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|A mucoadhesive spray-dried starch/poly(acrylic acid) powder {{underwent}} different <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> {{in order}} to induce cross-linking between the functional groups of starch (Amioca (R)) and poly(acrylic acid) (Carbopol (R) 974 P). After <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> the water-absorbing capacity, viscosity and elasticity of the mucoadhesive powder increased. NMR analysis in combination with FT-IR indicated that <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> induced a low degree of cross-linking between the polymers. Nasal administration of Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powders without <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in an absolute bioavailability in rabbits of 8. 2 +/- 3. 0 % for insulin. Due to the difference in water-absorbing capacity (which opened the tight junctions of the nasal mucosa), elasticity and plasticity (which reduced mucociliairy clearance and prolonged residence time) <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 120 degrees C improved the bioavailability: 26. 4 +/- 21. 9, 36. 5 +/- 11. 0 and 19. 3 +/- 17. 3 % after <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> during 30 min, 1 h and 4 h, respectively. <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 60 degrees C was less efficient. This study demonstrated that the nasal insulin absorption improved via <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powder (prior to the addition of insulin). The bioavailability-enhancing effect of a 1 h <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 120 degrees C was confirmed using the same polymer matrix in combination with different drugs (salmon calcitonin, human growth hormone and metoprolol tartrate).
