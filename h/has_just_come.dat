25|$|In {{early modern}} Spain, she appears or is alluded to in works by Quevedo and other writers {{as well as}} in a number of plays by Lope de Vega. In a play {{entitled}} The Holy League, Titian appears on stage at the Venetian Senate, and stating that he <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> from visiting the Sultan, displays his painting of Sultana Rossa or Roxelana.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of {{the medal}} shows a Norwegian Viking {{chieftain}} who <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> ashore from his ship (seen behind him) and is armed for war, with horned helmet, shield, sword, and svard (dagger). He {{is intended to}} be landing at Vinland, the lands in the Americas explored and to some extent settled by the Vikings about the year 1000. The helmet is most likely an anachronism, as they are not believed to have been used for two millennia prior to the Vinland landing, and were probably ceremonial, rather than intended for battle. The centennial and the years are recognized on the obverse. The reverse shows a Viking ship, along with the authorization by Congress and the approximate year in which Vinland was settled. [...] "OPUS FRASER" [...] (Fraser's work), the artist's signature, is {{to the left of the}} ship.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never {{to take it}} for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E

Phaedrus <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> from the home of Epicrates of Athens, where Lysias, son of Cephalus, has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is [...] "sick with passion for hearing speeches", walks into the countryside with Phaedrus hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech. [...] They sit by a stream under a plane tree and a chaste tree, {{and the rest of the}} dialogue consists of oration and discussion.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Collision", Bennet {{is first}} seen {{standing}} over Matt Parkman, who is {{strapped to a}} gurney. Bennet calmly converses with Matt, advising him to relax. Bennet also checks the readout of a machine used to gauge when Parkman is trying to read Bennet's mind. Bennet explains that the Haitian is blocking Matt's powers. Nevertheless, Matt is able to pull the name [...] "Claire" [...] from Bennet's mind. Bennet is impressed by Matt's growing ability, and then tells the Haitian to [...] "go deep" [...] with Matt, who is last heard screaming. That morning, back at the Bennet house, Bennet finds that a distraught Claire <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> home. Bennet assumes from Claire's bare, mud-covered feet that she was out all night. Bennet has to get to work, but states that they'll talk later. He is then seen monitoring Nathan Petrelli, who has just had a one-night stand with Niki/Jessica Sanders. Bennet tells the Haitian to kidnap [...] "just the one" [...] (Nathan).|$|E

After having an argument with Tom about him hacking into the school's website to change his grades and deciding the family needs some good old-fashioned togetherness, Stuart takes them to a holiday home {{in the middle of}} nowhere. Joining them is Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Pearson (Andy Richter), his 14-year-old son Jake (Austin Butler), Nana Rose (Doris Roberts), and identical 12-year-old twins Art (Henri Young) and Lee (Regan Young). Ricky also arrives unexpectedly and talks his way into staying overnight, by giving them the impression that his car has broken down and needs to be repaired so he can spend time with Bethany, plus saying he is 18 years old.|$|E

2500|$|Cimino's next film, Heaven's Gate (1980), debuted to lacerating {{reviews and}} took in only $3 million in ticket sales, {{effectively}} leaving United Artists bankrupt. The failure of Heaven's Gate led several critics to revise {{their positions on}} The Deer Hunter. Canby said in his famous review of Heaven's Gate, [...] " [...] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> around to collect." [...] Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven's Gate, [...] "I'm a little surprised {{that many of the}} same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm." [...] Sarris added, [...] "I was never taken in... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter." [...] In his book Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven's Gate, Steven Bach wrote, [...] "critics seemed to feel obliged to go on the record about The Deer Hunter, to demonstrate that their critical credentials were un-besmirched by having been, as Sarris put it, 'taken in.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... Abu Bakr {{sent for}} me {{at a time when}} the Yamama battles had {{witnessed}} the martyrdom of numerous Companions. I found 'Umar bin al-Khattab with him. Abu Bakr began, Umar <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> to me and said, 'In the Yamama battles death has dealt most severely with the qurra', and I fear it will deal with them with equal severity in other theatres of war. As a result much of the Quran will be gone. [...] " [...] 'I am therefore of the opinion that you should command the Quran be collected.'" [...] Abu Bakr continued, [...] "I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him. Zaid, you are young and intelligent, you used to record the revelations for Muhammad, and we know nothing to your discredit. So pursue the Quran and collect it together." [...] By Allah, had they asked me to move a mountain it could not have been weightier than what they requested of me now".

2500|$|On a pretext, Poirot makes Japp {{call at the}} mews {{house and}} while they are there Poirot sneaks {{another look at the}} {{cupboard}} under the stairs and sees that the attaché-case has gone. As Miss Plenderleith <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> back from playing golf at Wentworth, they go there and find out that she was seen on the links with the case. Later investigations show that she was seen to throw the item into the lake there. The police retrieve it but find nothing in it. Poirot asks Japp and Miss Plenderleith to call at his flat and they tell her of Eustace's arrest. Poirot then tells her of his real conclusions. From clues concerning missing blotting paper, Poirot deduces that Mrs Allen had written a letter just before she died, which if she killed herself, would indicate a suicide note. [...] He postulates that Miss Plenderleith came home, found her friend dead, driven to kill herself by the actions of her blackmailer and was determined to avenge her – this wasn't a murder made to look like suicide but a suicide made to look like murder and thereby entrapping the blackmailer. Miss Plenderleith placed the gun in Mrs Allen's right hand, {{despite the fact that she}} was left-handed, and the purpose of her trip to Wentworth was to hide there the dead lady's golf clubs – left-handed clubs, the attaché-case being a red herring to put the police off the trail. [...] Convinced by Poirot that Major Eustace will be imprisoned for his other crimes, she agrees to tell the truth and save the man from the gallows.|$|E
