50|$|Romain Puertolas {{was born}} on December 21, 1975 in Montpellier in {{southern}} France. He is {{the only child of}} a Spanish Army colonel (his father) and a French army administrator (his mother). He was an airport controller in Madrid, Spain. Puertolas became a police officer and border guard in France at age 33. As a police officer he specialized in examining document fraud in <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>networks</b> in France. After the success of his first novel, he quit this police job in December 2014 to work on writing further novels.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic implications of border control policies and internal enforcement measures for {{the pattern of}} <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> and the sectoral allocation of clandestine foreign workers. It is argued that efforts to control <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in sectors where they traditionally find employment may trigger the formation of networks supporting clandestine foreign workers in new locations and occupations where the probability of detection is relatively lower. The end result may {{be an increase in}} the overall stock of illegal immigrants residing in the economy. <b>Illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> · <b>networks...</b>|$|R
3000|$|Since <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> to China has severe legal {{consequences}} and dismal outcomes,h potentially illegal immigrants must have greater confidence under those external constraints. Actually, only the <b>immigration</b> <b>networks</b> at destinations can provide newcomers {{with that kind}} of knowledge and information. According to the cumulative causation theory, the longer one resides in a destination country, the better one can understand the information, rules and regulations, and potential loopholes in that country's enforcement. It can thus be assumed that communities' social capital at the destination will have an increasingly predictive power on one's migration behavior. This leads to the following three hypotheses: [...]...|$|R
40|$|High-skill {{immigrants}} form {{networks that}} facilitate subsequent low-skill immigration. To minimize {{the effects of}} low-skill immigration on unemployment, a strict lean-against-the-wind strategy or a flexible lean-against-the-wind strategy that is supported by, and {{takes into account the}} effect of, border control, are considered. None of these policies is necessarily better than the other as regards leniency toward low-skill immigration as well as the number of <b>illegal</b> immigrants. High-skill <b>immigration</b> increases <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> when the effect of migrant networks on the supply of low-skill immigrants is greater than the job-creation effect of these <b>networks.</b> Migrant <b>networks,</b> <b>immigration</b> dynamics, low-skill <b>immigration,</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> unemployment, lean-against-the-wind policy rules...|$|R

40|$|The {{concern over}} the issue of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into South Africa has {{resulted}} in widespread incidents of violent confrontation between the noted illegal immigrants and especially the impoverished South Africans. The need to manage <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> effectively and efficiently is one of the primary issues around preserving the security of all South Africans and the state. There are good policies to address <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into the country but implementation is the major challenge confronting authorities. The study employed document analysis to provide answers to the research question. The researcher complemented the approach with interviews. One of the major findings was the need to close gaps in managing <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into South Africa and to ensure that all the state institutions work cooperatively in stamping out illicit activities accompanying <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into the country. <b>Illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> is manageable...|$|R
50|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in China {{is a major}} problem, {{particularly}} with North Korean refugees and defectors fleeing their country.

5000|$|Another study {{conducted}} by Waldman and colleagues analyzed three cable commentators: Lou Dobbs, Bill O’Reilly, and Glenn Beck and their discussion of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration.</b>  These results concluded that 70% of the Lou Dobbs Tonight episodes in 2007 contained discussion of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> 56% of the O’Reilly Factor episodes in 2007 discussed <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> and Glenn Beck discussed <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in 28% of his year 2007 programs. As a result of popular shows labeling Hispanics as [...] "illegal immigrants" [...] and often portraying Hispanics in a negative light, these programs gave anti-immigration activists a platform for discrimination.|$|R
40|$|Arising {{from the}} {{supposed}} {{negative impact of}} <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> including security threats as well as recent xenophobic violence, the South African Government would like to counter <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration.</b> To do this, it needs to understand {{the root causes of}} <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into the country. This article, therefore, seeks to explain and interpret why illegal immigrants make South Africa their ideal choice of destination. To provide a context, the article begins with a discussion on the research setting, that is, the South African international boundaries. Thereafter, the article discusses the concept of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> from the South African context before reviewing literature on the number of illegal immigrants in South Africa and the supposed impact. The article then explores literature on international movements and discusses established migration frameworks that explain and interpret these movements. Lastly, to confirm some facts arising from the review, we interviewed officials that manage <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> as well as detained immigrants. We establish that four migration streams that have created a blended society in Southern Africa sparked <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into South Africa. The article conclude that the problem of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> into South Africa is perpetuated by deep-rooted migration networks. Therefore, if the South African Government wants to avert <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> its policy-makers should examine these roots and take them into account to arrive at a solution that is in sync with the root causes of the problem...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} among political ideological orientations, exposure to news from public service and commercial broadcasters, and attitudes toward <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration.</b> Based on a comparative data set of a survey administered simultaneously in the United States, France, and Norway, we hypothesize that commercial news broadcasting drives stricter attitudes toward <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> than public service broadcasting does. The findings suggest that political orientation is the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in all three countries. In addition, we find that exposure to commercial news broadcasting is positively related to negative attitudes toward <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in the United States, France, and Norway. Public service broadcasting, in contrast, leads to {{more positive attitudes toward}} <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> in the United States but not in France and Norway.

40|$|A theological-ethical {{judgement}} of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> The {{immigration of}} people is a growing global phenomenon. People immigrate to South Africa mainly for economic purposes. Not all immigrants are,however, legally in the country. It is not certain how many illegal immigrants are in the country.

40|$|Border {{enforcement}} of immigration laws attempts {{to raise the}} costs of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> while interior enforcement also lowers the benefits.
