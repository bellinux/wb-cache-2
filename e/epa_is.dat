25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or {{sometimes}} U.S. <b>EPA)</b> <b>is</b> an {{agency of the}} federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting {{human health and the environment}} by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt. The <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> not a Cabinet department, but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank.|$|E
25|$|The FQPA {{requires}} that pesticide registration be reviewed periodically, {{with a goal}} of once every 15 years. The FQPA mandated changes {{in the collection of}} tolerance fee’s, increasing the amount of fee money from $14 million to $16 million to help with the reassessment of tolerances. The FQPA requires the EPA to specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the endocrine system. The FQPA requires the EPA to establish an integrated pest management education program and implement integrated pest management research and demonstration. The FQPA encourages the syncing of U.S. pesticide tolerances with those of international standards. Under the FQPA individual states are not allowed to set different pesticide tolerances than the EPA and the <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to coordinate data requirements between the state and federal levels. The <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to develop and distribute a food safety brochure and create an annual report on the progress of its registration program.|$|E

25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>is</b> {{promoting}} {{the marketing of}} greener cars via the SmartWay program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle's Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In humans, DHA {{is either}} {{obtained}} from the diet or may be converted in small amounts from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω-3) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 ω-3) as an intermediate. This synthesis had been thought to occur through an elongation step followed {{by the action of}} Δ4-desaturase. It is now considered more likely that DHA is biosynthesized via a C24 intermediate followed by beta oxidation in peroxisomes. Thus, <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> twice elongated, yielding 24:5 ω-3, then desaturated to 24:6 ω-3, then shortened to DHA (22:6 ω-3) via beta oxidation. This pathway is known as Sprecher's shunt.|$|E
25|$|In the United States since 2006, {{the maximum}} {{concentration}} {{in drinking water}} allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>is</b> 10 ppb and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water. The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5mg/m3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) to a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.01mg/m3, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL) to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002mg/m3.

25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal {{was a poor}} one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of UBS Investment Research, said Dynegy is {{far more likely to}} shutter all five coal-powered plants rather than add pollution control devices. Dumoulin-Smith pointed out that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).|$|E

2500|$|The FQPA {{established}} a new safety standard (reasonable certainty of no harm) {{that must be}} applied to all food commodities. In addition to the new standard the EPA now has to consider the specific risks pesticides might have for infants and children. The FQPA required the re-testing of all existing pesticide tolerance levels within 10 years. [...] When assessing this risk the <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required {{to take into account}} the “aggregate risk” (the exposure to a pesticide from multiple sources) and the “cumulative exposure” to pesticides with similar mechanisms of toxicity. To do this the <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to establish new science polices to assess the risks. [...] The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions).|$|E
2500|$|Alternatives to {{pesticides}} {{are available}} and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding.

These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The FQPA {{requires}} the EPA {{to establish a}} list of pests that are considered significant to public health and to give special consideration to pesticides with public health uses.
