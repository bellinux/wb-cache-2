40|$|Impulse Radio (IR) is an ultra-wide bandwidth, time-hopping, Code DivisionMultiple Access (CDMA) {{technology}} that possesses unique characteristics {{that make it}} a promis-ing candidate for future tactical military radio networks. In this paper, we present {{an analysis of the}} bit error perfor-mance of IR using hard <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> and soft <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> techniques in an environment with dense multiple access interference and large near- far ratios, including se-vere interference from several local transmitters and a large number of distant interferers and thermal noise. The results show that hard <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> performs better than soft <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> in the presence of several large interfer-ers. We discuss the tradeos between hard <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> and soft <b>decision</b> <b>detection,</b> and we also compare the perfor-mance of hard <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> and soft <b>decision</b> <b>detection</b> with blanking.

40|$|Fluctuations {{in rates}} of gene {{expression}} can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch {{point in a}} pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny <b>decision</b> <b>circuit</b> as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations.
