Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E

40|$|Based on firm‐level payroll {{data from}} around 2000 member firms of the British Engineering Employers' Federation {{we examine the}} {{behavior}} of real hourly earnings over the 1927 ‐ 1937 cycle that contained the Great Depression. The pay statistics are based on adult male blue‐collar workers within engineering and metal working firms. They allow us to distinguish between pieceworkers and timeworkers and they are delineated by 14 occupations and 51 travel‐to‐work <b>geographical</b> <b>engineering</b> districts. We measure the cycle using national unemployment rates as well as rates that match our district breakdowns. Differences {{are found in the}} real hourly earnings cyclicality of pieceworkers and timeworkers. We attempt to relate our findings to those of modern micro panel data studies of real wage cyclicality. We offer some insight into why the estimates of real hourly pay display less procyclicality during the 1920 s and 1930 s than in studies based on more recent data.

30|$|Microbial induced {{carbonate}} precipitation (MICP) is {{a common}} occurrence of geochemistry influences in many fields, such as biological, <b>geographical,</b> and <b>engineering</b> systems. However, the processes that control interactions between carbonate biomineralization and biofilm properties are poorly understood. We develop a method for real time, in situ and nondestructive imaging with confocal scanning microscopy. This method provides a possible way to observe biomineralization process and the morphology of biomineralized deposits within biofilms. We use this method to show calcite biominerals produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms which extremely change biofilm structures. The distribution of calcite precipitation produced in situ biomineralization is highly heterogeneous in biofilms and also to occur primarily {{on the bottom of}} biofilms. It is distinct from those usual expectations that mineral started to precipitate from surface of biofilm. Our results reveal that biomineralization plays a comprehensive regulation function on biofilm architecture and properties.|$|R
30|$|Information {{and energy}} are {{exchanged}} through the interdependence interface. The interdependencies are constructed based on certain strategies {{that can be}} classified as either topological, operational, or both. Many topological strategies have been formulated and compared in previous research; however, these typically neglect the <b>geographical</b> and <b>engineering</b> constraints in practical physical operational situations in a CPPS. An important constraint when allocating interdependencies is geographic closeness. For example, in a control and communication network, it is not feasible to receive electricity from a geographically distant node in the power grid due to the associated cost and physical constraints. Therefore, the interdependence strategy outlined in this paper {{is based on the}} classification of node categories and their geographic closeness, which include the control center, backbone, and accessing nodes. The physical nodes belonging to each category are interconnected with the corresponding cyber layer nodes belonging to the same category that have the shortest geographical distance. The control center nodes are autonomous, and there are no direct interdependencies between the control center and physical nodes. For a CPPS with sufficient geographic information, the nodes in each layer that belong to the same category are listed based on their geographic distance to the chosen reference location. Owing to the lack of actual geographic information regarding the IEEE standard power system, for simulating the geographical distance, node numbers are used in this paper to represent the geographic distance to the chosen reference location. For this reason, the nodes belonging to the same category in each layer are relisted using the node number. The interdependencies are constructed by interconnecting the nodes in the same sequence for the backbone nodes and accessing nodes in cyber and physical layers.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the necessity to}} make changes in the university curriculum in accordance with the requirements of today. Modern cartography is integrated with GIS and remote sensing and in this context we see the prospect of training experts at universities. GIS education has some specific features that distinguish it from other types of training such as the interdisciplinary nature, a wide range of highly informative software applications, a combination of <b>geographical</b> and <b>engineering</b> knowledge. GIS specialists must have system knowledge and skills in the design, operation and development in this field. Only intensive use of mapping, GIS, geodetic, and photogrammetric knowledge and methods in scientific research and their effective use in the practice of modern production allow the international community to achieve high results. The main directions of educational programs at the Department of Geodesy and Cartography are preservation and further development of the rich heritage of scientific and pedagogical achievements of higher cartographical education in Ukraine; the study and involvement in the educational process of the best achievements of foreign higher education; preparation and updating of scientific and methodological support of educational process; modernization of material and technical basis for the learning process and field training practices; involvement of new professional teaching staff; training of the faculty staff. The demand on mapping courses and related workshops at the Department of Geodesy and Cartography Geography Department is determined by certain factors: the growth of interdisciplinary research involving extensive mapping component; growing of demand for mapping and GIS products from scientific, practical, commercial, and educational institutions; the need to increase productivity in the field of cartography, geoinformatics and adjacent to their fields of study and practice; issues of general improvement of geo-mapping education...|$|R

The research programme was commissioned and funded by the Knowledge Foundation (KK Stiftelsen) of Sweden and the British Council’s UK ‘Overseas Student Scholarship Scheme’. The research investigates pioneering approaches to supporting the maintenance and servicing complex machine systems in remote physical and <b>geographical</b> locations., Virtual <b>engineering</b> models had been used previously {{in the design and}} development lifecycle of manufacturing machine systems; this study pioneered the use of such tools in the operational phase of machinery (including service and maintenance). However, the key innovation was tight integration between these virtual engineering tools and Internet-based support tools. The system architecture was verified by implementations using different toolsets and various Internet technologies. A case study approach was used in the implementation forms of the testbeds, which include a prototype cylinder head (Volvo), an assembly cell at Euromaint and a robotic multiple press line at AP&T. This novel approach to remote machine service support devised in this collaborative study informed the strategies and investments made by Euromaint, a special purpose machine systems builder, for the remote support of clients’ systems (in Sweden and worldwide).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the practices of transit agencies and riders in Boston and Los Angeles, focusing especially on the work of Boston's T Riders Union (TRU) and Los Angeles' Bus Riders Union (BRU). These transportation justice organizations advocate for accessible and affordable service for all riders, especially those in lower income communities of color. My analysis is grounded in a multi‐disciplinary urban studies approach and participatory observation. While economic, <b>engineering,</b> <b>geographical,</b> and environmental considerations influence my perspective, this work is largely within the framework of cultural anthropology. In the summer of 2008, I worked full‐time as an intern with Alternatives for Community and Environment, TRU's parent organization, attending transit agency meetings, canvassing with organizers, and riding buses and trains throughout the Boston area. Similarly in 2009, I worked with the BRU, attending meetings, conducting outreach on buses with organizers, and working on publicity materials. I came to understand not only the activist and organizing work of these community groups, but also, through relying on the bus and subway for my daily transportation, the way urban space was practiced through route maps and timetables. I put these firsthand experiences into conversation with the theoretical works of Bourdieu, De Certeau, Foucault, Harvey, Lefebvre, Merry, and Soja. I first discuss the role capitalist logic has historically played in structuring urban transportation planning and infrastructure. Turning to today's transportation agencies, I consider their spatial practices. I then describe how transportation justice organizations formulate and leverage particular publics to fight for their mobility concerns. Ultimately, I argue that such organizations challenge the hegemony of capitalist logic in urban space, successfully highlighting the masked rationality of urban planning and organizing ordinary practitioners of the city to assert their right to the city...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis {{explores the}} {{knowledge}} sharing {{that takes place}} during the requirement engineering phase of globally distributed information systems development. In recent years, due to globalization, information systems development activities have become increasingly distributed across different <b>geographical</b> locations. Requirement <b>engineering</b> is an important and knowledge intensive phase {{in the development of}} information systems. Requirement engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing the requirements of a system. Effective and efficient knowledge sharing during the requirement engineering is vital for the successful development of information systems. However, the global distribution of the stakeholders has affected knowledge sharing during requirement engineering in various ways making it more challenging.   Drawing on the theories of knowledge sharing within the field of information systems, this interpretive research study aims at exploring stakeholders’ perceptions about the challenges met during the knowledge sharing in requirement engineering phase of globally distributed information systems development projects. More specifically, this Master thesis explores the perceived challenges and generates a list of suggestions to overcome the challenges by conducting qualitative semi-structured interviews among the key stakeholders, both customers and business analysts.   The findings indicate that the knowledge sharing is influenced by challenges such as cultural differences, language barriers, communication issues, coordination issues arising from multiple stakeholders, time difference and difficulty in sharing tacit knowledge in the globally distributed settings. Participants’ suggestions for overcoming these challenges include cultural trainings, kick off meetings, language trainings, use of translator, face-to-face communication and interaction, video conferencing, scheduling important meetings in the common suitable timings, identification of the main stakeholders, having a mediator and making close observations with face-to-face interactions.     Keywords:  Information Systems, Information Systems Development, Requirement Engineering, Knowledge Sharing, Global Distribution, Outsourcing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} an Advanced <b>Engineering</b> <b>Geographical</b> Information System (AEGIS) for the {{improved}} design of onshore pipelines, from concept to operation. The system is novel in that it is function rather than discipline or software specific. The thesis statement has been developed, and an aim and set of research objectives identified (along with the success criteria for the evaluation of the system), based on a review of current pipeline design methods. Drawing on a design science research methodology (DSRM), the thesis proposes the development of the system as an artefact in order to validate the proposed constructs, models, methods and implementations. The thesis discusses the underlying issues of data interoperability, the application of open data standards, and the integration of computer aided design (CAD) and geographical information systems (GIS). These challenges are addressed in the thesis and demonstrated through the implementation of the system. To support the development of the system, research was undertaken in the fields of pipeline engineering, environmental engineering and engineering design. As part of this research, a number of peer-reviewed journal papers were published, and conference papers presented in Kampala, Houston, London and Split. These papers covered the key fields contained in the thesis including, fluid mechanics, bio-systems engineering, environmental engineering, CAD/GIS integration (CGI), and the application and development of geospatial pipeline data models. The thesis concludes that the approach is valid, offering significant improvement across all fields compared to the current method of pipeline design. By taking a functional approach to the challenges of the design of pipelines, a system has been developed that addresses the requirements of the pipeline engineer, environmental engineer and engineering designer. The system enables the user to select the software of their choice, thereby reducing the problems associated with data interoperability, retraining and system integration. The sharing of data and outputs from analysis carried out within the system, provides an integrated approach, which can subsequently be used for the integrity management of the pipeline during the operational phase of the project. The scope for further development of this approach to pipeline design is also discussed. In addition to the inclusion of further engineering and environmental analysis, there is the potential for using the system for the design of subsea pipelines...|$|R
