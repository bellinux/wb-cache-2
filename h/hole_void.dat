The sensor field is decomposed into simply-connected pieces, inside each of which the sensor signal is homogeneous, i. e., the data flows uniformly from a local maximum to a local minimum. The Morse-Smale decomposition can be efficiently constructed in the network locally, after which applications such as iso-contour queries, data-guided navigation and routing, data aggregation, and topologically faithful signal reconstructions benefit tremendously from it.

40|$|Abstract. A brief {{review of}} the {{occurrence}} of amplitude modulated structures in space and labora-tory plasmas is provided, followed by a theoretical analysis of the mechanism of carrier wave (self-) interaction, with respect to electrostatic plasma modes. A generic collisionless unmagnetized fluid model is employed. Both cold – (zero-temperature) and warm – (finite temperature) fluid descriptions are considered and compared. The weakly nonlinear oscillation regime is investigated by applying a multiple scale (reductive perturbation) technique and a Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE) is obtained, describing {{the evolution of the}} slowly varying wave amplitude in time and space. The amplitude’s stability profile reveals the possibility of modulational instability to occur under the influence of external perturbations. The NLSE admits exact localized envelope (solitary wave) solu-tions of bright (pulses) or dark (<b>holes,</b> <b>voids)</b> type, whose characteristics depend on intrinsic plasma parameters.

30|$|Atomic-deficient {{evolution}} of glassy arsenic selenides is traced in subsequent nanostructurization stages ensuring their RE-doping functionality, the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy being employed to parameterize free-volume positron trapping sites within known two-state trapping model. The most efficient positron traps in parent As 2 Se 3 glass are imagined as voids with character free volumes of ~ 90  Å 3 formed in network of corner-shared AsSe 3 / 2 pyramids, composed of atomic-accessible geometrical <b>holes</b> (<b>void</b> cores) arrested by surrounding atomic-inaccessible Se-based bond-free solid angles (void shell). Under Ga-codoping in Ga 2 (As 0.40 Se 0.60) 98 glass, these voids grow in size, being essentially modified by their environment to become preferentially negative, thus serving as precursors for charge-compensating incorporation of electrically active rare-earth ions. Vitreous state stabilizing modification with Sb additives reduces outer free-volume shell of positron trapping sites mainly due to shielding effect from more metallic environment. The finalizing nanostructurization under Pr 3 +-doping (500  wppm) in Ga 2 (As 0.28 Sb 0.12 Se 0.60) 98 glass is {{explained in terms}} of competitive contribution of changed occupancy sites available for both rare-earth ions and positrons.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbundant {{evidence}} for the occurrence of modulated envelope plasma wave packets is provided by recent satellite missions. These excitations are characterized by a slowly varying localized envelope structure, embedding the fast carrier wave, {{which appears to be}} the result of strong modulation of the wave amplitude. This modulation may be due to parametric interactions between different modes or, simply, to the nonlinear (self-) interaction of the carrier wave.

Both cold (zero-temperature) and warm fluid descriptions are discussed and the results are compared.

All standard meanings of “largest” are supported, such as maximum area and maximum perimeter. This heuristic is extended to finding k rectangles whose union is largest. Furthermore, we present an extension of our method to 3 D, i. e., to computing inner approximations of polyhedra (possibly with <b>holes,</b> <b>voids</b> and cavities) by unions of (oriented) boxes.
