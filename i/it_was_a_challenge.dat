5|$|Jason Thompson, one of Viz's manga editors for series {{including}} Dragon Ball {{was selected}} as the magazine's first editor-in-chief. Initially, Viz hoped to have the magazine targeted to all age groups, however to allow for greater freedom on content, {{the decision was made to}} mark the magazine as being for readers 13 years of age and older. However, with greater attention being focused on manga as it became available in mainstream outlets, some titles were edited for content. Thompson noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> working with some of the artists whose works would appear in the first issue, who worried about excessive alterations.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to only be {{developing}} games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project {{that did not have}} the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{three women}} in the court focused their {{questioning}} on Hobby Lobby's lawyer, Paul Clement, while the men focused on the administration's lawyer, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. Justice Sotomayor quoted the ruling from United States v. Lee (1982) saying that an employer can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of religious beliefs. Clement replied that Lee does not apply because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> against a tax rather than against a significant burden. Sotomayor said that instead of paying {{the burden of the}} penalty, Hobby Lobby could replace its health care with the equivalent expense of higher wages and a calibrated tax, which the government would use to pay for the employees' health care. Near the end of Clement's argument, Justice Kennedy expressed concern for the rights of the employees who may not agree with the religious beliefs of their employers. When Verrilli argued that the ruling in Cutter v. Wilkinson requires the court to weigh the impact on third parties in every RFRA case, Justice Scalia said that the RFRA does not require the court to balance the interest of the religious objector to the interest of other individuals. Verilli returned to Lee, saying that granting an exemption to an employer should not impose the employer's religious faith on the employees.|$|E

Jackson {{expressed}} interest in appearing in the show as S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, his role from the MCU films, which led to his cameo appearance {{at the end of}} this episode. Executive producer Jeph Loeb said [...] "There were obviously a number of places that we thought Nick Fury would have a big impact on the show, but the more we talked about it, [...] to get him in very early, so that it would kind of christen the show, legitimize it in its own way."

500|$|John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez was the {{producer}} for the song, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for him, as previously he {{was associated with}} recording dance-pop songs only. Initially Warner Bros. Records {{did not want the}} song to be released as a single, since they believed that it would take away the attention from Madonna's second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). In the end, Peters and Guber convinced Warner officials to greenlight its release. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] ushered a new musical direction for Madonna, as [...] she had not previously released a ballad as a single. The track features instrumentation from snare drums, harp, bass synthesizer and electric guitar. Lyrically, the song speaks of sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos.|$|E

[...] In the end, the in-game model of Cate Archer was styled after model and actress Mitzi Martin. This was a marketing decision made by the publisher, Fox Interactive, which used its feature film casting department to look for an appropriate model internationally. Archer's voice was provided by American voice actress Kit Harris, who also did {{the voice of the}} Inge Wagner character. Originally, Harris recorded the Scottish protagonist's voice in a stronger Scottish accent. This was changed after a Scottish producer of the game felt that the particular accent used was too lower class, and an inappropriate choice; Harris re-recorded her lines with a [...] "British bent" [...] instead.

500|$|The {{sequences}} on the Grid were wholly shot in 3D, utilizing cameras {{specifically designed}} for it, and employed a 3D technique that combined other special effects techniques. The real-world sequences were filmed in 2D, and eventually altered using the three-dimensional element. Bailey stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> shooting Tron: Legacy in 3D because the cameras were bigger and heavier, and variations needed {{to be taken into}} account. Despite these concerns, he opined that it was a [...] "great reason {{to go to the movies}} because it's an experience you just can't recreate on an iPhone or a laptop". In some sequences the image shows a fine mesh pattern and some blurring. That is not interference or a production fault, but indicates that that sequence is a flashback and to simulate an older form of video representation technology. Stunt work on the film was designed and coordinated by 87Eleven, who also designed and trained fight sequences for 300 and Watchmen. Olivia Wilde described it as an honor to train with them.|$|E
500|$|Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin {{word meaning}} [...] "nobody". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main {{character}} of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is [...] "an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing." [...] Leto described his role saying, [...] "Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one {{all at the same}} time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to keep all these lives concentrated into one character {{for the duration of the}} filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things that helped me to keep track of where we were." [...] Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine.|$|E

As he progressed further, he began to see that the book would have very limited appeal, but equally he was convinced that it was a good book and the best work he had done. He was happy that it took his writing in a new direction and would confound the attempts of the critics to pigeonhole him, and, with a slightly masochistic joy he looked forward to their [...] "rage and contempt".

The trio posted their progress via their respective social media accounts during the recording, in the form of Snapchat and Instagram clips. All parties seemed satisfied with the record.

Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was my first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to see the two different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to kind of bring both of the worlds together.

To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation.
