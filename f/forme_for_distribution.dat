Since his encounter with American sculptor Mark di Suvero, in 1988, he has consistently cooperated with La Vie des <b>Formes</b> <b>for</b> the execution of monumental sculptures, notably in France and in New York. His technique, characterized by a strong determination to work without constraints, has led Meurdra to recommend the use of recycled materials.Georges Meurdra currently lives and works in France in Beaumont-lès-Valence.|$|R

5000|$|Most early {{methods of}} color {{printing}} involved several prints, {{one for each}} color, although there were various ways of printing two colors together if they were separate. Liturgical and many other kinds of books required rubrics, normally printed in red; these were long done by a separate print run with a red <b>forme</b> <b>for</b> each page. Other methods were used for single leaf prints. The chiaroscuro woodcut was a European method developed in the early 16th century, where to a normal woodcut block with a linear image (the [...] "line block"), one or more colored [...] "tone blocks" [...] printed in different colors would be added. This was the method developed in Germany; in Italy only tone blocks were often used, to create an effect more like a wash drawing. Jacob Christoph Le Blon developed a method using three intaglio plates, usually in mezzotint; these were overprinted to achieve {{a wide range of}} colors.|$|R

There were grand performances of The Creation and Messiah, and (in concert with Thalberg and Vieuxtemps) of Mozart's Requiem. Formes was an instant sensation. After Elijah in Boston, by 27 January 1858 the troupe was off to Philadelphia Academy, where Formes sang Plunkett (with Hugo Pickaneser), I puritani, Leporello, Bertram, and Elmiro in Otello with conductors Anschütz, D'Angri and Carl Bergmann. By late February Formes was back in New York for I puritani and Otello, and (8 March) his Marcel in Gli Ugonotti (Italian U.S. première).
