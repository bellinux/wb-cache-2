5|$|The MTO {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on 28 August 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie Drive to Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis Drive to <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> and the reconstruction of <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, York Region {{was moving}} forward with plans to expand <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> into a four lane road, while the {{province}} was urged to consider extending Highway404 north to it, and eventually around {{the east side of}} Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan called for an extension of Highway404 north to <b>Green</b> <b>Lane,</b> and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive outside town, to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E
5000|$|The Stamford Hill and <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> Turnpike Trust {{erected a}} toll gate on <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> by Duckett's Common, near Turnpike Lane in 1765. For the next 27 years {{this was the}} only {{tollgate}} on <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes,</b> at which time the Manor House toll gate was set up, along with others outside of the Harringay area. The turnpike system on <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> was abandoned in 1872. Photographs of both the [...] "Manor House" [...] and [...] "Duckett's Common" [...] turnpikes still exist today.|$|R
2500|$|Harringay [...] (pronounced [...] ) is a {{district}} of north London, England, within the London Borough of Haringey. It is centred on {{the section of}} <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> running between the New River, where it crosses <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> by Finsbury Park, and Duckett's Common, near Turnpike Lane.|$|R
25|$|A large {{section of}} {{the eastern side of}} <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> is called Grand Parade. Interrupted only by the gaps {{introduced}} by the residential roads running eastwards, Grand Parade runs for nearly half a kilometre from just north of Harringay <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> railway station to St Ann's Road.|$|R
5|$|Cheadle Hulme did {{not grow}} around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets {{that existed in}} the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, {{including}} Smithy <b>Green,</b> <b>Lane</b> End, Gill Bent, and Grove Lane. Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.|$|E
5|$|The Air Ministry {{placed an}} order in 1922 for {{the closure of}} the public {{footpath}} that ran through the site, providing £750 for the maintenance of nearby <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> where the path originated. The eventual order, dated 15 October 1924, replaced two previous orders from 1922 and 1923 which had required a replacement route, though no such route was established.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 {{the club}} {{required}} a larger ground {{and moved to}} Edgeley Park, then home of the rugby league club Stockport, who {{went out of business}} three years later. <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> was retained for use by the club's reserve team, and one further first team game was played at the ground on 18 April 1903 when Edgeley Park was being used by the rugby club. The site was later used for housing. Stockport County have played home games at Edgeley Park {{since the start of the}} 1902–03 season, celebrating the centenary in 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> {{had been}} {{established}} long before Domesday. In 1710 an Act of Parliament authorised {{the introduction of a}} turnpike on the road at Hornsey, although tolls were not levied until 1739. The Stamford Hill and <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> Turnpike Trust finally erected a toll gate on <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes</b> by Duckett's Common, near Turnpike Lane in 1765. For the next 27 years this was the only tollgate on <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes,</b> at which time the Manor House toll gate was set up, along with others outside of the Harringay area. The other main road through Harringay was along the route of present-day St Ann’s Road. Known for most of this period as Chisley <b>Lane,</b> it joined <b>Green</b> <b>Lanes,</b> Harringay to another of the great northbound roads out of London - Ermine Street or Tottenham High Road. Chisley Lane was a favoured haunt of the famous highwayman Dick Turpin. One further route developed prior to 1750 and is marked on Rocque's map of 1754. This shows a trackway leading from Hornsey to Hornseywood House. Some of this track follows the course of today’s Wightman Road.|$|R

5|$|Stockport County {{was formed}} in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers {{by members of the}} Wycliffe Congregational Church, and played their first {{recorded}} game in October the next year. The club adopted The Hatters as their nickname, owing to Stockport's history as the centre of the Victorian hat-making industry, a nickname that is shared with Luton Town. Stockport played in the Lancashire League until 1900, when they gained admission to the Football League Second Division. Stockport's first Football League match was against Leicester Fosse which ended in a 2–2 draw. Stockport left their <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> home in 1902 and moved to Edgeley Park where they currently reside.|$|E
5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion of the route to Newmarket in 1989; it would take over a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of the route to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E
5|$|Early garbage {{collection}} in Scarborough {{was performed by}} individual communities and dumped in local landfills which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 waste collection was reorganized. Local landfills were closed {{and most of the}} garbage was directed to a new landfill on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there garbage was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley landfill was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, garbage was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when garbage was sent to the new <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> landfill site in Elgin County.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{returned}} {{to search for}} the settlement that they believed was associated with the graves. There are examples elsewhere, such as at Garton <b>Green</b> <b>Lane</b> Crossing in the Yorkshire Wolds, of 7th-century graves associated with prehistoric monuments, and it was initially thought that the Street House graves were a similar example. However, the excavation uncovered another twelve graves. It was realised that the cemetery was far larger than first thought, so the following year an archaeological survey of the entire site was attempted. A total of 109 graves was found {{by the end of the}} 2007 dig, forming a complex monument laid out in a unique square fashion around a central mound, a bed burial and a building that had possibly served as a mortuary.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander <b>Green</b> <b>Lane.</b> The result was all the more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E
5|$|Other leisure {{facilities}} include the Keelman's Way, a 14-mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal {{from the various}} collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at Felling Shore, at <b>Green</b> <b>Lane,</b> is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally, {{and there are a}} wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest.|$|E
