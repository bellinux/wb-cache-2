When they asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{a look at}} the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His {{demeanor}} was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35p.m. Bryant's car was seen reversed up to the front door. It is assumed he unloaded ammunition.|$|E
25|$|All the congregations were {{established}} as independent denominations {{under the protection}} that the Dissenter Act provided, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> as few as six members. Following a movement inspired by the United States, there was a trend towards weak congregationalism. This established a common understanding of the legal and organizational independence of each congregation, while retaining {{the need for a}} national administrative and theological coordination. By the early 1870s the congregations in Skien, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø had largely taken on regional responsibilities and covered areas far exceeding the city limits.|$|E

25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs they score per innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs they score per innings – the true average number of runs they score per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> completed all their not out innings. If their scores have a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E
25|$|By 26 December 1745 Prince Charles's army were in Glasgow, {{and they}} {{departed}} {{from there on}} 3 January 1746. Charles and his army arrived in the neighbourhood of Stirling on 4 January with Charles making his headquarters at Bannockburn House which was the seat of Sir Hugh Paterson, and where he also was able make a closer acquaintance with Paterson’s niece Clementina Walkinshaw. Charles's military priority was now to seize Stirling Castle which commanded the high-arched Stirling Bridge which was the lowest permanent crossing of the River Forth. A British-Hanoverian commander, James Ray, stated that by capturing Stirling Castle, firstly it would give the Jacobites a reputation abroad {{as it is a}} famous place, secondly that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> also fortified Perth then it might have secured them the country for the winter and thirdly that it would have afforded them the means of maintaining themselves along the coasts, which would have facilitated their supplies from abroad.|$|E

The rescue work was difficult, as there is no road connection to the area and all materials have to be transported to the area by air. In addition, the mobile telephone and radio network was out. Representatives stated {{that it would have been}} easier <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> used the GSM-R network operated by the railway, which was functioning. The train, which consisted of a twin Class 73 electric multiple unit, burnt up and was destroyed in the fire. These cost [...] (€12.7M as of June 2011) each.

500|$|As December arrived, {{production}} was halted {{for a few}} days due to snowfall in New York City. Madonna decided to utilize the time by working on the film's soundtrack and her next concert tour. While recording the title track, Madonna decided to change the film's name from Slammer to Who's That Girl as she felt it to be a better title. Filming commenced in January 1987, where the scene involving a cougar was shot. During the second take, the cougar accidentally escaped from the cage, resulting in filming being paused for a few hours. By February 1987, Madonna's scenes were already shot although she proceeded to linger on the set to watch Foley and his team work. Foley described her being around the set and not acting as a [...] "pain-in-the-ass", since she [...] "wont skimp especially on cost and she should know that Warner had a tight schedule and constraints on the budget. They still did not trust Madonna when it came to acting. Hell they even gave a greater percentage of the budget to the soundtrack." [...] Filming ended in March 1987, with post-production continuing till July 1987. During the development of the starting credits, Madonna asked Foley <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a cartoon figure of her character introducing the film credits. Foley liked the idea, and Warner enlisted cartoonist April March to create the cartoon.|$|E

In the 1940s and early 1950s, it was noticed that some pastures of subterranean clover and red clover (phytoestrogen-rich plants) had adverse effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep.

[...] An investigation revealed that the ride derailed due to a broken axle. [...] None of the ride vehicle's axles had been replaced for fifteen years. [...] Following this accident, similar coasters at other Japanese parks were voluntarily shut down and inspected to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the same axle flaw. [...] Expoland was cited by authorities for faulty maintenance when similar axle cracks were found on a second train a month later. [...] On July 15, 2008, three former Expoland employees—the director and administrative manager, the head of facility and business department, {{and the head of}} the technical division—agreed with the allegation of professional negligence and violating Building Standards Law.

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the trial, various {{movements}} have arisen {{for the creation of a}} new law, called [...] "Caylee's Law", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child. One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures. In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York, and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of [...] "Caylee's Law". The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of12. The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> known the child would be in danger. The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being [...] "reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive". One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours. Additionally innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police.|$|E
