40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} and correcting for the magnetic field of a <b>dual</b> <b>spinning</b> spacecraft has been developed by employing {{an extension of the}} dual magnetometer technique of Ness et al.

The purpose of using a <b>dual</b> <b>spinning</b> spacecraft is to accommodate two types of instruments: (1) imaging and similar 'pointed' remote sensing systems on the stationary platform and (2) fields, particles, and other in situ measuring instruments on the spinning portion.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper by Wu [1] the three-point {{correlation}} of the q-state Potts model on a planar graph {{was related to}} ratios of dual partition functions under fixed boundary conditions. It was claimed that the method employed could straightforwardly be applied to higher correlations as well; this is however not true. By explicitly considering the four-point correlation we demonstrate how the appearence of non-well-nested connectivities invalidates the method. Consider the q-state Potts model [2] on a two-dimensional planar graph L having a free boundary. In accordance with Fig. 2 in Ref. [1] we let i, j, k and l be four sites on the boundary of L, following {{one another in a}} clockwise fashion, and we define exterior <b>dual</b> <b>spins</b> s 1, s 2, s 3 and s 4 so that all boundary spins between sites l and i of L interact with a spin state s 1, boundary spins between i and j interact with s 2, spins between j and k with s 3, and finally spins between k and l with s 4. The partition function with the four Potts spins σi, σj, σk and σl fixed in definite states is called Zσiσjσkσl, and similarly the dual partition function for fixed exterior <b>dual</b> <b>spins</b> is denoted by Z ∗ s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4.

On the contrary, asymmetric ZGNRs do not exhibit such a spin filter effect. By analyzing Wannier functions and a tight-binding model, we clarify that an interplay between the spin polarized band structure of π and π^* states near the Fermi level and decoupling of the interband hopping of the two states, arising from the symmetry of the wave functions, {{plays a crucial role}} in the effect.

40|$|Conventional giant {{magnetoresistance}} (GMR) in spin valves is current-independent, so {{the resistance of}} a device depends only on the relative orientation of the magnetic layers. In <b>dual</b> <b>spin</b> valves consisting of three ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by nonmagnetic (NM) spacers (i. e., a FM 1 /NM/FM 2 /NM/FM 1), GMR can be current-dependent if spin can accumulate in FM 2 when outer FM 1 layers are aligned antiparallel.

50|$|HCS {{instruments}} on {{the market}} today can be separated based on an array of specifications that significantly influence the instruments versatility and overall cost. These include speed, a live cell chamber that includes temperature and CO2 control (some also have humidity control for longer term live cell imaging), a built in pipettor or injector for fast kinetic assays, and additional imaging modes such as confocal, bright field, phase contrast and FRET. One of the most incisive difference is whether the instruments are optical confocal or not. Confocal microscopy summarizes as imaging/resolving a thin slice through an object and rejecting out of focus light that comes from outside this slice. Confocal imaging enables higher image signal to noise and higher resolution than the more commonly applied epi-fluorescence microscopy. Depending on the instrument confocality is achieved via laser scanning, a single spinning disk with pinholes or slits, a <b>dual</b> <b>spinning</b> disk, or a virtual slit.

Within the Slonczewski's approach, an analytical expression of the torque on the free magnetic layer is obtained, which may serve as a theoretical model for the micromagnetic simulation of the spin dynamics in <b>dual</b> <b>spin</b> valve.

In this process a polymer solution {{in the form of}} a thin liquid film or hollow fiber is immersed in a nonsolvent bath where the polymer precipitates and forms a membrane. The immersion precipitation process can be performed by various means. The <b>dual</b> bath <b>spinning</b> process is one specific way which can be used, e. g., for the preparation of hollow fiber membranes for gas separation. In this process hollow fibers are spun by contacting the polymer solution with two properly chosen coagulents successively. The first coagulant is used to 'extract' solvent out of the polymer solution. The contact time is short in order to create a thin layer of high polymer concentration at the interface. The second coagulent is used to quickly precipitate the polymer solution to form the membrane. With this spinning process, hollow fibers with the intrinsic selectivity of the polymer material can be easily obtained without the necessity of coating.
