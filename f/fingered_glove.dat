50|$|As mentioned, Landmates {{have four}} arms. The two large ones {{are used for}} {{carrying}} items, frequently large weapons, and employ jointed, five-fingered mechanical hands. The two smaller arms, located below the first pair, are hollow and flexible sheaths, that contain the pilot's arms. Most military and police Landmates have a lightly armored, <b>fingered</b> <b>glove</b> {{at the end of}} the control arms, allowing the pilot to use their own hand for special purposes or weapons handling, whereas civilian models typically have a protective steel mitt.|$|E

50|$|Gloves {{are worn}} by {{all members of}} the {{defensive}} team and are made in many styles and sizes. The gloves are made with leather or a sturdy fabric. The catcher and first baseman usually wear mitts which include additional padding and no <b>fingers.</b> <b>Gloves</b> are similar to baseball gloves, but softball allows larger sizes up to 14 inches from top to bottom.|$|R
50|$|These gloves {{are also}} {{referred}} as short <b>finger</b> <b>gloves,</b> {{are used for}} better grip by exposing fingers. It gives you the dexterity needed when grabbing hold of bars. Very useful in hot and humid conditions to avoid sweating in hands. They are the second most used gym gloves. They also make the bare metal of the weight bars easier on the skin.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>Gloves</b> is a {{performance}} piece {{and the main}} prop of that performance piece and was done in 1972. They are worn like <b>gloves,</b> but the <b>finger</b> form extends with balsa wood and cloth. By {{being able to see}} what she was touching {{and the way in which}} she was touching it, it felt as if her fingers were extended and in her mind the illusion was created that she was actually touching what the extensions were touching. There is another piece that she did that is very similar to this one. It is part of her Berlin Exercises series done in 1974 called [...] "touching the walls with both hands simultaneously". In this piece she made more <b>finger</b> extension <b>gloves,</b> but this time measured it so that they specifically fit the selected space. If the chosen participant stood in the middle of the room, they could exactly touch opposing walls simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Full <b>fingered</b> - <b>Gloves</b> should fit snugly but not be tight. Pay {{particular}} attention to the length of the fingers as the fingertips can become very cold if the <b>glove's</b> <b>fingers</b> are not long enough. Ideally the glove should be loose on the fingers and fit comfortably around the palm. A tight glove will tend to restrict blood flow and make the hand cold as it is at an extreme distance from the heart.|$|R

5000|$|Marionettes, or [...] "string puppets," [...] are {{suspended}} {{and controlled by}} a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer. The control bar can be either horizontal or vertical. Basic strings for operation are usually attached to the head, back, hands (to control the arms) and just above the knee (to control the legs). This form of puppetry is complex and sophisticated to operate, requiring greater manipulative control than a <b>finger,</b> <b>glove</b> or rod puppet. The puppet play performed by the Von Trapp children with Maria in The Sound of Music is a marionette show.|$|R
50|$|An {{infrared}} touchscreen uses {{an array}} of X-Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs {{around the edges of}} the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a <b>finger,</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>finger,</b> stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and point of sale systems which can not rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike capacitive touchscreens, infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt/dust that can interfere with the IR beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers his/her finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.|$|R

Ideally the glove should be loose on the fingers and fit comfortably around the palm. A tight glove will tend to restrict blood flow and make the hand cold. In very cold weather it is often advisable to follow the skier's practice of thin inner gloves and outer padded waterproof mittens. Silk inner gloves are exceptionally warm and can usually be sourced from mountaineering and other outdoor sports shops.Most of professional cyclists use half <b>finger</b> cycling <b>gloves.</b>|$|R

40|$|Effective strata control, utilising fully {{encapsulated}} {{roof bolts}} {{is dependent on}} the installed quality of the reinforcement elements. One mechanism by which roof bolts may become less than fully efficient is by <b>glove</b> <b>fingering</b> (<b>gloving)</b> and un-mixing of the resin. Following a routine installed bolt quality audit and some small roof failures containing gloved bolts, a work programme was initiated {{to determine the extent of}} the gloving and un-mixing problem and to develop an understanding of mechanisms involved. Results have shown that gloving and un-mixing is a systematic and widespread pheno mena, occurring across the range of resin and/or bolt manufacturers, and in a variety of roof types. Gloving was found in bolts installed using either hand held pneumatic or continuous miner mounted hydraulic bolting rigs, under run of mine (ROM) condition s by operators, and under controlled manufactures “best practice” conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an evaluation {{and recommendations for}} the improvement of the user interface (UI) of medical exoskeleton robots for people with mobility disorders. Existing UIs of currently available medical exoskeletons lack the flexibility to serve a diverse user group who require more customization. A UI prototype consisting of a glove with buttons attached on fingertips, and a display module for user feedback and/or instruction was developed and evaluated. For the evaluation of this UI prototype, multiple usability tests, guerrilla tests, interviews, and surveys were conducted with several crutch and manual wheelchair users. Finally, a set of final Glove UI design recommendations is illustrated based on the test subjects and interviewees’ feedback; <b>finger</b> <b>glove,</b> two buttons, singleton walking method, and adjustable display position. A more thorough evaluation on this improved UI with more potential users of medical exoskeletons with various physical abilities remains as future work.
