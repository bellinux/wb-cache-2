5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

He {{received}} answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too busy for art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city.|$|E

Our experimental {{evidence suggests that}} many people do not find this task easy. This paper considers evidence from more than 100 participants in a ‘payment-by-results’ experiment. The {{subjects were asked to}} place certainty equivalent valuations on some simple gambles, after having made a short series of choices in the vicinity of those valuations. At each decision point they were asked to record <b>how</b> confident <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> these decisions.

While post-semester surveys and demographic participation data can highlight who was involved and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> subsequently <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the experience, these techniques do not necessarily reflect real-time engagement. One way to gain insight into in-situ student experiences is by categorising the original posts and comments into predetermined frameworks of learning.

500|$|Experience {{designer}} Bob Rogers and {{the design}} team BRC Imagination Arts, were commissioned to create the new post show experience entitled: [...] "The Assembly Experience." [...] The Assembly Experience is a walk-through environment, giving guest the illusion that {{they are on the}} floor of a vast automotive assembly plant. [...] Automotive doors, seats and engines glide overhead on assembly line chainveyors, while simulated automotive die-press caused the floor to [...] "rumble" [...] as each automotive part was pressed.

500|$|David Crane and Marta Kauffman began {{developing}} {{three new}} television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about [...] "six {{people in their}} 20s making their way in Manhattan" [...] to NBC, since {{they thought it would}} fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking {{at a time when the}} future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> their own lives at the time. The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{was made by}} fashion film {{director}} Ruth Hogben in collaboration with West, who appears in a cameo in the video. The video was shot {{during the summer of}} 2011 during a two-day shoot. Hogben and West had brainstorming sessions deciding what the video was going to be conceptually, finally deciding something that would aesthetically fit the song the best. About collaborating with West, Hogben commented that the process was very organic and creative in nature, musing that the two went back and forth with ideas for visuals. The dancers in the video were not instructed to dance in any particular way by Yemi A.D. {{who was in charge of}} the dance choreography; and according to Ruth Hogben, they [...] "wanted an interpretation of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the song to be portrayed instead." [...] The video was eventually released May 4, 2012. The video was described as [...] "belated" [...] because it was premiered nearly a year and a half after the initial release of the album [...] "Lost in the World" [...] accompanies.|$|E
50|$|Within a {{month of}} {{arriving}} in Wellington, Wakefield began a campaign in London to have him recalled not knowing he had already applied to leave the colony. Meanwhile, Grey was in control. He responded to the attacks on him by questioning Wakefield's integrity, always an easy target. Particularly he focussed on the generous fees that had been paid to Wakefield as a Director of the New Zealand Company {{at a time when}} it was reneging on its debts in New Zealand. This served to remind the people of Wellington just <b>how</b> badly <b>they</b> had been let down by the Company and <b>how</b> angry <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it. Wakefield managed to clear himself of the actual charges, but a great deal of dirt was thrown around.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least two}} scripts were rejected, {{as they did}} not feel {{in keeping with the}} show. Meriwether {{recalled}} that one storyline had Prince playing the lead singer of a Prince cover band. She also said that Prince's appearance with the characters needed to be believable. Eventually the writers, Rob Rosell and Dave Feeney, scripted an episode that would see the characters attending a party at Prince's house, where he would help Jess and Nick say [...] "I love you" [...] for the first time. In a piece for Vulture, Meriwether recalled that Prince was pleased that he got to be the person who would help get Jess and Nick to admit <b>how</b> <b>they</b> truly <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> each other.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} is reported {{in which participants}} were asked to record <b>how</b> confident <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the correctness of their responses as they assessed the validity of deductive arguments whose conclusions varied in prior believability. The results showed that participants were more confident of their responses to valid problems than invalid problems irrespective of believability status, providing support for the idea that invalid problems are more demanding to process than valid problems. Effects of belief, logic on conclusion acceptance rates and a logicxbelief interaction are also demonstrated, and evidence is provided to suggest that belief bias principally reflects a tendency to reject unbelievable arguments. A theory is proposed in which belief bias effects are accounted for by the variations in the processing demands of valid and invalid syllogisms...|$|R
500|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, Bowlby advised that parents should be {{supported}} by society as parents are dependent on a greater society for economic provision and [...] "if a community values its children it must cherish its parents". Also [...] "husbandless" [...] mothers of children under 3 should be supported {{to care for the}} child at home rather than the child be left in inadequate care whilst the mother sought work. (It was assumed the mother of the illegitimate child would usually be left with the child). Fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without the mother should be provided with [...] "housekeepers" [...] so that the children could remain at home. Other proposals included the proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers, and frank, informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it rather than the [...] "least said, soonest mended" [...] approach. The point that children were loyal to and loved even the worst of parents, and needed to have that fact understood non-judgementally, was strongly made.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage. [...] Adolescents were asked <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> oral and vaginal sex {{in relation to}} their health, social, and emotional well-being. [...] Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic. Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|E
2500|$|In February1989, {{a student}} named [...] "Dread" [...] Scott Tyler draped the Flag of the United States {{across the floor}} for a piece titled What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag? The piece {{consisted}} of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans. The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{the prime}} Minister Apollo Milton Obote changed the 1966 {{constitution}} {{and turned the}} state into a republic. On 24 May 1966 the federal Ugandan army attacked the royal compound or Lubiri in Mmengo. They shelled the palace with the king Mutesa II trapped inside. The king fought {{his way out of}} the burning building and with the assistance of the priests at a seminary in Lubaga escaped Uganda and found exile in London where he died in mysterious circumstances (blamed on alcohol poisoning) three years later. The Ugandan army turned the king's palace into their barracks and the Buganda parliament building into their headquarters. It was difficult to know how many Baganda continued to support the kingship and <b>how</b> intensely <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it because no one could express support openly.|$|R

When asked if they thought the death penalty was generally fair and free of error in California, 58% agreed and 32% disagreed (11% offered no opinion). When the results were broken down along ethnicity, of the people who identified themselves as African American, 57% disagreed that the death penalty was fair and free of error.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} result of a survey {{designed}} to investigate the degree of uncertainty by which a representative sample of Swedish households hold their perceptions and expectations of inflation. The public displays hardly any uncertainty concerning the direction of change of the price level as measured by the ratio of ‘don't know’ answers. However, when asked for numerical estimates of the perceived and expected rate of inflation, uncertainty increases considerably. The ratio of ‘don't know’ answers is now about 45 per cent. Respondents giving numerical measures were asked to rank <b>how</b> certain <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> their answers. The majority of them <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were ‘rather certain’. A major difference in certainty was found between men and women. No major differences existed across age, place of living and education.

2500|$|Reeves and Nass {{designed}} {{an experiment}} in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At {{the end of the}} session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspended}} Sierra then {{contacted the}} American Civil Liberties Union, {{who agreed to}} take up her cause. The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "his isn't something funny or cute…ou're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy.|$|E

5000|$|Hip hop plays a huge role {{into this}} {{identity}} crisis. Young Filipino Americans are affected {{mostly because of}} this {{because of all the}} racial comments they get from people. Hip-Hop has been put out there originating from African Americans rapping about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were oppressed, or <b>how</b> <b>they</b> have been segregated for too long. Filipino Americans also used this as an outlet to talk about their issues with society. In the book [...] "Writer in Exile/Writer in Revolt: Critical Perspectives on Carlos Bulosan" [...] Viola talks about how Hip-Hop in general talks about the movements that has been made, it replicates the feelings that people had, <b>how</b> strongly <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> what mattered to them the most. Hip-Hop is this form of expression that put what people wanted to fight for in a form of expression where everybody and anybody could listen to it. Filipino Americans also used Hip-hop to talk about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are present now, that we {{are not the same as}} every Asian American, there are many different races and ethnicities and we have different backgrounds, different cultures than the different races.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} the faces of others has been significant throughout human history. The in-group and out-group bias show that humans remember more faces of people in their own group in most circumstances. This study focused on gender of perceiver and target effects in recognition when faces vary in attractiveness. There were 15 white male and 15 white female participants who engaged in a facial recognition task with a manipulation of target attractiveness. This consisted of the participant encoding 15 male and 15 female computer generated faces for future recognition. The participants saw the same 30 faces randomly mixed with 15 new male and 15 new female faces making a total of 60 faces. They were asked to recognize the faces that they saw in the first set and rate <b>how</b> confident <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> their answers. The faces used ranged from highly attractive, average, and highly unattractive for {{both male and female}} faces. The findings supported the hypothesis that the more attractive or unattractive the faces, the more they will be remembered. Also the findings showed a gender difference in the recognition of faces of the same and other gender...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that nostalgia is a highly social emotion that provides a sense of social connectedness. In the present research, we tested a social motivational function of nostalgia. Specifically, across 7 studies we found converging evidence that nostalgia mobilizes social goals. In Study 1, nostalgia increased the importance people assigned to relationship goals and <b>how</b> optimistic <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> achieving these goals. In Study 2, nostalgia increased intentions to pursue goals of connecting with friends. In Study 3, experimentally-induced pessimism about achieving relationship goals instigated nostalgia. In Study 4, we found evidence that it is the interpersonal nature of nostalgia that is associated with striving to connect with others. Specifically, nostalgia about aspects of the past that were high in sociality was associated with intentions to interact with others, whereas nostalgia for aspects of the past that were low in sociality was not. In Study 5, nostalgic reflection increased friendship-approach goal striving relative to reflecting on ordinary social memories, but did not increase friendship-avoidant goal striving. Finally, in Studies 6 and 7, we found evidence that social-efficacy mediated the effect of nostalgia on striving to connect with others and striving to overcome interpersonal challenges. Together, these findings establish nostalgia as catalyst for social goal pursuit and growth...|$|R

40|$|Decision aids in North American {{breast cancer}} outpatients {{have been shown}} to assist with {{treatment}} decision making and reduce decisional conflict. To date, appropriate delivery formats to effectively increase patient participation in newly diagnosed breast cancer inpatients have not been investigated in the context of German health care provision. The impact of a decision aid intervention was studied in patients (n= 111) with a strong suspicion of breast cancer in a randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome variable was decisional conflict. Participants were followed up 1 week post-intervention with a retention rate of 92 %. Analyses revealed that the intervention group felt better informed (ηp 2 = 0. 06) but did not experience an overall reduction in decisional conflict as compared with the control group. The intervention had no effect on uptake rates of treatment options, length of consultation with the surgeon, time point of treatment decision making, perceived involvement in decision making, neither decision related nor general patient satisfaction. Patients who received the decision aid intervention experienced a small benefit with regards to <b>how</b> informed <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> advantages and disadvantages of relevant treatment options.

5000|$|Psychological {{well-being}} (PWB) {{is defined}} as “the overall effectiveness of an individual’s psychological functioning” as related to primary facets of one’s life: work, family, community, etc. [...] There are three defining characteristics of PWB.

Particularly, psychologically well people {{are more prone to}} experience positive emotions and less prone to experience negative emotions. Third, well-being refers to one's life as a whole. It is a global evaluation. [...] PWB is primarily measured using the eight-item Index of Psychological Well-Being developed by Berkman (IPWB).
