5|$|Autonomic effects: shivering, sweating, <b>hyperthermia,</b> vasoconstriction, tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|Labradors often {{suffer from}} {{exercise}} induced collapse, a syndrome that causes <b>hyperthermia,</b> weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, <b>hyperthermia</b> and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, <b>hyperthermia,</b> serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant <b>hyperthermia,</b> anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for <b>hyperthermia</b> {{includes}} reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{treatment}} for some symptoms may be required. One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and <b>hyperthermia.</b> If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or <b>hyperthermia.</b> The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of <b>hyperthermia.</b> Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperthermia</b> is {{an example}} of a high {{temperature}} that is not a fever. It occurs from a number of causes including heatstroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant <b>hyperthermia,</b> stimulants such as substituted amphetamines and cocaine, idiosyncratic drug reactions, and serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The current {{treatment}} of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting <b>hyperthermia,</b> acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the Malignant <b>Hyperthermia</b> Association of the United States (MHAUS) hotline was {{established}} to provide telephone support to clinical teams treating patients with suspected malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b> The hotline became active in 1982 and since that time MHAUS has provided continuous access to board certified anesthesiologists to assist teams in treatment.|$|E
25|$|Other animals, {{including}} certain pig breeds, dogs, and horses, {{are susceptible}} to malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{stimulant}} drugs, including amphetamines, cocaine, PCP, LSD, and MDMA {{can produce}} <b>hyperthermia</b> as an adverse effect.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal filters {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} an {{anesthesia}} machine in less than 60 seconds for people at risk of malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b> These filters prevent residual anesthetic from triggering malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> for up to 12 hours, even at low fresh gas flows. Prior to placing the charcoal filters, the machine should be flushed with fresh gas flows greater than 10 L/min for 90 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, <b>hyperthermia</b> {{occurs when}} the body {{temperature}} rises without {{a change in the}} heat control centers.|$|E
25|$|At doses over 30â€“40mg {{the user}} may {{experience}} frightening hallucinations, {{as well as}} tachycardia, hypertension, and <b>hyperthermia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Combined {{modality}} chemotherapy {{is the use}} {{of drugs}} with other cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or <b>hyperthermia</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|If fever-reducing drugs {{lower the}} body {{temperature}}, {{even if the}} temperature does not return entirely to normal, then <b>hyperthermia</b> is excluded.|$|E
25|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that some individuals with malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.|$|E
25|$|Malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> is a {{disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|The last {{variable}} is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called <b>hyperthermia,</b> and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia. Slight <b>hyperthermia</b> results in increasing HR {{and strength of}} contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patientâ€™s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the bodyâ€™s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive <b>hyperthermia</b> and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|A fever can {{be caused}} by many medical {{conditions}} ranging from not serious to potentially serious. This includes viral, bacterial and parasitic infections such as the common cold, urinary tract infections, meningitis, malaria and appendicitis among others. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, side effects of medication, and cancer among others. It differs from <b>hyperthermia,</b> in that <b>hyperthermia</b> is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set-point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.|$|E
25|$|After investigation, some {{of these}} infant deaths {{are found to be}} caused by {{accidental}} suffocation, <b>hyperthermia</b> or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic <b>hyperthermia</b> {{makes use}} of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles, which can be injected into tumours and then generate heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Sauna or steam-bath: Medical opinion holds {{this may}} be dangerous, as the {{combination}} of alcohol and <b>hyperthermia</b> {{increases the likelihood of}} dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperthermia</b> {{can also}} be {{deliberately}} induced using drugs or medical devices and is being studied and applied in clinical routine as a treatment of some kinds of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) 14 days or less prior to {{treatment}} with tianeptine. Due {{to the potential}} for cardiovascular effects (including hypertension and cardiovascular collapse), convulsions, <b>hyperthermia</b> (high body temperature) and death.|$|E
25|$|Drugs that {{decouple}} {{oxidative phosphorylation}} may also cause <b>hyperthermia.</b> From {{this group of}} drugs the most well known is 2,4-Dinitrophenol which {{was used as a}} weight loss drug until dangers from its use became apparent.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} PPE on <b>hyperthermia</b> {{has been noted}} in {{fighting}} the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa. Doctors and healthcare workers were only able to work 40 minutes at a stretch in their protective suits, fearing heat strokes.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} ephedra {{consumption}} may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and <b>hyperthermia.</b> More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.|$|E
25|$|Exercise fatigue {{has also}} been {{attributed}} to the direct effects of exercise upon the brain such as increased cerebral levels of serotonin, reduced level of glutamate secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain, brain <b>hyperthermia,</b> and glycogen depletion in brain cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{anesthetic}} use of chloroform {{has been}} discontinued because it caused deaths due to respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Following chloroform-induced anesthesia, some patients suffered nausea, vomiting, <b>hyperthermia,</b> jaundice, and coma due to hepatic dysfunction. At autopsy, liver necrosis and degeneration have been observed.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, {{as well as of}} developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real timeâ€”heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic <b>hyperthermia</b> or magnetic fluid <b>hyperthermia</b> method, it will be easier to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} bentazon {{ingestion}} {{has been observed}} in humans who chose the herbicide to commit suicide. Ingestion of bentazon was observed to cause fevers, renal failure (kidney failure), accelerated heart rate (tachycardia), shortness of breath (dyspnea) and <b>hyperthermia.</b> Ingestion of 88 grams of bentazon caused death in an adult.|$|E
25|$|Malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b> A causative mutated allele, ryanodine {{receptor}} 1 gene (RyR1) at nucleotide C7360G, {{generating a}} R2454G amino acid substitution. {{has been identified}} in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry, inherited as an autosomal dominant It {{can be caused by}} overwork, anesthesia, or stress.|$|E
25|$|Malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> (MH) {{is a type}} {{of severe}} {{reaction}} that occurs to particular medications used during general anesthesia, among those who are susceptible. Symptoms include muscle rigidity, high fever, and a fast heart rate. Complications can include rhabdomyolysis and high blood potassium. Most people who are susceptible are generally otherwise normal when not exposed.|$|E
