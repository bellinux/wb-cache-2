A fight with his older brother, Buzz, results in Kevin getting sent to {{the third floor of the}} house for punishment, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes a temporary power outage and resets the alarm clocks, causing the entire family to oversleep.

50|$|The heist {{itself is}} {{comparatively}} straightforward and easy, but the getaway {{turns into a}} nightmare. The relatively simple act of <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> catch a flight {{out of the country}} is {{complicated by the fact that}} fate, luck and all of New York City appears to be conspiring against their escape.|$|R
2500|$|At 06:00 on April 29, General Dung {{was ordered}} by the Politburo to [...] "strike with the {{greatest}} determination straight into the enemy's final lair." [...] At the same time, there were still many Air America aircraft at Tan Son Nhat. Shortly after 7:35 the many UH-1 Hueys began their shuttles from the many rooftop pads around town out to the U.S. Navy ships offshore. The fixed-wing aircraft each had assigned pilots, but due to the confusion, many pilots could not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> Captain E. G. Adams was assigned to pilot a Volpar Beech {{but when he was}} the last pilot on the Air America ramp (all other personnel had gone over to the MACV HQ), and there was a C-46 aircraft full of refugees parked there, Adams boarded that aircraft (a 52-passenger configured ship with 152 people on board) and departed on it, so it thus became the last fixed-wing aircraft to depart Saigon during the evacuation, dodging the burning aircraft on the Main Ramp and on Runway 36.|$|E

50|$|Bus number 32 connects <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> with bus and tram stop Thon. Since December 2015 {{new line}} 33 was installed, {{allowing}} passengers from Nurembergs west-neighbouring city Fürth <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> quicker {{without taking a}} detour via Nuremberg Central Station.

50|$|Zhanjiang Economic and Technological Development Zone {{was founded}} in 1984. Its total planned area is 9.2 km2. The zone {{has a very good}} {{location}} for transportation.

The major industries in the zone including automobile assembly, biotechnology and computer software.|$|E
30|$|However, it is {{important}} to be aware that network restructuring may weaken the passenger basis for the current hub- and spoke system, and present passengers with a longer average transport distance to reach their local <b>airport.</b> <b>The</b> closure of regional airports could impose reduced transport standard for some passengers, due to increased travel costs <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> at least in the short run. This may especially be the case for passengers with high time costs living close <b>to</b> a discontinued <b>airport.</b> <b>The</b> reduced operating costs and costs for PSO-operations can be spent on further improvements in the road infrastructure in the region losing its airport and thereby raising the transport standard for both air transport passengers and other road users.|$|R

50|$|From Natori Station, service extends via the Tōhoku Main Line {{tracks to}} Sendai Station, a {{stop for the}} Tōhoku Shinkansen express trains located in central Sendai. From Sendai Station, it takes 17 minutes (rapid service) or 25 minutes (local service) to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> The railway also has advertised that Sendai Airport can be reached from {{neighboring}} cities such as Fukushima and Ichinoseki in under one hour.|$|E
30|$|Another {{difference}} between passenger air alliances and ocean carrier alliances is people versus things; {{for the air}} industry, the customer is the cargo; for ships, the BCO, NVOCC or cargo user. For customers, air service starts with <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> and ends after discharge, baggage handling, {{and to some extent}} transport to destination. Ocean container service is much more heavily dependent on what happens after the cargo gets ashore. While the voyage itself may take the most time, shore side activities, including handling and travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cargo destination, present many more chances for delay, and a wide range of partners <b>to</b> coordinate. <b>The</b> increased chance for service failure reflects badly on the carriers, alliances and overseas transit intermediaries, as well as the onshore carriers and facilities. Greater integration of these onshore components, beyond the port and its environs, is needed to meet customer service for ocean carriage, as opposed to air carriage of passengers.|$|R
50|$|Passengers can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{and from}} <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> by car or taxi. ML-204 {{is the main}} road {{accessing}} <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> and connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. ML-300 provides access to areas outside of the city.|$|R

50|$|In 1951: Eastern Airlines Flight 601 bound from Newark to Miami {{suffered}} severe buffeting {{after an}} access door opened in flight over Lynchburg, Virginia {{and the crew}} decided to divert to Richmond. A flapless wheels-up landing was made a few miles short of the runway at Curles Neck Farm because the crew feared that the aircraft would disintegrate before they could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to attempt an emergency landing. There were no fatalities.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airport</b> {{is located}} on the paved road that connects Hadibo on the {{northern}} coast with the main tourist attraction on the extreme west of the island, Qalansiyah beach. It takes about two hours <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> Qalansiyah.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> loop {{was planned}} and built {{as part of}} the Cologne-Frankfurt {{high-speed}} line, few trains run along both lines. The main mode of transport on <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> loop is S-Bahn line S13 between Cologne and Troisdorf with 58 pairs of trains on weekdays. <b>The</b> connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south is served very poorly.The Regional-Express line RE 8 operates over <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> loop every hour. However, the first train from the south reaches <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> after 7 AM and on Sundays, after 10 AM. <b>Getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> earlier than this from Bonn and Koblenz is only possible on significantly slower indirect services. Most of the hourly Intercity-Express services between Cologne and Berlin start or stop at <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> station. This creates operational problems, as <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> station was planned as a through station only and no turning facilities were built. Since the station has limited facilities, the terminating ICE trains take up platform space properly reserved for S-Bahn trains. As a result, two thirds of the S-Bahn trains operating towards Cologne must use the outer platform, with the low platforms designed in Germany for long-distance trains, twenty centimetres lower than appropriate for S-Bahn trains, thus creating a step between the platform and the carriage floor.|$|R
50|$|The crew quickly {{recognized}} {{that they did}} not have the thrust anymore necessary <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> and attempted an off-airport landing. A taxi driver just fueling his car at the nearby petrol station said that the airplane hit the wires along the highway triggering sparks, before it impacted ground. The aircraft crashed at 03:57 local time. It skimmed over trees and crash landed, skidded along the field and slammed into a ranch house, killing 2 people, Pedro Suarez, 50, and his 13-year-old son Edwin. The aircraft then broke up into several sections.|$|R
