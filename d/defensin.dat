In general, defensins have commonalities in their molecular structure, such as cysteines in the peptide stabilized with disulfide bonds. In particular, defensins from P.nigrella, invertebrates, and plants and share a conformation that has been named the CSαβ motif. [...] In laboratory tests, plectasin was especially active in inhibiting {{the growth of the}} common human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. Plectasin has a low toxicity in mice, and cured them of peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S.pneumoniae as efficiently as vancomycin and penicillin, suggesting that it may have therapeutic potential. In 2010, Chinese scientists announced a method for high-level production of plectasin using an E.coli protein expression system.|$|E

40|$|Human {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes (PMN) contain three antimicrobial and cytotoxic peptides which {{belong to}} a family of mammalian granulocyte peptides named <b>defensins.</b> To determine their potential availability for extracellular microbicidal or cytotoxic events, we quantified the extracellular release of <b>defensins</b> after stimulation of human PMN with phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan. As determined by enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry, 10 (6) human PMN contained 4 to 5 micrograms of <b>defensins.</b> After stimulation with {{a high concentration of}} phorbol myristate acetate (1 microgram/ml), about 8 % of PMN <b>defensins</b> were found in the media.

50|$|<b>Defensins</b> are {{produced}} constitutively and/or {{in response to}} microbial products or proinflammatory cytokines. Some <b>defensins</b> are also called corticostatins (CS) because they inhibit corticotropin-stimulated corticosteroid production. The mechanism(s) by which microorganisms are killed and/or inactivated by <b>defensins</b> is not understood completely. However, it is generally believed that killing {{is a consequence of}} disruption of the microbial membrane. The polar topology of <b>defensins,</b> with spatially separated charged and hydrophobic regions, allows them to insert themselves into the phospholipid membranes so that their hydrophobic regions are buried within the lipid membrane interior and their charged (mostly cationic) regions interact with anionic phospholipid head groups and water. Subsequently, some <b>defensins</b> can aggregate to form 'channel-like' pores; others might bind to and cover the microbial membrane in a 'carpet-like' manner. The net outcome is the disruption of membrane integrity and function, which ultimately leads to the lysis of microorganisms. Some <b>defensins</b> are synthesized as propeptides which may be relevant to this process. Alpha <b>defensins</b> of the mouse bowel were historically called cryptdins when first discovered.|$|R

Methods: Oral examinations were performed on 100 adults of both genders (18 - 30 years old), and unstimulated whole saliva was collected for immunoassays of the three peptides and for the salivary pH, buffercapacity, protein, and peroxidase activity. mRNA levels of <b>defensins</b> in gingival sample were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. Results: The median salivary levels of hBD 2 and hBD 4 were 1. 88 μg/ml and 0. 86 μg/ml respectively for the caries-free group (n= 44) and 7. 26 μ/ml (hBD 2) and 4. 25 μg/ml (hBD 4) for all subjects with evidenceof caries (n= 56). There was no difference in the levels of hNP 4, salivary pH, and proteins between groups, however the peroxidase activity and buffer capacity (interval 6. 0 - 5. 0) were reduced in caries group. Transcriptional levels of hBD 2 and hBD 4 did correlate with caries experience, the mRNA expression of hBD 2 and hBD 4 were signifi cantly higher in patients with caries than in patients with no-caries (p < 0. 01).
