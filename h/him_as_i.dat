5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

[...] And then, as he still seemed slightly at sea: [...] "The man who had succeeded with ME, don't you see? For her to get him from me was such an added incentive." ...|$|R

500|$|In late 1891 Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, {{was engaged}} to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. [...] "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, [...] "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, [...] " [...] have given my life for <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> put no value on mine". Albert Victor was the second of Edward's {{children}} to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with [...] "the tears rolling down his cheeks".|$|E
500|$|Pauline was grief-stricken {{and later}} said [...] "My poor little boy. If only I {{had been with}} him...I would have nursed <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> nursed his father". She came to blame Borghese for his {{decision}} to send Dermide to Frascati and called him [...] "the butcher of my son", believing that, {{had it not been}} for her husband, her son [...] "would still be alive". Leclerc's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide, leaving him to die under the care of servants, when she could have left him in France, to live with them. Nonetheless, Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert, next to General Leclerc. Dermide's inheritance reverted to his father's family and, in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert, Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

500|$|The same {{search for}} direct intuition and {{understanding}} {{can be seen}} with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to [...] "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God." [...] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come [...] "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) {{and asked if he}} had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said [...] "My boy, you have the Yogis eyes." [...] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying [...] "Yes, I see <b>Him</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense." [...] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.|$|E

The Delegation of 2000 is primarily concerned with Palpatine's calls for public surveillance and restrictions on freedom of movement and action. Still, Padmé is confident Palpatine will relinquish his power when the crisis is over: [...] "He's not stubborn," [...] she tells Bail Organa. [...] "You just don't know <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do. He'll take our concerns to heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Child {{maintains}} that the only proof that Putnam was at the redoubt during the action is letter written by John Trumbull, who, years after the battle, {{had a conversation with}} British Colonel John Small in London. Small had claimed {{that he was in the}} advancing British line during the second attack on the redoubt and that almost everyone in front was killed or wounded by a volley fired from within the redoubt. Small says he was not hit but thought for sure he was about to be killed as several of the rebels trained their muskets on him, at which point Putnam reportedly shouted to the rebels [...] "For God's sake lads, don't fire at that man; I love <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do my brother!" [...] Child dismisses the story that Small was out in front of the line, knowing at the time that the rebels had proved to be excellent marksman and were earnestly picking off British officers, and because it was customary for British officers to march behind rank and file, especially when they are advancing and preparing for a charge with fixed bayonets.|$|E
2500|$|The next to be {{executed}} was Erskine Childers, who had been secretary to the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. Childers was a well-known Republican - it was on his boat, the Asgard, that the guns had been brought in during the Howth gun-running - he was a renowned columnist, novelist, {{and a member of}} the Anglo-Irish, Protestant landowning family of Glendalough House, Annamoe, County Wicklow. He had been captured on 10 November in possession of a Spanish-made [...]32-calibre pocket pistol which Collins had given to him. - or as Charles Gavan Duffy described the circumstances to the Dáil four days after Childers was shot, [...] "The military authorities apparently ascertained that Erskine Childers was living at the home of his childhood in Wicklow; they surrounded the house in the early morning; they found him there and arrested <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understand, getting out of bed with a revolver." [...] Childers and eight others appealed to the civilian judiciary. The Master of the Rolls considered whether a state of war existed. He considered the existence of a Provisional Government in Ireland and its authority to act as proposed and execute the nine.|$|E
2500|$|Antoine Roquentin – The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a café owner named Françoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Françoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had to hang myself." [...] He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." [...] When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E
