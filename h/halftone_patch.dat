40|$|The Yule-Nielsen {{modified}} Spectral Neugebauer reflection {{prediction model}} enhanced with an ink spreading model provides high accuracy when predicting reflectance spectra from ink surface coverages. In the present contribution, {{we try to}} inverse the model, i. e. to deduce the surface coverages of a printed color <b>halftone</b> <b>patch</b> from its measured reflectance spectrum. This process yields good results for cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, but unstable results when simultaneously fitting cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks due to redundancy between these four inks: black {{can be obtained by}} printing either the black ink or similar amounts of the cyan, magenta, and yellow inks. To overcome this problem, we use the fact that the black pigmented ink absorbs light in the infrared domain, whereas cyan, magenta, and yellow inks do not. Therefore, with reflection spectra measurements spanning both the visible and infrared domain, it is possible to accurately deduce the black ink coverage. Since there is no redundancy anymore, the cyan, magenta, yellow, and pigmented black ink coverages can be recovered with high accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} printing accuracies {{and the possibility}} of printing several droplets at the same pixel location, there is a renewed interest in dot-on-dot printing models. In the present contribution, we improve a dot-on-dot spectral prediction model relying on the Yule-Nielsen modified Spectral Neugebauer model by taking into account ink spreading in all ink superposition conditions. Since ink spreading is different when ink dots are printed alone, printed in superposition with one ink or printed in superposition with two inks, we create for each superposition condition an ink spreading function mapping nominal to effective dot surface coverages. When predicting the reflection spectrum of a dot-on-dot <b>halftone</b> <b>patch,</b> its known nominal surface coverage values are converted into effective coverage values by weighting the contributions from different ink spreading functions according to the corresponding ratio of colorant surface coverages. We analyze the colorimetric prediction improvement brought by our ink spreading model for dot-on-dot thermal transfer prints and for ink-jet prints. Accounting for ink spreading according to different ink superposition conditions considerably improves the prediction accuracy. In the case of ink jet prints at 120 lpi, the mean ΔE 94 difference between predictions and measurements is reduced from 4. 54 to 1. 55 (accuracy improvement factor: 3). Due to the slight misregistration between the ink layers, spectral predictions accounting for ink spreading in the case of dot-on-dot screens are less accurate than corresponding predictions for classical mutually rotated screens...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{automatic}} method {{for measuring the}} tone response curve of display devices based on visual methods, where the eye is replaced by an end-user, uncalibrated camera, such as a webcam. Our approach compares a series of <b>halftoned</b> <b>patches</b> of known covering ratio with a continuous series of tone patches for each ratio. Both patches are shot by a camera that {{is used as a}} virtual eye to evaluate the luminance difference. By an iterative process, the continuous tone value is adjusted while compared with the perceived level of the <b>halftoned</b> <b>patch.</b> When the camera does not see any difference between the patches or a minimal difference, the luminance level of the continuous patch corresponds to the relative luminance of the <b>halftoned</b> <b>patch</b> covering ratio. We demonstrate that the method is as accurate as an equivalent visual method. The advantage of using a camera over the human eye is due to the limitation of observer variability while performing visual tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Yule–Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model (YNSN) enhanced for {{accounting for}} ink spreading {{in the different}} ink superposition conditions provides accurate spectral predictions, but requires one to measure the reflectances of special <b>halftone</b> calibration <b>patches</b> in order to compute the ink spreading curves mapping nominal ink surface coverage to effective ink surface coverage. Printing special <b>halftone</b> calibration <b>patches</b> within {{the borders of the}} print pages is cumbersome, since these special patches need to be cut out before assembling the final printed product. In the present contribution, we calibrate the ink spreading curves directly from the printed images by fitting them so as to minimize a distance metric between predicted reflectances and measured reflectances at selected relatively uniform locations. We compare the prediction accuracy of the so-calibrated YNSN model with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of classical uniform calibration patches. Interestingly, when the model is calibrated from image tiles originating from the same or from a similar color image as the one comprising the test tiles, better prediction results are obtained than when performing a classical calibration on 50 % <b>halftone</b> <b>patches</b> printed in all superpositio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Yule–Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model (YNSN) enhanced for {{accounting for}} ink spreading {{in the different}} ink superposition conditions requires a spectrophotometer to measure the reflectances of <b>halftone</b> calibration <b>patches</b> in order to compute the ink spreading curves mapping nominal ink surface coverage to effective ink surface coverage. Instead, {{as a first step}} towards the “on the fly ” characterization of printers, we try to deduce the ink spreading curves from digitized RGB images of <b>halftone</b> calibration <b>patches.</b> By applying the Yule–Nielsen broadband formula to the average RGB intensities, we deduce the effective dot surface coverages of <b>halftone</b> calibration <b>patches.</b> We then establish the ink spreading curves mapping nominal dot surface coverages to effective dot surface coverages. By weighting the contributions of the different ink spreading curves according to the ratios of colorant surface coverages, we predict according to the YNSN model the reflectance spectra of the test patches. We compare the prediction accuracy of the YNSN model calibrated by digitized RGB intensities of the calibration patches with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of these calibration patches. The decrease in spectral prediction accuracy due to RGB model calibration is about 30 % for ink jet prints and 10 % fo...|$|R
40|$|Most {{existing}} techniques for regulating the ink flow in offset presses rely on density measurements {{carried out on}} specially printed patches. In the present contribution, we develop a methodology to deduce ink thickness variations from spectral measurements of multi-chromatic <b>halftone</b> <b>patches</b> located within the printed page. For this purpose, we extend the Clapper-Yule spectral reflectance prediction model by expressing the transmittance of the colorants composed of superposed inks {{as a function of}} the ink transmittances and of fitted ink layer thicknesses. We associate to each ink an ink thickness variation factor. At print time, this ink thickness variation factor can be fitted in order to minimize a difference metric between predicted reflection spectrum and measured reflection spectrum. The ink thickness variations deduced from multi-chromatic halftones allow to clearly distinguish between normal ink volume, reduced ink volume or increased ink volume. This information can then be used for performing control operations on the printing press...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is composed of}} two projects that were carried out independently. Both projects are related to document composition analysis. The applications of the first study correspond {{to the area of}} printer forensics, and the second study concerns to the area of document layout aesthetics. ^ Common forensics tasks such as verifying ownership, authenticity, and copyright of a document can be accomplished through the use of imperceptible marks or signatures contained in an electrophotographic (EP) hard-copy document. These signatures can be inherent or intrinsic to the printing process, or they can be artificially produced and embedded in the document at any stage of the printing pipeline. In the past, our laboratory has reported techniques to embed extrinsic information at a printer mechanism level in electrophotographic text documents and halftone images through the modulation of the laser beam intensity. But in the absence of suitable <b>halftone</b> <b>patches</b> or text characters, another strategy to embed signatures in the document is needed. In this study, the use of forms, such as the frames that surround the contents of bank statements, event tickets, and boarding passes, among other security documents, is proposed. This new embedding context broadens the embedding domain and offers the possibility of using error-correcting coding techniques from the area of communications. ^ On the other hand, technology has allowed us to measure many different aspects of images, but it is still a challenge to objectively measure their aesthetic appeal. A more complex challenge is presented when an arrangement of images is to be analyzed, such as in a photo-book page. In general, the studies that have attempted to measure the appeal of a document layout make use of geometric features such the position and size of single objects. But many of the aesthetic characteristics that graphic designers and artists use in their daily work have been left out of the analysis. The main goal of our study is to incorporate aesthetic graphic design concepts within an automated photo layout generation tool. Among other design techniques, the tool makes use of layering and transparency in the layout to produce a professional-looking arrangement of the pictures. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{spectrophotometer}} {{as an alternative to the}} densitometer for pressroom applications, it becomes desirable to use a single three-color overprint <b>halftone</b> gray <b>patch</b> for controlling color on the press. As a consequence, the need for new specifications in colorimetric units, rather than SID and dot gain units, arises. The purpose of this study was to conduct a mathematical conversion of the traditional SID and dot gain specifications into the colorimetric specifications, in terms of the CIELAB coordinates. The FIPP dot gain and SID specifications were applied to the gray patch contained in the Gretag CMS 3 color control bar. This gray comprises an overprint of 75 % cyan, 62 % magenta, and 60 % yellow. Applying all possible SID and dot gain tolerances to this gray results in overall 225 three-color overprint grays. By employing computer programs containing the GRL Trapping Model, (2) the GRL Dot Gain Model, and (3) the Yule-Nielsen modified Spectral Neugebauer Model, the CIELAB coordinates of the 225 grays were predicted without taking actual spectrophotometric measurements on press sheets. The CIELAB coordinates of these grays were then plotted in the three-dimensional L* a* b* space. The shape of the cluster of these 225 grays is nearly spherical. The largest deviation of one of XI these grays from the aim gray is 4. 7 AE*ak units. Varying any dot area by ± 2 % or changing any SID by ± 0. 1 causes a color deviation of less than 3 (delta) E*ab units...|$|R
