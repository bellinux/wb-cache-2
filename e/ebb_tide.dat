40|$|The Peel-Harvey Estuary in {{south-western}} Australia {{became so}} eutrophic in the 1970 s and 1980 s that a radical approach was adopted {{in order to}} increase tidal exchange between this estuary and the ocean and thereby flush greater volumes of nutrients out to sea. This involved constructing a deep artificial (Dawesville) channel between the estuary and the ocean, at a location ca. 15 km south of the shallower and natural (Mandurah) channel. Samples of fish larvae were collected monthly throughout 1997 to determine whether the characteristics of the ichthyoplankton on flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> differed within and between channels and whether they underwent the same types of intra-annual changes in the two channels. In both channels, the number of species and concentration of larvae were both significantly greater on flood than <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> and the species composition differed significantly between tides. The concentrations of larvae were at their greatest, by far, between early spring and early autumn. Flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in both channels were dominated by the goby Favonigobius lateralis, which was transported out on <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> as preflexion larvae and subsequently brought back on flood tides as postflexion larvae. The larvae of Hyperlophus vittatus, Pseudorhombus jenynsii and Rhabdosargus sarba, which spawn outside the estuary, were far more abundant on flood than <b>ebb</b> <b>tides,</b> whereas the reverse pertained with Atherinosoma elongata, Apogon rueppellii and Pseudogobius olorum, which spawn within the estuary. In contrast to the situation with the diversity and concentration of larvae, the species composition on both flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> differed significantly between channels. However, the latter differences were small and mainly due to relatively greater numbers of larval F. lateralis on <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in the Mandurah Channel and the very occasional occurrence of reef species on flood tides in the Dawesville Channel. During the year, the species composition underwent cyclical changes on both tides and in both channels, due to out of phase sequential monthly changes in the concentrations of certain species...|$|R

30|$|Most fish {{mentioned}} above decreased in density during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> at the intertidal stations (W and L). However, although the water depth at W also decreased during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides,</b> as at L, some deeper tidal creeks or burrows (depth, 0.3 to 1.0  m) in these meadows maintained sufficient water volume for some fish inhabitance. Indeed, {{we did find}} many fish still residing within these shallow areas at W {{as long as there}} is space for them to move, while most of these fish were absent at L during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides.</b> We postulate that these refuges may serve as important temporary shelters for fish in intertidal zones when neighboring areas are exposed to the air. These fish may stay in these shallow water refuges during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in order to avoid predators. The water columns here may support sufficient volume for scarids, lethrinids, and lutjanids, but are too shallow for large piscivores, such as lemon sharks, which are the main predators of these fish; lemon sharks were absent in intertidal zones during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides.</b> Similar shallow water usage patterns were documented for L. fulviflamma in tropical seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean (Dorenbosch et al. 2004) across the tidal cycle. Moreover, for scarids, staying in these shallow refuges not only allows them to avoid predators but also permits them to forage on the more nutritionally-rich seagrass shoots that are found in these shallow areas (Lee et al. in review).|$|R

25|$|Sooke was a {{town with}} a {{sheltered}} small harbor near {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, and the route there from Victoria required Sechelt to cross {{the eastern part of the}} Strait of Juan de Fuca, a notoriously dangerous body of water, which had then recently (in 1904) claimed the then-new steamboat Clallam, a much larger, newer, and stronger built vessel than Sechelt, Clallams sinking in nearly the same waters was well known in shipping circles and there was talk that Sechelt was not fit for the route. The vessel ran in the narrow passage between Race Rocks Lighthouse and the mainland, which was often hazardous in any conditions, but particularly on an <b>ebb</b> <b>tide.</b> Still as a condition of her insurance, just before James and Jarvis bought the vessel, her underwriters had required a through overhaul out of the water, which cost $6,000, the entire vessel having an insured value of $9,000.|$|E
25|$|In April 1808 Nymphe was {{cruising}} off Lisbon, {{in company}} with the 18-gun sloop , Commander George Pigot, when Captain Shipley learned that the 20-gun brig Gaivota was lying by Belém Castle, making ready to sail. At 21:00 {{on the evening of}} 23 April a force of eight boats with 150 officers and men from Nymphe and Blossom set out to capture her. Unfortunately, a strong <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> fed by heavy rains set in, slowing their approach and it was not until 02:30 that the boats of Nymphe reached the brig. Captain Shipley led the boarders, climbing the fore-rigging and attempting to cut away the boarding-netting, but he was shot and fell into the river. His brother, Charles Shipley, serving as a volunteer, immediately ordered the gig to pick him up, but the boats fell afoul of each other and became entangled with a caulking stage moored astern. Having lost the element of surprise, and with the boats of Blossom failing to reach the brig, the enterprise was abandoned. As well as her captain, Nymphe lost a seaman, and one marine was wounded. Captain Shipley's body was later recovered and it was evident that he had been killed instantly by a musket ball through the forehead. Commander Pigot was appointed by Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, the commander-in-chief on the coast of Portugal, to be Captain Shipley's successor on board Nymphe; and on 17 September he was confirmed in his post-rank. Captain The Hon. Josceline Percy, was later appointed to command her, while operating off coast of Spain.|$|E

25|$|The wind shifted, and Ranger recrossed the Irish Sea to {{make another}} attempt at raiding Whitehaven. Jones led the assault with two boats of fifteen men just after midnight on April 23, 1778, hoping to set fire to and sink all Whitehaven's ships {{anchored}} in harbor, which numbered between 200 and 400 wooden vessels and consisted of a full merchant fleet and many coal transporters. They also hoped to terrorize the townspeople by lighting further fires. As it happened, the journey to shore was slowed by the still-shifting wind, {{as well as a}} strong <b>ebb</b> <b>tide.</b> They successfully spiked the town's big defensive guns to prevent them being fired, but lighting fires proved difficult, as the lanterns in both boats had run out of fuel. To remedy this, some of the party were sent to raid a public house on the quayside, but the temptation to stop for a quick drink led to a further delay. Dawn was breaking by the time they returned and began the arson attacks, so efforts were concentrated on the coal ship Thompson {{in the hope that the}} flames would spread to adjacent vessels, all grounded by the low tide. However, in the twilight, one of the crew slipped away and alerted residents on a harbourside street. A fire alert was sounded, and large numbers of people came running to the quay, forcing the Americans to retreat, and extinguishing the flames with the town's two fire-engines. However, their hopes of sinking Jones's boats with cannon fire were dashed because of the prudent spiking.|$|E

40|$|Saltmarsh-dwelling grapsid crabs release free-swimming larvae (i. e. zoeae) into <b>ebbing</b> <b>tides</b> during spring-tide cycles that inundate saltmarshes, where initial {{inundation}} is a cue for larval {{release on}} subsequent inundations. In a saltmarsh environment, crab zoeae {{are the main}} food for fish (including the glassfish, Ambassis jacksoniensis), which 'fast' at other times. This saltmarsh-feeding model was tested by obtaining glassfish from near saltmarshes in a reasonably unmodified tributary of a large temperate estuary on flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> during the night in two spring-tide events in austral autumn of 2009. Glassfish fed only on <b>ebbing</b> <b>tides,</b> with stomachs being similarly full on both spring-tide events. Thalassinid larvae (including Trypaea australiensis) dominated the dietary volumes, especially {{on the night before}} saltmarsh inundation, presumably being released during inundation of intertidal mud and sand habitats. Although glassfish progressively 'switched' to feeding on greater volumes of crab zoeae (presumably released after inundation of a saltmarsh) over both spring-tide cycles, such zoeal contributions never exceeded those of thalassinid larvae. The above differences highlight that, although <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> trigger feeding by glassfish, this ambassid focuses on different prey in a reasonably unmodified environment. The ability of glassfish to switch prey, and thus accommodate environmental differences, helps explain their high abundance in estuaries of this region...|$|R
