5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case <b>for</b> <b>emotional</b> investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced {{to come to terms with}} the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, Triple H {{announced}} that Hornswoggle {{was the new}} DX mascot. This came about after Hornswoggle sued DX <b>for</b> <b>emotional</b> and physical distress due to them not allowing him to join DX. After being taken to court where they were ruled guilty by a jury and judge consisting of dwarves, Michaels told Triple H that Hornswoggle could be the mascot. Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to. On January 11, 2010 episode of Raw, Mike Tyson, who was the Raw guest host for the night, teamed with Jericho to face DX; however, {{at the end of}} the bout, Tyson turned on Jericho and aligned himself with Triple H and Michaels. On the February 8 episode of Raw, DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship to ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) in a triple threat elimination tag match, also involving The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). On the March 1 episode of Raw, they lost a rematch for the title. This was their last televised match before Michaels retired. Michaels and Triple H had a non-wrestling reunion at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Emotion is an {{essential}} part of user experience. While researchers are striving for new research tools <b>for</b> evaluate <b>emotional</b> experiences in design, designers have been using experience-based tools for studying emotions in practice, such as mood boards. Mood boards were developed <b>for</b> communicat-ing <b>emotional</b> qualities between designers and clients, but have not yet been considered as an evaluation tool <b>for</b> investigating <b>emotional</b> experience. In t his study we examined whether design students and non-design students have similar criteria in evaluating these mood boards. The results showed that the inter-rater reliability among all participants were considerably high, which suggested that mood boards are potential to be used as an evaluation tool for research on emotion...|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the legal coming of age often does not {{correspond}} with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers <b>for</b> <b>emotional</b> and financial support.

25|$|Two {{groups of}} {{individuals}} were investigated, those concerned with personal power, achievement, and independence (agentic group) or those concerned with relationships, interdependence, and others (communion group). Agentic types consistently recalled emotional memories {{of events that}} involved issues of agency such as those involving mastery, dominance, and humiliation. In contrast, communal types showed a recollection bias <b>for</b> <b>emotional</b> memories featuring others, often significant others, in acts of love and friendship.|$|E

25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} {{as they relate to}} the Big Five {{personality}} traits: openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness). Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women <b>for</b> <b>emotional</b> reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E
