Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown {{for the first time}} writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit <b>down</b> <b>together</b> and watch the sun rise over the city.|$|E

5|$|After the Aaron Echolls trial, he is {{interviewed by}} press and cheering fans. Veronica tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) that the Manning father has offered $20,000 for {{the capture of}} Woody. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III) about Jackie (Tessa Thompson) leaving. Keith visits Vinnie (Ken Marino) in prison, and they agree to track Woody <b>down</b> <b>together.</b> Veronica and Keith learn that Woody was treated for chlamydia. In a dream, Veronica shares a happy family breakfast before her graduation, meeting Wallace {{for the first time}} that day before meeting Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). Veronica makes a fake call as Gia to Woody's lawyer, and he reveals that Woody was living at the Quail Creek Lodge under the name Mr. Underhill. At Veronica's graduation, Keith says that he's going to chase Woody, and Mac (Tina Majorino) tells Veronica that she is going to a hotel with Beaver that night. Just before he can graduate, Weevil (Francis Capra) is arrested for the murder of Thumper (James Molina). Veronica {{graduates}} and says goodbye to Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels).|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit <b>down</b> <b>together.</b> A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

25|$|The next day, {{a series}} of {{meetings}} and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike. By , virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut <b>down,</b> <b>together</b> with many commercial and service enterprises.

25|$|The staff's {{indifference}} {{to many of}} the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders.

25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo. His process for composing the music consisted of him reading the game's story, {{to get an}} as full as possible understanding of the setting and the character personalities. He considered his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and events to be very important: he would write them <b>down</b> <b>together</b> {{with the kind of}} music he would want to use for each scene, and keep them in mind when composing the music. He said that this approach, while taking longer than if he had just designated songs to various places in the game, made for higher quality music with a better relation to the game's worldview.|$|E
25|$|Near 2:00 A.M. on April 27, 1865, when Sultana {{was just}} seven {{miles north of}} Memphis, her boilers {{suddenly}} exploded. First one boiler exploded, followed a split second later by two more. The cause of the explosion was too much pressure and low water in the boilers. There was reason to believe allowable working steam pressure was exceeded {{in an attempt to}} overcome the spring river current. The enormous explosion of steam came from the top, rear of the boilers and went upward at a 45-degree angle, tearing through the crowded decks above, and completely demolishing the pilothouse. Without a pilot to steer the boat, Sultana became a drifting, floating hulk. The terrific explosion flung some of the passengers on deck into the water and destroyed a large section of the boat. The twin smokestacks toppled over, one backwards into the blasted hole, and one forward onto the crowded forward section of the upper deck. The forward part of the upper decks collapsed into the exposed furnace boxes, shoving kindling into the open fire boxes which soon caught fire and turned the remaining superstructure into an inferno. Survivors of the explosion panicked and raced {{for the safety of the}} water but in their weakened condition soon ran out of strength and began to cling to each other. Whole groups went <b>down</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{recommends}} that resistance {{take the form}} of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as stakeholders, users, health-care providers and consumers of education to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities. Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and [...] "the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces' control of information." [...] Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of citizen politics, a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems—everything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion. Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in scrupling, the process of sitting <b>down</b> <b>together</b> to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns. She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them [...] "whether those in power like it or not." [...] The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin's words, on [...] "turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world's citizens." ...|$|E

Madonna's voice was starting to get strong and she was into trying new things." [...] During the bridge, they performed a fragment of Motown group The Temptations' 1971 hit [...] "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)". In his review of the concert in New York City, The New York Timess Jon Pareles felt that during the performance the music was reminiscent of [...] "Motown, girl groups and James Brown." [...] After the song was finished, an interlude, featuring a pierrot and several dancers dressed in black outfits and holding umbrellas began. Set to an instrumental version of the song, the interlude featured a choreography partially inspired in the classic Gene Kelly musical Singin' in the Rain. According to author Michelle Morgan, Kelly himself advised Madonna on some of the choreography. The performance on the November 19, 1993 show at Sydney Cricket Ground was recorded and released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 26, 1994, as [...]|$|E
