5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform.

This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014.

25|$|Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is {{restricted}} to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation.

The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; <b>food</b> <b>inspection</b> services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.|$|E

Liberal leader Stéphane Dion was harshly critical and drew comparisons to the 2000 Walkerton tainted water tragedy and the privatization of propane inspection, which he blamed for the 2008 Toronto explosions. Gerry Ritz responded that the CFIA had added 200 inspectors since the Conservatives came to power, adding, [...] "As opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line, they'll have a more oversight role within the plant itself [...] We're trying to build a better mousetrap here."

40|$|Background. Food fraud/adulteration {{has ever}} {{increasingly}} become a dominant food {{issue of the}} modern world in both developed and developing countries. It is presumed that globalisation is mainly one of the underlying reasons. Objective. To assess and analyse the occurrence of food fraud on the Polish market during 2005 - 2012. Material and Methods. Adulteration of foodstuffs was determined from official <b>food</b> <b>inspections</b> carried out by the Agri-cultural and <b>Food</b> Quality <b>Inspection</b> (IJHARS) in 2005 - 2012. On average, foodstuff manufacturers inspected ranged from 1300 companies in 2011 to 3000 in 2006. The amount of results so collected, allowed a meaningful assessment to be thus made of food fraud on the Polish market. Results. Food fraud was found to vary in the Polish market for the specific areas researched (ie. organoleptic properties, physico-chemistry and labelling) {{as well as in the}} agri-food sector. Levels of food fraud were not significantly different to those observed in other countries. Conclusions. Appropriate control measures, at both national and international levels, are thereby indicated to halt the adulteration of foodstuff products that constitute a health hazard or pose a life-threat to consumers as well as constituting a financial fraud. Key words: authentic food, food fraud/adulteration, food quality, organoleptic properties, labelling, plant derived food...|$|R
