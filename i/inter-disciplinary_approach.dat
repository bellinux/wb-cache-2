5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approach</b> connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E

Homer-Dixon takes an <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approach</b> {{connecting}} political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, and ecology. The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct his theory.

I argue that assumptions about {{the relationship between}} social movements and human rights that are fundamentally normative limit our understanding of the diversity of organisational forms through which human rights are being defined, and of the complexity of multi-scalar law through which claims to justice are being made. In particular, the importance of the state and national law for institutionalising human rights norms should not be neglected by privileging either local or international law as the legitimate focus of democratic claims for justice...|$|R

40|$|Children tend to {{be missing}} from the {{literature}} on human rights. Sociology can help {{to fill the gap}} by providing evidence about the importance and benefits of recognising children's human rights, the dangers of not doing so, and joint rights-promoting work by adults and children. However, sociology has paid relatively little attention to human rights, and to the related topics of the Holocaust, human nature, real bodies, universal principles and moral imperatives. This paper examines splits in sociology around a central absence, which could partly explain these omissions. Then it considers how <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approaches</b> and critical realism can help to theorise and validate “the inherent dignity and…the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family“. The youngest children's rights illuminate meanings in all human rights, which depend less on the rational person approach than on recognising human nature, vulnerability and solidarity interacting with social structures...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe papers {{gathered}} {{in this volume}} deal with the re-constructions, uses, transmissions and negotiations of “collective memories” in various identity settings. They focus on the dynamics of heritage-making, mapping the inventory of symbols and strategies retained, selected and manipulated by various actors to set compelling identities inside their mainstream society. The common argument of <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approaches</b> is to provide insights into the issue of mobility, mediation, circulation and re-cycling at work in cultural heritage agencies. By suggesting to our authors to scrutinise alternative views on heritage compared to the official ones, our objective was to put different conceptions of “collective identity” in dialogue, in order to illustrate the diversity of representations about cultural heritage, from the nation-state’s endeavour to give a shared sense to “collective identity”, to the individuals’, minorities’, diasporas’ or local communities’ competing glances on heritage as a self-knowledge process granting meaning of their identity as well...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} differing ideologies, belief systems, cultures, {{histories}} and power structures at {{the basis of}} violent conflict, ultimately people are the creators, benefactors and victims of this violence. Much of the substance of conflict falls under the domain of social psychology, and previous research has made great progress in understanding the processes that underlie intergroup relations. Several high-status researchers have argued for the necessity of social psychological research to augment and inform other theories of violent conflict, mainly those used by political scientists and International Relations analysts (see, for example, Kelman, 2008). However, these <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approaches</b> are in their infancy. Moreover, social psychological contributions {{to the understanding of}} war and other forms of violent conflict lack integration with political theories of conflict resolution, and as such are often marginalized, ensuring social psychology’s inability to inform and augment policy formation in this area. There are several reasons for this. Traditional research paradigms, and th...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{has emerged}} {{not only as}} a global concept, but also as a {{principle}} and goal which includes a set of values. In despite of the international acceptance of the concept, there is a long path to be transited in order to establish a real consensus about its meaning and applicability. The conceptual application of sustainability to Bioethics is more than a proposal about the extension of the topics that traditionally have been adjudicated to this new “discipline”. The text attempts to assess the rationale implied in Bioethics questioning the disciplinary and <b>inter-disciplinary</b> <b>approaches</b> of its internal epistemology. This evaluation will take into consideration the actual frameworks developed from ecology and earth system analysis. The main thesis to be sustained is that, in order to gain theoretical sustainability, Bioethics would need to adapt itself to a transdisciplinary approach. Following this suggestion, Bioethics will be able to face the actual requirements of a future society...|$|R
