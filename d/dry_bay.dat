500|$|The Tlingits regard Glacier Bay {{as their}} sacred {{homeland}}. The National Park Service takes {{the view that}} [...] "Glacier Bay National Park is the spiritual homeland of the Huna Tlingit, and Glacier Bay National Preserve is the homeland of the Ghunaaxhoo Kwaan unit of the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe". The tribes' oral history supports that they were pushed out and migrated south when the glacier advanced. [...] They {{moved back to the}} area when the Glacier retreated in the 1880s. There are 60 odd proto-historic or historic sites in the Glacier Bay, which are identified with Tlingit Indians or European Americans. They {{are an integral part of}} Northwest Coast people inferred to be belonging to Haida, Tlingit or Eyak clans. Their settlements existed even in the 1880s in <b>Dry</b> <b>Bay,</b> Excursion Inlet, Point Couverden and the Port Frederick area (now known as Hoonah) and Dundas Bay. A Tlingit cemetery of the period has also been located in the park area. Seasonal hunting, gathering and fishing was their way of life, woven around a central village, with shifting fishing and hunting camps. The food source of the natives was the rich Salmon fish resources of the area. A complex society evolved with rich artistic traditions. Tlingits claimed their fishing-dependent lifestyle was helped during the National Monument years, which kept out commercial fishing. [...] After the area became a National Park, their fishing and hunting activities were curtailed except for certain religious exemptions. However, the National Park administration is closely interacting with the Tlingits to foster their cultural heritage. They are allowed access to the park to [...] "harvest berries, a variety of seafoods, and traditional use items such as spruce roots and mountain goat hair (for weaving traditional blankets)". In addition the park is planning to establish a Tlingit longhouse near its main office, where Tlingit culture would be fully highlighted and also facilitate holding of cultural events.|$|E

5000|$|During the Vietnam War the United States {{suffered}} combat losses totalling some 5000 aircraft: 2500 fixed-wing {{jets and}} 2500 helicopters. As losses increased {{during the course}} of the conflict, studies were initiated to find a way to reduce the loss rates, with research that continued after the war. The research analysis revealed that fuel fires and explosions accounted for 50% of the losses, and that half of these were attributable to fuel explosions in voids or so-called <b>dry</b> <b>bays.</b> As a result, the military services in the USA and elsewhere joined in an effort to improve the survivability of jet aircraft and helicopters. [...] This led to development and experimentation with a variety of approaches that addressed fire extinguishing in several areas, including engine nacelles/bays, <b>dry</b> <b>bays,</b> fuel tanks, occupied spaces such as cabins and cargo bays, and ground and ship flight decks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>bays</b> are the {{compartments}} immediately {{adjacent to}} fuel tanks or other flammable fluids. They frequently contain fluid lines, control lines, electrical equipment, etc. Ballistic damage {{to some of}} these bays, from penetration due to weapons fire or other causes, can allow fuel to enter the bay causing fire after contact with electrical components, and loss of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The passive {{protection}} {{afforded by}} ballistic foam {{is very simple}} and inexpensive compared to active protection. One method of active protection is done by filling large <b>dry</b> <b>bays</b> with inert gases which will not sustain a flame. This process is very expensive and complex. Active protection only offers a “one time” chance for ballistic protection while the ballistic foam is always available.|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, the sudden breakup {{of a natural}} dam on the Alsek River caused a severe flood.

50|$|Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve {{occupies}} the northernmost {{section of the}} southeastern Alaska coastline, between the Gulf of Alaska and Canada. The Canada-US border approaches to within 15 mi of the ocean in the St. Elias Mountains at Mount Fairweather, the park's tallest peak at 15300 ft, transitioning to the Fairweather Range from there southwards. The Brady Icefield caps the Fairweather Range on a peninsula extending from the ocean to Glacier Bay, which extends from Icy Strait to the Canada-US border at Grand Pacific Glacier, cutting off {{the western part of}} the park. To the east of Glacier Bay the Takhinsha Mountains and the Chilkat Range form a peninsula bounded by the Lynn Canal on the east, with the park's eastern boundary with Tongass National Forest running along the ridgeline. The park's northwestern boundary, which also abuts Tongass National Forest, runs in the valley of the Alsek River to <b>Dry</b> <b>Bay.</b> The preserve lands comprise a small area at <b>Dry</b> <b>Bay</b> — the majority of Glacier Bay lands are national park lands. The park boundary excludes Gustavus at the mouth of Glacier Bay. The lands adjoining the park to the north in Canada are included in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park.|$|E
50|$|The Alsek {{starts at}} the {{confluence}} of the Dezadeash River and Kaskawulsh River in Kluane National Park and Reserve. After flowing south into the northwestern tip of British Columbia, it is joined by the Tatshenshini River in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park. It reaches the Pacific Ocean at <b>Dry</b> <b>Bay,</b> in the Gulf of Alaska, south of Yakutat, Alaska, close to the northern end of the Alaska Panhandle. Although the river is navigable by kayak or rubber raft in its northern reaches, it rapidly becomes unnavigable - for any but the most experienced and skilled kayakers - at Turnback Canyon.|$|E

Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|R
5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively <b>drier.</b> <b>Bay</b> salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|R
5000|$|Ballistic foam {{is placed}} in the dry bays to provide a barrier between the spark and the fuel. As bullets or {{shrapnel}} penetrate the mold line skin surrounding the outermost portions of the <b>dry</b> <b>bay,</b> the ballistic foam deprives sparks of oxygen. Thus when the article punctures the fuel tank, a fire is not started. Not only does the foam displace oxygen, but all gases, including explosive vapors which could magnify the destructive effects of ballistic attack. Dry bays, voids, may also contain “onboard ignition sources” like hot surfaces and electrical sparks which benefit both from a lack of gases and the fire-retardant nature of the foam.|$|E

40|$|The new C- 5 M engine pylon was {{subjected}} to live fire testing {{as part of the}} overall C- 5 RERP Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program. The pylon was designed, as much as possible, to physically separate the flammable fluid carrying lines from the ignition sources. This was done by routing the flammable fluid carrying lines through the structural box while the ignition sources are routed from the engine core compartment to the wing/pylon interface through the pylon leading edge. Designed into the pylon are fire resistant materials for structure, hydraulics, fuel, and bleed air lines. The pylon also provides fluid drain lines for potential flammable fluid line fitting leaks, and ventilation in flammable fluid areas. Twelve ballistic shots were performed on this unique, orthogrid construction engine pylon.

The deflagration/detomtion tube was lengthened from 7. 5 to 10 m, the spiral insert in the test section was removed, and the fuel was switched from ethene to propane to produce uninhibited pressure ratios below 9 : 1 and turbulent flame speeds between 300 and 600 m/s.
