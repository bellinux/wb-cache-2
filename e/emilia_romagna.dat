5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} traditional Italian music began in about 1850, {{with a group}} of early philological ethnographers who studied the impact of music on a pan-Italian national identity. A unified Italian identity only just started to develop after the political integration of the peninsula in 1860. The focus at that time was on the lyrical and literary value of music, rather than the instrumentation; this focus remained until the early 1960s. Two folkloric journals helped to encourage the burgeoning field of study, the Rivista Italiana delle Tradizioni Popolari and Lares, founded in 1894 and 1912, respectively. The earliest major musical studies were on the Sardinian launeddas in 1913-1914 by Mario Giulio Fara; on Sicilian music, published in 1907 and 1921 by Alberto Favara; and studies of the music of <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> in 1941 by Francesco Balilla Pratella.|$|E

Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy white sauce is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna.</b> In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called pesto originates from Genoa. In Central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, amatriciana, arrabbiata and the egg-based carbonara.|$|E

In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese {{used to make the}} Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily high quality wines are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.|$|E

2500|$|Not much {{is known}} about Titus Maccius Plautus' early life. It is {{believed}} that {{he was born in}} Sarsina, a small town in <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> in northern Italy, in around 254 BC. According to Morris Marples, Plautus worked as a stage-carpenter or scene-shifter in his early years. It is from this work, perhaps, that his love of the theater originated. His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the names [...] "Maccius" [...] (a clownish stock-character in popular farces) and [...] "Plautus" [...] (a term meaning either [...] "flat-footed" [...] or [...] "flat-eared", like the ears of a hound). [...] Tradition holds that he made enough money to go into the nautical business, but that the venture collapsed. He is then said to have worked as a manual laborer and to have studied Greek drama—particularly the New Comedy of Menander—in his leisure. His studies allowed him to produce his plays, which were released between c. 205 and 184 BC. Plautus attained such a popularity that his name alone became a hallmark of theatrical success.|$|E

Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

In the first part, we present the current framework of the Italian airports showing the great role of the low cost carriers (hereafter LCC), then the history of the former flag carrier Alitalia is discussed. In the second part, we will discuss the strategies implemented by airports to attract air carriers, by means of three case studies (Aeroporti di Puglia, Alghero’s airport, <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna’s</b> airports). It emerges how discounts on landing and/or terminal charges, revenues guarantees scheme, co-marketing agreement are deeply used in many Italian airport. Since the majority of these airports are publicly owned, it could result both in public transfer to cover losses and in unjustified public expanses to maintain underused or unnecessary airports due only to political reasons. The constraint on public transfer foreseen in the proposed national airport plan, could be the first step towards a more rational framework. On the other hand, due to the high unpredictability and evolution of the aviation sector, the national plan should not become a strict planning tool to imperatively decide which airports should grow and develop...|$|R
