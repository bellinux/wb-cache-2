5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> {{due in part to}} the price tag of $9695, an extraordinary amount of money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E

5|$|On 7 January 2010 a Brussels-London train {{broke down}} in the Channel Tunnel, {{resulting}} in three other trains failing to complete their journeys. The cause of the <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> the onboard signalling system. Due to the severe weather, a limited service was operated {{in the next few}} days.|$|E
5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E

40|$|Heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> {{a global}} problem. It is {{estimated}} that approximately 38 million people worldwide experience heart failure, and this number is growing because of the ageing of nations’ populations, but also because patients are rescued from death during an acute myocardial infarction, and later develop heart failure. The prevalence of heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> roughly 2 % of the population, and up to 10 % in people aged 75 years and older. It is also estimated that the lifetime risk of heart failure {{at the age of}} 40 years is approximately 20 % (one in five) for both men and women. Heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> also increasing in low- and medium-income countries, probably because of changes in lifestyle which favour the development of obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The mortality of heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> worse than that associated with most cancers. Average mortality is roughly 50 % within five years. However, evidence-based treatment did reduce mortality significantly. About two thirds of the economic burden of heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> owing to hospital admissions and re-admissions. Therefore, heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> also an expensive disease. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, White {{and his wife}} resided in St. Petersburg, Florida during the winter season. White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. {{at the age of}} 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The medical {{certification}} of White's death stated the cause of his heart <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable to}} take the port. This <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> significant; his front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E
40|$|Pathophysiology {{of heart}} <b>failure</b> has <b>been</b> {{considered}} to be a damaged state of systolic function of the heart followed by a state of low cardiac output that <b>is,</b> systolic heart <b>failure.</b> Even if systolic function is preserved, left ventricular filling in diastole can be impeded and resulted in elevation of filling pressure and symptoms of heart failure. This kind of heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> called diastolic heart failure. Nowadays, diastolic heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), whereas systolic heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> referred to as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In this paper, the similarities and differences between the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of diastolic and systolic heart <b>failure</b> <b>were</b> reviewed. Although diastolic heart <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> a common condition of heart failure worldwide, its pathophysiology has not been sufficiently elucidated. This is thought to be the most significant reason for a lack of established treatment methods for diastolic heart failure. We hope to proceed with future studies on this topic...|$|R

5|$|These moves {{initiated}} the Siege of Tobruk. Although isolated by land, the garrison was {{supplied by the}} Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port. This <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> significant; Erwin Rommel's front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies regained the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Though the Indian Navy {{achieved}} significant {{success with}} Operation Trident, its main target, the oil storage facilities in Karachi, were still operational as {{only one of}} the two missiles fired had hit them. This <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> later assessed as the result of confusion created between the commanding officers of the three missile boats. Furthermore, the Indians mistook tracer fire from the coastal artillery of Karachi as originating from Pakistani aircraft, and retreated hurriedly before they could properly target the tanks. After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up aerial surveillance of its coast as the presence of large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched.|$|E

5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failurethe same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making {{the sign of the cross}} during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E
