40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, English, Literature, 2014 My Master???s Project {{explores the}} {{construction}} of place/space in Harjo???s poems {{as a form of}} ceremony. I argue that Harjo utilizes language as a tool to construct the place/space necessary for her as well as <b>her</b> <b>communities</b> to engage in discourse with each other in resistance. The following elements of ceremony, time/memory and song/dance/drum are linked together with place/space through Harjo???s continued membership and contribution to <b>her</b> <b>communities</b> of women of color. Ultimately, I argue Harjo uses the strength she gains from her membership and contribution to <b>her</b> <b>communities</b> to confront and transform from her encounter with cultural knowing. I do so through a close analysis of the connections between Harjo, Harjo???s persona as speaker, and <b>her</b> <b>communities</b> in <b>her</b> poems ???Anchorage,??? ???Call it Fear,??? and ???Strange Fruit. ??...|$|R
