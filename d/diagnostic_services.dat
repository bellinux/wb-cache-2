40|$|Access to point-of-care (POC) <b>diagnostics</b> <b>services</b> is {{essential}} for ensuring rapid disease diagnosis, management, control, and surveillance. POC testing services can improve access to healthcare especially where healthcare infrastructure is weak and access to quality and timely medical care is a challenge. Improving the accessibility and efficiency of POC <b>diagnostics</b> <b>services,</b> particularly in resource-limited settings, may be a promising route to improving healthcare outcomes. In this review, the accessibility of POC testing {{is defined as the}} distance/proximity to the nearest healthcare facility for POC <b>diagnostics</b> <b>service.</b> This review provides an overview of the impact of POC diagnostics on healthcare outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and factors contributing to the accessibility of POC testing services in LMICs, focusing on characteristics of the supply chain management and quality systems management, characteristics of the geographical location, health infrastructure, and an enabling policy framework for POC <b>diagnostics</b> <b>services.</b> Barriers and challenges related to the accessibility of POC diagnostics in LMICs were also discussed. Bearing in mind the reported barriers and challenges as well as the disease epidemiology in LMICs, we propose a lean and agile supply chain management framework for improving the accessibility and efficiency of POC <b>diagnostics</b> <b>services</b> in these settings...|$|R
25|$|Clinical {{laboratory}} sciences are {{the clinical}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services</b> that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis {{and management of}} patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.|$|E
25|$|Group {{practice}} {{is the most}} traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services,</b> as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, which allows them to supervise blood banks, clinical chemistry laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.|$|E

2500|$|A report {{published}} by Health Canada in 2008 included statistics on self-reported wait times for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services.</b> The median wait time for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services</b> such as MRI and CAT scans is two weeks with 89.5% waiting less than 3 months. [...] The median wait {{time to see}} a special physician is a little over four weeks with 86.4% waiting less than 3 months. The median wait time for surgery is a little over four weeks with 82.2% waiting less than 3 months. In the U.S., patients on Medicaid, the low-income government programs, can wait three months or more to see specialists. Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors {{do not want to see}} Medicaid patients. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance. A 2009 study found that on average the wait in the United States to see a medical specialist is 20.5 days.|$|E

2500|$|Multispecialty groups, {{composed}} of physicians from clinical specialties {{as well as}} radiology and pathology, are another practice model. In some case, these may be large groups controlled by an HMO or other large health care organization. In others, they are in essence clinician group practices that employ pathologists to provide <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services</b> for the group. These groups may own their own laboratories, or, in some cases may make controversial arrangements with [...] "pod labs" [...] that allow clinician groups to lease space, with the clinician groups receiving direct insurance payments for pathology services. Proposed changes to Medicare regulations may essentially eliminate these arrangements in the United States.|$|E

He quotes several who have visited her institutions or worked in them to establish that the medical care provided does not compare with that provided in a hospice, lacked <b>diagnostic</b> <b>services,</b> and eschewed even basic pain medications. He says that rather than asceticism, her institutions are characterized by [...] "austerity, rigidity, harshness and confusion" [...] because [...] "when the requirements of dogma clash {{with the needs of}} the poor, it is the latter which give way."
