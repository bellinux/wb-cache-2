40|$|Abstract—The {{numerical}} dispersion relation {{governing the}} propagation of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grid is well known. However, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves,</b> by themselves, do not form a complete basis set capable of representing all valid field distributions. A complete basis set is obtained by including inhomogeneous waves, where, in the physical world, constant phase planes must be orthogonal to constant amplitude planes for lossless media. In this paper, we present a dispersion analysis for both <b>homogeneous</b> and inhomogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in the Yee FDTD grid. We show that, in general, the constant amplitude and constant phase planes of inhomogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> are not orthogonal, but they approach orthogonality for fine discretization. The dispersion analysis also shows that, for very coarsely resolved fields, homogeneous waves will experience exponential decay as they propagate and they may propagate faster {{than the speed of}} light. Bounds are established for the speed of propagation within the grid, as well as the highest frequency and the shortest wavelength that can be coupled into the grid. Analysis is restricted to the classic Yee algorithm, but a similar approach can be used to analyze other time-domain finite-difference methods. Index Terms—FDTD methods. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the general}} {{constitutive}} equation for a transversely isotropic hyperelastic solid {{in the presence}} of initial stress is derived, based on the theory of invariants. In the general finite deformation case for a compressible material this requires 18 invariants (17 for an incompressible material). The equations governing infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformation are then used in conjunction with the constitutive law to examine the propagation of both <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> and, with the restriction to two dimensions, Rayleigh surface waves. For this purpose we consider incompressible materials and a restricted set of invariants that is sufficient to capture both the effects of initial stress and transverse isotropy. Moreover, the equations are specialized to the undeformed configuration in order to compare with the classical formulation of Biot. One feature of the general theory is that the speeds of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> and surface waves depend nonlinearly on the initial stress, in contrast to the situation of the more specialized isotropic and orthotropic theories of Biot.
