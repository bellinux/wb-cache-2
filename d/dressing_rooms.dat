Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the <b>dressing</b> <b>rooms</b> were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E

5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the <b>dressing</b> <b>rooms</b> consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the council}} held a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20.
