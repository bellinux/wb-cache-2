5|$|While some {{locations}} <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> require hiking, {{other locations}} {{can be reached}} via automobile transportation. Driving locations also allow guests to observe the night sky in locations other than their campsite or lodge. All of the roads <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> are scenic, but the most famous is the Tioga Road, typically open from late May or early June through November.|$|E
5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> will be electric.|$|E

5|$|Trout were {{introduced}} <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> streams and lakes to promote fishing. Tadpole predation by the introduced fish reduced frog populations. Lakes and streams {{are no longer}} stocked in the park.|$|E
5|$|Badger Pass Ski Area was {{established}} in 1935. The 9-hole Wawona Golf Course opened in June 1918 in a meadow adjacent to the Wawona Hotel. A golf course was later built near the Ahwahnee Hotel <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley, but was removed and converted into a meadow in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Introduced {{animals and}} {{diseases}} had impacted the park area {{by the late}} 19thcentury. Galen Clark noted in the mid-1890s that native grasses and flowering plants <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley had been reduced in number by three-quarters.|$|E
50|$|First {{proposed}} in 1992, YARTS {{was designed as}} a way to reduce traffic and increase accessibility to <b>Yosemite</b> National Park. <b>In</b> May 2000, after 8 years of planning, the bus line officially commenced service <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite's</b> neighboring communities. To date, the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System has provided over 1,000,000 rides.|$|R

5|$|Large floods covered Yosemite Valley in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997. These floods had a {{flow rate}} of 22,000 to 25,000cubicfeet (620 to 700m3) per second, as {{measured}} at the Pohono Bridge gauging station <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley.|$|E
5|$|Bighorn sheep, {{which were}} driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced {{in the east}} of the park. The Park Service and the Yosemite Fund have also helped {{peregrine}} falcons and great gray owls to re-establish themselves. Tule elk, which had been hunted almost to extinction, were housed in a pen <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Broader {{tensions}} in American society surfaced <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> {{when a large}} number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E

5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) have been {{identified}} as noxious pests <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E
5|$|Conditions <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E
5|$|John Muir wrote {{articles}} popularizing {{the area}} and increasing scientific interest in it. Muir {{was one of the}} first to theorize that the major landforms <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur. Muir wrote scientific papers on the area's biology. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted emphasized the importance of conservation of Yosemite Valley.|$|E

5|$|Simple lodgings, {{later called}} the Lower Hotel, were {{completed}} soon afterward; the Upper Hotel, later renamed Hutchings House and eventually known as Cedar Cottage, was opened in 1859. In 1876, the more substantial Wawona Hotel {{was built to}} serve tourists visiting the nearby grove of big trees and those {{on their way to}} Yosemite Valley. Aaron Harris opened the first campground business <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The Yosemite Valley Railroad, {{originally}} {{established with}} the discovery of mineral deposits <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley and Merced Canyon, continued functioning through the early 20th century carrying tourists to Yosemite Valley along the Merced River. El Portal Road, constructed through Merced Canyon in 1926, put an end to passenger service on the railway, but operations continued until the mid-1940s, when major flooding occurred, destroying sections of the railroad.|$|E
5|$|The park can {{be divided}} into 5 {{sections}} for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the Park Service <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite.</b> Park rangers encourage visitors to experience portions of the park in addition to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
50|$|The Amphitheatre {{is one of}} the {{geographical}} features of the Northern Drakensberg, South Africa, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most impressive cliff faces on earth. The cliff face of the Amphitheatre is roughly three times the size of the total combined area of all the cliff faces <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite's</b> famous El Capitan, and more than 10 times the size of El Capitan's most famous (South Western) face. It is part of the Royal Natal National Park.|$|R

5|$|To {{supplement}} their incomes, the rangers trapped predators such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine for their furs, {{a practice that}} survived until 1925. Predator control continued however; 43mountain lions were killed <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> by the state lion hunter in 1927. Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted to local extinction.|$|E
5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite</b> Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats <b>in</b> <b>Yosemite,</b> the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
