To spell out the users' need for present and future telemetry, a representative group of <b>dynamicists</b> was organized under the SAE. Requirements for number of channels per flight, data bandwidths, minimum dynamic range (with stationary and transient data signals considered separately), certain accuracy, phase and other characteristics were established.

Innovation processes {{can be observed}} and modelled at diverse level of analysis: industry, product, organization and processes. Each of these levels implies observing innovation problems with different theoretical lenses although they are strongly interrelated. This papers presents {{a review of the}} approaches followed by diverse practitioners on the use of System Dynamics in innovation. The initial evaluation of the literature suggests that system <b>dynamicists</b> have not followed system hierarchical {{principles to}} model innovation processes. Consequently, the results from one level, e. g. innovation processes, cannot be directly translated into the level above, e. g. industry dynamics. Future directions are suggested...|$|R

And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] and then a few paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as you can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} collaboration between system <b>dynamicists</b> and economists to model a multi-sector, ecological-economic model of population and resource dynamics that is firmly based on economic theory and leverages {{the strengths of}} both fields. The example presented illuminates how an SD approach allows model complexity to be extended in order to effectively model interactions between an economic system and an ecological system. The article demonstrates how SD model analysis can help explain the counterintuitive model behaviors due to increases in the natural resource carrying capacity or regeneration rate. Simulation results also reveal the critical effects of allowing for out-of-equilibrium states (adaptation) on the dynamics of ecological economic systems, a point often missed in the economics literature. These findings, while familiar to system <b>dynamicists,</b> highlight the potential for SD to contribute to other disciplines, including economics...|$|R

40|$|Four {{articles}} {{in this issue of}} topiCS (volume 4, issue 1) argue against a computational approach in cognitive science in favor of a dynamical approach. I concur that the computational approach faces some considerable explanatory challenges. Yet the <b>dynamicists</b> proposal that cognition is self-organized seems to only go so far in addressing these challenges. Take, for instance, the hypothesis that cognitive behavior emerges when brain and body (re-) configure to satisfy task and environmental constraints. It is known that for certain systems of constraints, no procedure can exist (whether modular, local, centralized, or self-organized) that reliably finds the right configuration in a realistic amount of time. Hence, the dynamical approach still faces the challenge of explaining how self-organized constraint satisfaction can be achieved by human brains and bodies in real time. In this commentary, I propose a methodology that <b>dynamicists</b> can use to try to address this challenge...|$|R
