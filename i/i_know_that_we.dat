500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap what could you have been thinking of?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on the ABC's Nightline news program, when asked to explain why 82 percent of cases were declared cleared by exception, Arpaio said, [...] "We do clear {{a higher percentage of}} that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> clear many, many cases – not 18 percent." [...] Nightline contacted the MCSO after the interview and was told that of 7,346 crimes, only 944, or 15%, had been cleared by arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Izz al-Masri {{was escorted}} to the {{restaurant}} by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented {{that she was not}} sorry for what she had done and does not recognize Israel’s existence. [...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] she said. When she first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{they going}} to kill us?" [...] I asked of him, since, from the triumphant {{shouting}} without, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must be in the}} midst of the victorious Usutu.|$|R
60|$|But I {{undertook}} to remedy this evil, and therefore desired {{them not to}} be uneasy at <b>that,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might supply ourselves at Mindanao, the most southerly island of the Philippines.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw that}} both Belcher and Baldwin were looking grave, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must have a}} change of some sort, or the old tale of youth and age would be told once more.|$|R
2500|$|In her {{televised}} {{interview with}} ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson on September 12, 2008, {{she made the}} statement that as a politician she felt that her opinions were to be made openly to the public, but that sometimes it may differ with political legislation. When Gibson asked if she thought Roe v. Wade should be overturned, she replied, [...] "I think it should and I think that states {{should be able to}} decide that issue." [...] Palin also said that she hoped [...] "to reach out and work with those who are {{on the other side of}} this issue, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life." [...] Gibson noted that Republican presidential nominee John McCain allows exceptions for rape or incest, and asked, [...] "Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?" [...] Palin answered, [...] "That is my personal opinion." [...] When pressed on the matter, she said, [...] "My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the mother is endangered. Please understand me on this. I do understand McCain's position on this. I do understand others who are very passionate about this issue who have a differing [...]" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But soot adheres more closely," [...] argued Tony solemnly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shan't get a bath for {{at least}} a week afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, when we {{are making}} arrangements, I'll ask your {{assistance}} and advice, Major Tanglebobs. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> poor women are very bad at business." ...|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade halted. Presently a fat eunuch {{glittering}} in his gold-wrought garments {{like some}} bronzed beetle in the sunlight, came waddling back towards me. He was odious and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hated each other.|$|R
5000|$|Todd Dodge said, [...] "I {{have never}} {{been a part of}} a game quite like this. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would have to score on nearly every {{possession}} and maybe steal a possession or two with turnovers." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was then}} my heart failed, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> lovers were beaten. I {{turned from the}} door without another word to the janitor. [...] "Back," [...] said I to my driver, and got up behind him.|$|R
60|$|Thou knowest all; I cannot see. I trust I {{shall not}} live in vain, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall meet again In some divine eternity.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{both have}} a pennyworth of cream for breakfast, which is brought in in the same little can; and I know who has the most for her share.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our larder is full {{enough for}} us to stand a siege," [...] Patsey said, laughing, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a good stock of wine in the cellar, Jean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps we'll {{be thankful}} {{to get any}} kind of a shake-down, boys," [...] {{announced}} Dick Rover. [...] "This certainly is worse than I anticipated, although <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> couldn't expect much in one of these boom towns." ...|$|R
60|$|The Baron {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} and spoke to his companions. From <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had conquered. One of them left and went outside to where the motor-car, with its great flaring lights, still stood. Then the Baron faced me once more.|$|R
60|$|Immediately <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had reached}} {{the center of the}} base of the Temple of the Sun--the spiral runway led upward past the inner walls of the prison cells. Somewhere above me was Dejah Thoris, unless Thurid and Matai Shang had already succeeded in {{stealing}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Yet <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{shall not}} love like this always. Nothing can ensure the {{continuance}} of love. It will evaporate like a spirit, and so I feel full of fears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not quite}} so clear as common in your language, Pathfinder. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought all to have solemn {{thoughts}} on these occasions, but I see no use in speaking in parables." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl was}} silent for a moment. [...] "Where is 'here'?" [...] she asked presently. [...] "They drove so fast and it was so dark that I had no idea where we were, though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> left the turnpike." ...|$|E
6000|$|My mother smiled {{but father}} {{explained}} in justification, [...] "I {{could feel a}} storm {{in the air and}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had just time to reach the last row if we all worked, and worked hard. As a matter of fact we were all done at four o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fool yourself, you thick-brained Frisian," [...] {{broke in}} Martha angrily, [...] "where {{did you learn}} to teach your betters wisdom? I told the Jufvrouw because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might all of us be swept away, and I thought it well that then she should {{know where to look}} for a key to the treasure." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{hours we}} {{followed}} the dark and gloomy river farther and farther into the bowels of Mars. From the direction and distance <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must be well beneath the Valley Dor, and possibly beneath the Sea of Omean as well--it could not be much farther now to the Temple of the Sun.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us go on,' {{said the}} younger brother, 'and leave this good fellow to wake them, if he can. I cannot rest until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are not too}} late. Let us go on, {{in the name of}} Heaven!' ...|$|E
6000|$|LUBIN. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are taking}} {{up too much}} of Mr Barnabas's time. [Franklyn rises]. May I take it, my dear Barnabas, that I may count on your support if we succeed in forcing an {{election}} before the new register is in full working order? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{had seven}} children, would not you fret yourself? And I hardly {{know how to}} speak to you about it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have already had ever so much of your money, over two {{thousand}} pounds; and I fear you will never see it again." ...|$|E
60|$|We kept up {{this sort}} of thing for two hours. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were doing it wrong. R. C. said bad conditions, but I claimed that these were only partly {{responsible}} for our failure. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> moved about too much, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not cast far enough and wait long enough, and that by all means we should not have cracked bait {{on the bottom of the}} boat, and particularly we did not know when we had a bite! But it is one thing to be sure of a fact and another to be able to practise it. At last we gave up in despair, and upon paddling back toward the launch we saw a school of bonefish with their tails in the air. We followed them around for a while, apparently very much to their amusement. At sunset we got back to the launch and started for camp.|$|R
6000|$|Cal. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were gagged in life; {{at least}} [...] All {{those who had}} not heart to risk their lives [...] 110 [...] Upon their open thoughts; but still I deemed [...] That in the last few moments, the same idle [...] Freedom of speech accorded to the dying, [...] Would not now be denied to us; but since---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} right," [...] the young soldier said. [...] "It is a shameful business. Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were {{coming here to}} be butchers, I would never have taken service under Cortez. What should we have said if, on our first arrival here, when Montezuma entertained Cortez and all the cavaliers, his people had slain them at the feast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} tell me, Sir John," [...] Walter said to the knight, [...] "the merits of this quarrel {{in which we are}} going to fight? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are going in aid of the Countess of Montford; but why she is in a sore strait I know not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor child," [...] she whispered. [...] "Stop there, please. Don't {{be afraid}} to think you've told me this. You see, I am of the world, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all only human. Now, twice {{up and down the}} deck, and not a word. Then I shall ask you something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I dissent from nothing, because I {{have heard}} nothing,' replied Vetranio sullenly. 'I was so {{occupied}} by a private matter of importance during my attendance at the sitting of the Senate, that I was deaf to their deliberations. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are besieged by the Goths--why are they not driven from before the walls?' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{several days}} things went along {{in about the}} same course. I took our {{position}} every morning with my crude sextant; but the results were always most unsatisfactory. They always showed a considerable westing when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been sailing due north. I blamed my crude instrument, and kept on. Then one afternoon the girl came to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thou seest,' I said, 'they {{have taken}} away the door. Is there aught {{with which we}} may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight.' I spoke thus, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must hold this place or none, as there were no inner doors in the palace, the rooms being {{separated}} one from another by curtains. <b>I</b> also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in nowhere else; for the palace is absolutely impregnable, that is, since the secret door by which Sorais had entered on that memorable night of attempted murder had, by Nyleptha's order, been closed up with masonry.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{were in the}} {{position}} of a vessel just rounding Staten Island preliminary to bucking the Horn. And, yet, four days ago, we had run through the Straits of Le Maire and stolen along toward the Horn. Three days ago we had been well abreast of the Horn and even a few miles past. And here we were now, starting all over again and far in the rear of where we had originally started.|$|R
