50|$|The American Gear Manufacturers Association was {{organized}} in 1916 to formulate quality standards for <b>gear</b> <b>inspection</b> to reduce noise from automotive timing gears; in 1993 AGMA assumed {{leadership of the}} ISO committee governing international standards for gearing. The ANSI/AGMA 2000 A88 Gear Classification and Inspection Handbook specifies quality numbers from Q3 to Q15 to represent the accuracy of tooth geometry; the higher the number the better the tolerance. Some dimensions can be measured to millionths of an inch in controlled-environment rooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{trip to the}} Moon {{took just}} over three days. After {{achieving}} orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module, named Eagle, and after a landing <b>gear</b> <b>inspection</b> by Collins remaining in the Command/Service Module Columbia, began their descent. After overcoming several computer overload alarms caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position, and a slight downrange error, Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 m, and guided the Lunar Module to a safe landing spot at 20:18:04 UTC, July 20, 1969 (3:17:04 pm CDT). The first humans on the Moon waited six hours before they left their craft. At 02:56 UTC, July 21 (9:56 pm CDT July 20), Armstrong became the first human to {{set foot on the}} Moon.|$|E
5000|$|Prior {{to each of}} {{the five}} jumps, {{students}} in the AM-490 class receive two gear inspections to ensure their parachutes are fitted and working properly. These thorough inspections guarantee that the parachute's main and reserve canopy firing devices are on and accurately calibrated, and their gear is not defective. Students also receive a comprehensive briefing from the jumpmaster before loading the aircraft. Once airborne, the jumpmaster determines the exit/opening point, which varies with the day's wind patterns, student's receive their third and final <b>gear</b> <b>inspection</b> as the plane turns inbound for the jump run.

40|$|Surface defect {{detection}} and dimension measurement of automotive bevel <b>gears</b> by manual <b>inspection</b> are costly, inefficient, low speed and low accuracy. In order {{to solve these}} problems, a synthetic bevel <b>gear</b> quality <b>inspection</b> system based on multi-camera vision technology is developed. The system can detect surface defects and measure gear dimensions simultaneously. Three efficient algorithms named Neighborhood Average Difference (NAD), Circle Approximation Method (CAM) and Fast Rotation-Position (FRP) are proposed. The system can detect knock damage, cracks, scratches, dents, gibbosity or repeated cutting of the spline, etc. The smallest detectable defect is 0. 4 mm × 0. 4 mm and the precision of dimension measurement is about 40 – 50 μm. One inspection process takes no more than 1. 3 s. Both precision and speed {{meet the requirements of}} real-time online <b>inspection</b> in bevel <b>gear</b> production...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} several in-service {{applications for}} portable phased arrays. OmniScan is new category of instrument using ultrasonic phased arrays, {{as well as}} other technologies (conventional ultrasonics, TOFD, eddy current arrays etc.). Portable phased arrays can operate in manual, semi-automated (i. e. encoded) or fully automated modes, though most of the applications to date have been manual or semi-automated. Unlike conventional ultrasonics, portable phased arrays can provide many different displays, such as A-, B-, C-, D- and S-scans, plus combined displays which significantly help imaging. Most of the new applications so far have been specials, which take advantage of {{one or more of the}} following features: special scan patterns (e. g. S-scans), imaging (e. g. corrosion mapping or weld inspections), inspection speed, restricted space. Portable phased arrays also offer advanced reporting capability, including pre-prepared reports and automatic pasting of images into reports for archiving. Sample applications for portable phased arrays include: • Detection and sizing of SCC in turbine roots • Small diameter austenitic pipe weld inspections • In-service inspection of pipe for SCC • Butt weld inspections • T-weld inspections of bridge structures • HIC – Hydrogen Induced Cracking • Flange corrosion under gasket • Nozzle inspections • Thread inspections • Bridge bolt inspections • Spindle/shaft <b>inspections</b> • Landing <b>gear</b> <b>inspections</b> • Laser weld inspections • Composite...|$|R

40|$|Actuators {{used on the}} United States {{space shuttle}} fleet are {{lubricated}} with unspecified amounts of Braycote 601 (Castrol Braycote) grease consisting of a perfluoropolyalkyl ether (PFPAE) base oil thickened with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filler. Each shuttle has four body flap actuators (BFAs) (two on each wing) on a common segmented shaft and four rudder speed brake (RSB) actuators. The actuators were designed to operate for 10 years and 100 flights without periodic relubrication. Visible inspection of two partially disassembled RSB actuators in continuous use for 19 years raised concerns over possible grease degradation due to discoloration of the grease on several places on the surfaces of the <b>gears.</b> <b>Inspection</b> revealed fretting, micropitting, wear and corrosion of the bearings and gears. A small amount of oil dripped from the disassembled actuators. Whereas new grease is beige in appearance, the discolored grease consisted of both grey and reddish colors. Grease samples taken from the actuators together with representative off-the-shelf new and unused grease samples were analyzed by gravimetry for oil content; by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) for metals content; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for base oil decomposition; and by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for determination of the molecular weight distributions of the grease oil. The Braycote 601 grease was stable after 19 years of continuous use in the sealed RSB actuators and was fit for its intended purpose. There were no significant chemical differences between the used grease samples and new and unused samples. Base oil separation was not significant within the sealed actuators. No corrosive effect {{in the form of}} iron fluoride was detected. The grey color of grease samples was due to metallic iron. The red color was due to oxidation of the metallic wear particles from the gears and the bearings comprising the actuators...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a four phase MM&T program to define, develop, and evaluate an improved inspection system for spiral bevel gears. The improved method utilizes a multi-axis coordinate measuring machine which maps the working flank of the tooth and compares it to nominal reference values stored in the machine's computer. A unique feature {{of the system is}} that corrective grinding machine settings can be automatically calculated and printed out when necessary to correct an errant tooth profile. This new method eliminates most of the subjective decision making involved in the present method, which compares contact patterns obtained when the gear set is run under light load in a rolling test machine. It produces a higher quality <b>gear</b> with significant <b>inspection</b> time and cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Presented {{here are}} {{the results of a}} {{manufacturing}} and technology program to define, develop, and evaluate an enhanced inspection system for spiral bevel gears. The method uses a multi-axis coordinate measuring machine which maps the working surface of the tooth and compares it with nominal reference values stored in the machine's computer.
