25|$|Oxenstierna is {{regarded}} as a brilliant pragmatist, willing to reconsider his positions. There are examples of discussions within the Privy Council when Oxenstierna rejected laws he himself had earlier introduced, admitting that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> now. His way of examining, reconsidering, testing, and sometimes rejecting his earlier opinions constitutes his legacy more than his ideas on particular points of policy.|$|E
60|$|The poor {{wreck of}} a clergyman, however, {{shook his head}} with {{profound}} conviction. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} gun {{was empty}} Henry retreated. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to use his pistol until it became {{absolutely}} necessary to do so. With all possible speed he reloaded the larger weapon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dead!' {{replied the}} other, with a contemptuous emphasis. 'Not he. You won't catch Ned a-dying easy. No, no. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] responded {{the second}} voice. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than fail me. By the way, you nearly made {{a fool of}} {{yourself}} over Coralie." ...|$|R
6000|$|Densher approved. [...] "He came {{to let her}} <b>know</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> {{than she}} for whom it was she {{had a couple of}} months before, in her fool's paradise, refused him." ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes on Saturdays {{he went to}} look at the hamper lying by the gate, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to get in again. And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse {{had half}} promised a visit.|$|E
60|$|Some {{suggestions}} were proffered {{concerning a}} possible {{change in the}} breeze, and the necessary care in putting about, but Grandcourt's manner made the speakers understand that they were too officious, and that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than they.|$|E
60|$|Crosbie {{had seen}} him on first {{entering}} the room, and had seen every individual in it. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to omit the duty of that scrutinising glance; but it sounded well in his line not to have observed Lord Dumbello.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell him so,' {{retorted}} Peggotty, {{looking out}} of her apron. 'He has {{never said a word}} to me about it. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better.</b> If <b>he</b> was to make so bold as say a word to me, I should slap his face.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Armchair quarterback {{refers to}} a sports fan who thinks that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than the players {{themselves}} and is always eager to shout advice whether he is live at the game or, more commonly, sitting at home in his chair (hence [...] "armchair"). Similarly, the phrase armchair general is {{used to refer to}} somebody who is not in the military but thinks that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than the generals who plan military operations. This term can be used in many of the same situations as backseat driver. In Italy, the term umarell refers to men of retirement age who pass time watching roadworks, offering unwanted advice, similar to a [...] "" [...] in English.|$|R
6000|$|... "You hear him, boys? He can't {{tell the}} truth, try him as you may. He wasn't {{making love to}} Naomi in the garden last night--oh dear, no! He has had one wife already; and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than to take the yoke on his {{shoulders}} for the second time!" ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Ruff ate his luncheon {{alone and}} understood. The {{afternoon}} wore on, {{and at night}} he travelled up to London. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to waste time by purposeless inquiries. Instead he took the nine o'clock train {{the next morning to}} Paris.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the Red Rogue was {{thoroughly}} frightened, {{but he did not}} yet despair of defeating his enemies. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to attempt to oppose Prince Marvel by force, but he still hoped to conquer him by trickery and deceit.|$|E
6000|$|This {{officer was}} a wise man; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to tell an {{incredible}} truth. He said nothing {{of what he}} had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't of {{very much}} use to give Cheeko advice, for he always thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> {{than any one}} else, and this time, instead of thanking me for taking the trouble to find him among all those thorns, he said as pertly as any sparrow you ever heard: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Margaret, {{and what}} if your father should die in the meanwhile? Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> how deep his hurts are than does this leech. If so, {{you would have a}} sore heart for all your life. Sure you had better go, or at the least I will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Humfrey! <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than Antony how vain {{any hope}} must be of my silly little princess," [...] said Susan, {{with a sigh}} for her boy. [...] "Come in, child, and set these locks in order. The hour of noon hath long been over, and father hath not yet dined." ...|$|R
6000|$|Patience {{could not}} bring herself to take the bag, and he dropped it into her basket [...] "I am sorry for the young man, your brother, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to think to wed her as he is. And 'tis better for all {{there should be no}} women's tears and foolishness over it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arrested? Not much. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> {{than to try}} such a game on me. When I was in his employ I kept my {{eyes and}} ears open, and I knew too much about his private affairs for him to push me, even if I had been guilty. Oh, Sammy Simpson {{knows a thing or}} two." ...|$|E
60|$|The man at {{the wheel}} never moved a spoke. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better,</b> for Captain Dan Cullen was {{standing}} alongside of him. He wanted to move a spoke, to move all the spokes, to grind the wheel down, hard down, for his comrade drowning in the sea. He glanced at Captain Dan Cullen, and Captain Dan Cullen gave no sign.|$|E
50|$|Bernard is very {{stubborn}} and believes <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than his superiors {{who are all}} just desk men. He trusts no one except for his old friend Werner. His secretive and suspicious ways often keep Bernard alive but they just as often get him into trouble and cause harm to many of those around him.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{letters are}} a self-revelation of the man, his work, his [...] ambitions, his trials, his views of religion, his [...] philosophy, his public {{activity}} and domestic happiness.... Whoso reads these volumes will feel that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> a [...] man worth knowing, {{and the number}} who will read them will be [...] great."--London Telegraph.|$|R
6000|$|... "You should know, Jacob, {{that both}} of us stand ready to do all men may to aid your father, an' you may be certain we'll not let you go on alone; but just now Sergeant Corney must be our leader, since <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than you an' I put {{together}} {{what ought to be}} done." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> {{than any}} one that his master was in serious trouble, for when they were alone together, {{when no one was}} there who could see, no one but this true and silent companion, then philosophy, pride, and {{bitterness}} would fly to the winds and a few hot tears would ease the oppression which made Wessex' heart ache almost to breaking.|$|E
60|$|My heart {{went out}} to this young nobleman. Handsome he was, as a picture. And <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than most of your fine gentlemen how to put a check on his inclinations. As a friend he had few equals, his purse being ever at the command of those he loved. And his privations on Fox's account were already greater than many knew.|$|E
60|$|Nor did Lawless wait to {{be twice}} bidden. The terrible result of his fling of just resentment sobered him completely. <b>He</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>better</b> than any one on board, how nearly the Good Hope had gone bodily down below their feet; and he could tell, by the laziness with which she met the sea, that the peril {{was by no means}} over.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{small thing}} that the patient knows of his own state; yet some things <b>he</b> does <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than his physician.|$|R
6000|$|... "How absurd. I <b>know</b> Victor <b>better</b> than {{to believe}} him capable of such a suspicion. Just as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> me <b>better</b> than to believe me capable of such an act." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} on a broken chair to reach something down from the dresser when it 'appened, and {{it was pointed out}} to Joe Barlcomb that it was a thing anybody might ha' done without being bewitched; but <b>he</b> said <b>'e</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better,</b> and that they'd kept that broken chair for standing on for years and years to save the others, and nothing 'ad ever 'appened afore.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl had}} no idea. Mrs. Ruff {{had left for}} the village several hours before; since then {{she had not been}} seen. Peter Ruff ate his luncheon alone, and understood. The {{afternoon}} wore on, and at night he traveled up to London. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to waste time by purposeless inquiries. Instead he took the nine o'clock train the next morning to Paris.|$|E
60|$|What made it worse, {{considered}} Mr. Guilfogle, {{was that}} this Wrenn had a higher average of punctuality than any {{one else in the}} office, which proved that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> Worst of all, the Guilfogle family eggs had not been scrambled right at breakfast; they had been anemic. Mr. Guilfogle punched the buzzer and set his face toward the door, with a scowl prepared.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{open hand}} but shows our loss, [...] For <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> how to live. [...] Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss, [...] Look {{up in the}} sun's eye and give [...] What the exultant heart calls good [...] That some new day may breed the best [...] Because you gave, not what they would [...] But the right twigs for an eagle's nest! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Some {{might be}} {{blind to the}} Castro regime's {{brutality}} and ruthless oppression, but Alfonso Fanjul's betrayal is compounded because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better.</b> <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> very well that any investments made with the Castro regime will not help the Ladies in White, Unión Patriótica de Cuba, the Orlando Zapata Tamayo National Civic Resistance and Civil Disobedience Front, or other pro-democracy groups, but rather, will {{go straight to the}} pockets of the Cuban people’s jailers and continue to prop them up.|$|R
6000|$|... “He isn’t fit to hear what’s said here. He {{believes}} it’s all true. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> no <b>better.</b> <b>He</b> {{gets into}} his passions over it.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{supplier}} sells {{at lower}} price his products because he reduces his expenses in marketing research. He also {{profits from the}} customer's increase in fidelity. By joining the affinity partner, the supplier strengthens his reputation. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> his target audience simplified {{by the fact that}} he has access to the affinity group's information and has the opportunity to carry out some research programs with its members.|$|R
