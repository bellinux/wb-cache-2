5|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal bony fishes such as croakers and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush <b>hard-shelled</b> prey. Curiously, two bowmouth guitarfishes examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing <b>hard-shelled</b> reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing <b>hard-shelled</b> prey.|$|E

25|$|Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) {{consist of}} both ambush predators (‘spearers’) and foragers (‘smashers’).

40|$|Legumes play an {{important}} role in human nutrition, especially among low-income human groups in developing countries. Beans are particularly important in Brazil for two reasons: Brazil is the largest producer and consumer of grain legumes in the world and the fact that beans are a major source of protein for many people. The objective of this study was to evaluate the <b>hard-shell</b> percentage in seven common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) cultivars, by using the Burr cooking method before and after soaking. The following cultivars developed by Embrapa Rice and Beans, in Santo Antônio de Goiás ? GO, obtained from the same area and planting time (winter) were used: BRS Vereda (rosinha); BRS Timbó (roxinho); BRS Grafite (preto); BRS Radiante (rajado); BRS ? Pontal (carioca); BRS Marfim (mulatinho) and Jalo Precoce (jalo). The results revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) among the cultivars in relation to <b>hard-shell</b> and cooking time (before and after soaking). The cultivar Jalo Precoce (jalo) presented the highest percentage of <b>hard-shell</b> (42 %) and cooking time (67. 5 minutes) without previous soaking.

25|$|Hybodonts have a {{wide variety}} of tooth shapes. This variety {{suggests}} that they took advantage of multiple food sources.

Well-developed wear facets on teeth from Lissodus suggest that some hybodontiforms crushed their food. Species described from Thailand have a range of teeth shapes, suggesting multiple feeding habits. Bulbous teeth were used for crushing hard shelled bottom-dwelling prey. Others were opportunistic feeders and were species that had a diet of large soft-bodied prey.|$|E

The female shows a surprising level of maternal care, coiling around the eggs, protecting them from predators, and possibly helping to incubate them, until they hatch around 90 days later. The female guards the hatchlings {{for up to two}} weeks after they hatch from their eggs to protect them from predators in a manner unusual for snakes in general and pythons in particular.|$|E
25|$|Pet crickets spend {{winters in}} a {{different}} type of container made of a gourd (the <b>hard-shelled</b> fruit of Lagenaria vulgaris). The bottoms of the gourds are filled with lime mortar. The carved lids can be made of jade, coconut shell, sandalwood and ivory; the most common motif employs an ornament of gourd vines, flowers, and fruits. The thickness of the lid and the configuration of vents in it are tailored to enhance the tone of a cricket's song. The ancient art of growing molded gourds was lost during the Cultural Revolution, when the old pastime was deemed inappropriate for Red China. 20th-century cricket enthusiasts like Wang Shixiang had to carve their gourds themselves. Contemporary cricket gourds have carved, rather than naturally molded, surfaces. Molded gourds are being slowly re-introduced since the 1990s by enthusiasts like Zhang Cairi.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{in roughly}} 30 {{families}} have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most {{of these species}} are either insectivores (preferring <b>hard-shelled</b> prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey items. Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas. In some cases, {{the color of a}} bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The snow goose, for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross's goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.|$|E
40|$|We {{monitored}} soft-shell and <b>hard-shell</b> legal-sized male snow crabs sampled periodically in {{the field}} or fed to satiation at 4. 5 jC in the laboratory for changes in nutritional condition. In soft-shell crabs, feeding resulted in a significant decrease of water content in all tissues. This decrease was associated with increased lipid (digestive gland) and protein (muscle and haemolymph) contents. The weight of the muscle in the merus {{and the weight of}} the digestive gland also increased. Feeding had no impact on the nutritional condition of <b>hard-shell</b> crabs in the laboratory. In the wild, soft-shell crabs required a much longer period of time to recover to the <b>hard-shell</b> condition than was postulated from earlier studies; nutritional condition of soft-shell crabs did not improve markedly over summer and into autumn.

25|$|Excluding a few contested {{reports of}} much older forms from North America and India, the first complex {{multicellular}} life forms {{seem to have}} appeared at roughly 1500 Ma, in the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic eon.
