2500|$|Ames' {{father and}} uncle (also named Oliver) were leading {{figures in the}} Union Pacific, as well as {{principals}} in Crédit Mobilier of America, a corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroad construction. [...] Oakes Ames, while a member of Congress in the 1860s, sold shares of Crédit Mobiler to other Congressmen, priced at par value, which was well below their <b>estimated</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> [...] When this was exposed in 1872, it was determined by a Congressional investigating committee {{to be for the}} purpose of influencing railroad-related legislation. [...] The scandal resulted in his censure, and he died not long afterward. [...] Ames became co-executor and heir to his father's fortune, which included a nationwide network of business interests, as well as $6–8 million in debts, most of them related to the Union Pacific and Crédit Mobilier scandal. [...] Over a period of years, Ames was able to pay off the debts, provide more than $1 million in bequests, and divide the estate amongst the heirs.|$|E

The results indicate that current appraisal methods produce unbiased <b>estimates</b> of <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Additional empirical results are presented that show that seasonal factors and regional economic conditions significantly explain variation in appraisal error. ...|$|R

Our ability to explain the relatively wide variation in appraisal assumptions with plausible covariates generates confidence in the appraisal process.
