The medium green foliage forms a low growing clump in early spring and in late spring produce flowering stems that grow up the 20 inches tall, the stems end in <b>flat</b> <b>flower</b> clusters.

5000|$|P. myrsinites {{is a low}} {{prostrate}} or spreading evergreen shrub {{growing to}} a meter in maximum height. The stems have many four-angled branches lined with oppositely arranged oval leaves roughly 1 to 3 centimeters long. The leaves are thick, leathery, toothed, and pointed or round-tipped. They are light green when new and shiny dark green when mature. Blossoming occurs from June to August. [...] The inflorescences occur in the leaf axils, where there appears a single flower or cluster of up to three. The small <b>flat</b> <b>flower</b> has four dark red oval petals about a millimeter long. The fruit is an oblong capsule under a centimeter long containing usually one seed in each of its two valves. The seed is dark and shiny and partly covered in a white aril. The shrub reproduces via seed, {{but it can also}} be propagated with cuttings.|$|E
50|$|Regarding {{vegetative}} morphology Miltonia moreliana and Miltonia spectabilis can {{be immediately}} {{separated from the}} rest because their much flatter pseudobulbs, longer rhizome and inflorescences completely covered by flattened bracts that bear only one highly <b>flat</b> <b>flower.</b> These are the species with largest flowers in the genus. They are closely related and usually are recognized because the flowers of M. moreliana usually have dark purple petals and sepals and the lip of a lighter bright purple while M. spectabilis has very light purple or white petals and sepals and a purple veined labellum, however, the real technical difference among the species is on the proportions of their segments which are much wider. Despite colors are often mentioned to identify species they are not accepted by taxonomy as enough to establish distinct species by themselves. All other Miltonia species have similar vegetative appearance and only can be positively identified by their flowers.|$|E

It is native to the southwestern United States, {{where it can be}} found in desert habitat, generally in areas with alkaline or saline soils, such as playas. This halophytic perennial herb or subshrub grows in low matted clumps of woody stem bases anchored to the substrate by rhizome systems. The stem grows erect into fleshy green branches. The inflorescences are within the distal parts of the branches, which are ringed with tiny <b>flat</b> <b>flowers.</b>|$|R

Derived from Rosa rugosa ("Japanese Rose"), native to Japan and Korea and introduced into the West circa the 1880s, these vigorous roses are extremely hardy with excellent disease resistance. Most are extremely fragrant, remontant, and produce moderately double, <b>flat</b> <b>flowers.</b> The defining characteristic of a hybrid rugosa rose is its rugose, i. e., wrinkly foliage, but some hybrid rugosas lack this trait.

The great summer heat and moisture here favour the ascent of various tropical genera, of which I found in August several Orchideae (Calanthe, Microstylis, and Coelogyne), also Begonia, Bryonia, Cynanchum, Aristolochia, Eurya, Procris, Acanthaceae, and Cyrtandraseae.] The rocks were all of gneiss, with granite veins, tourmaline, and occasionally pieces of pure plumbago.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, hats {{for women}} ranged from simple scarves to {{elaborate}} hennin, and denoted social status. Structured hats for women {{similar to those}} of male courtiers began to be worn in the late 16th century. The term 'milliner' comes from the Italian city of Milan, where the best quality hats were made in the 18th century. Millinery was traditionally a woman's occupation, with the milliner not only creating hats and bonnets but also choosing lace, trimmings and accessories to complete an outfit.In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, women wore bonnets that gradually became larger, decorated with ribbons, flowers, feathers, and gauze trims. By the end of the century, many other styles were introduced, among them hats with wide brims and <b>flat</b> crowns, the <b>flower</b> pot and the toque. By the middle of the 1920s, when women began to cut their hair short, they chose hats that hugged the head like a helmet.|$|R
50|$|Lindera are {{evergreen}} or deciduous {{trees or}} shrubs. The leaves are alternate, entire or three-lobed, and strongly spicy-aromatic. Lindera are dioecious, with {{male and female}} flowers on separate trees. The inflorescences are composed of 3 to 15 small flowers existing as pseudo-umbels. They are sessile or on short shoots. The flowers are from greenish to white, greenish-yellow, or yellowish, with six tepals arranged in a star shape. The male flowers have 9 to 15 fertile stamens; the innermost circle of stamens {{can be found at}} the base of the stamen glands. Usually the stamens are longer than the anthers, which in turn consist of two chambers and are directed inwards or sideways. The vestigial ovary is negligible or absent. The base of the flower is small and <b>flat.</b> The female <b>flowers</b> have a varying number of staminodes. Pollination is done by bees and other insects. Lindera fruit have a hypocarpium at the base of the fruit, which in some cases forms a cup that encloses the bottom part of the fruit. The fruit is a small red, purple or black drupe containing a single seed, dispersed mostly by birds. Many species reproduce vegetatively by stolons.|$|R
