The results showed that several regions in the country were near or above economic breakeven. However, we noted that these results only reflected business as usual assumptions. They did not account for existing or prospective external value elements that could, depending on the application, considerably increase PV’s <b>feasibility</b> <b>threshold.</b> In this paper, {{we look at the}} individual and combined impact of the following value elements: (1) Replacement Value, (2) enhanced load management value, (3) emergency value and (4) environmental value. We show that accounting for these elements could significantly increase the size of costeffective niche markets for customer-owned commercial PV installation. 1...|$|E

The nonbacktracking matrix of a graph is indexed by its directed edges {{and can be}} used to count non-backtracking walks of a givenlength. It has been used recently in the context of community detection and has appeared previously in connection with theIhara zeta function and in some generalizations of Ramanujan graphs. In this work, we study the largest eigenvalues of thenon-backtracking matrix of the Erdos-R ˝ enyi random graph and of the Stochastic Block Model in the regime where the number ´of edges is proportional to the number of vertices. Our results confirm the ”spectral redemption conjecture” that communitydetection can be {{made on the basis of}} the leading eigenvectors above the <b>feasibility</b> <b>threshold...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{rail system}} may be {{considered}} {{a useful tool for}} reducing vehicular flows on a road system (i. e. cars and trucks), especially in high-density contexts such as urban and metropolitan areas where greenhouse gas emissions need to be abated. In particular, since travellers maximise their own utility, variations in mobility choices can be induced only by significantly improving the level-of-service of public transport. Our specific proposal is to identify the economic and environmental effects of implementing an innovative signalling system (which would reduce passenger waiting times) by performing a cost-benefit analysis based on a <b>feasibility</b> <b>threshold</b> approach. Hence, it is necessary to calculate long-term benefits and compare them with intervention costs. In this context, a key factor to be considered is travel demand estimation in current and future conditions. This approach was tested on a regional rail line in southern Italy to show the feasibility and utility of the proposed methodology...|$|E

40|$|Midcentury targets {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as a guide to}} climate change policy that can link long-term goals to shorter-term actions. However no explicit mitigation analyses have been carried out of the relationship between midcentury conditions and longer-term outcomes. Here we use an integrated assessment modeling framework with a detailed representation of the energy sector to examine the dependence of climate change outcomes in 2100 on emissions levels, atmospheric concentrations, and technology characteristics in 2050. We find that midcentury conditions are crucial determinants of longer-term climate outcomes, and we identify <b>feasibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> describing conditions that must be met by midcentury to keep particular long-term options open. For example, to preserve the technical feasibility of a 50 % likelihood of keeping global average temperature at < 2 degrees C above preindustrial in 2100, global emissions must be reduced by about 20 % below 2000 levels by 2050. Results are sensitive to several assumptions, including the nature of future socio-economic development. In a scenario with high demand for energy and land, being below 2 degrees C with 50 % likelihood requires a 50 % reduction in emissions below 2000 levels by 2050, which is only barely feasible with known technologies in that scenario. Results suggest that a greater focus on midcentury targets could facilitate the development of policies that preserve potentially desirable long-term options...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adolescent obesity {{has tripled}} {{over the last}} three decades and is {{associated}} with an 80 percent risk of adult obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and decreased life expectancy. Current adolescent obesity medical recommendations include bariatric surgery and appetite suppressants which lower BMI, but present serious health risks. Nutrition and exercise interventions promote health, however, meta-analysis reveal do not lower BMI. Mindful eating, a behavioral skill, reconnecting eating to satiety cues, and has potential as an anti-obesity intervention which lowers BMI, while promoting health. Study Aims: Aim 1 : To determine the effect of a mindful eating intervention compared to usual diet and exercise information on BMI of obese female adolescents. Aim 2 : To determine if the effect of a mindful eating intervention on BMI of obese female adolescents is sustained over time. Aim 3 : To determine the feasibility of conducting a group mindful eating intervention over six weeks for obese adolescent girls in their school setting. Methods: Obesity was measured by Body Mass Index (BMI) = Weight in Pounds / Height in inches x Height in inches x 703. The sample included adolescent females aged 14 - 17 years with BMI> 90 th%. Participants were randomized to an intervention group receiving a 6 week mindful eating intervention and a comparison group receiving the usual care of nutrition and physical activity handouts. Participants' BMI was measured at baseline, immediately post intervention and at 4 week follow up assessing intervention effectiveness. Results: ANOVA results demonstrate a statistically significant difference in BMI between the experimental and comparison groups F(1, 2) = 22. 24, p<. 001. On average, the experimental group's BMI decreased 0. 71, whereas the comparison group's BMI increased by 1. 1 over the 6 week intervention. The experimental group's BMI continued to decline at the 4 week follow up. Attrition from the study was 38 %, below the 45 % set <b>feasibility</b> <b>threshold.</b> A group mindful eating intervention over six weeks for obese adolescent girls was effective in lowering BMI sustained over time is feasible. Teaching the behavioral skill of mindful eating holds great promise for combatting obesity in adolescents.

Current state-of-the-art in plant based, regenerative life support requires resources in excess of resource allocations proposed for candidate mission scenarios. <b>Feasibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> have been identified for candidate exploration missions. The goal {{of this paper is}} to review recent advances in performance achieved in the CELSS Antarctic Analog Project (CAAP) in light of likely resource constraints. A prototype CAAP crop production chamber has been constructed and operated at the Ames Research Center. The chamber includes a number of unique hardware and software components focused on attempts to increase production efficiency, increase energy efficiency, and control the flow of energy and mass through the system to achieve enhanced performance efficiency. Both single crop, batch production, and continuous cultivation of mixed crops Product ion scenarios have been completed. The crop productivity as well as engineering performance of the chamber will be described. For each scenario, energy required and partitioned for lighting, cooling, pumps, fans, etc. is quantified. Crop production and the resulting lighting efficiency and energy conversion efficiencies are presented. In the mixed-crop scenario, with up to 25 different crops under cultivation, 17 sq m of crop area provided a mean of 515 g edible biomass per day (83 % of the approximately 620 g required for one person). Lighting efficiency (moles on photons kWh- 1) approached 4 and the conversion efficiency of light energy to biomass was greatly enhanced compared with conventional growing systems.

40|$|In an {{overlapping}} generations model, rents {{to human}} capital {{play a key}} role in increasing savings. In the absence of such rents, the return to human capital is entirely appropriated by the old and accumulation is entirely determined by the income to fixed factors. If rents are introduced by setting a ceiling on human capital accumulation, the economy may achieve a larger income level, even though the ceiling reduces the economy's <b>feasibility</b> set. <b>Threshold</b> effects and multiple steady states arise because rents to human capital are self perpetuating. Inequality in abilities may be good for growth because it allows inframarginal workers to earn rents on their human capital, which then increase savings. Public education is also good for growth because it gives the young property rights over their own human capital, which are thus equivalent to rents.

40|$|Spin-controlled vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) {{have been}} intensively studied {{in recent years}} because of the low <b>threshold</b> <b>feasibility</b> and the {{nonlinearity}} above threshold, which make spin-VCSELs very promising for spintronic devices. Here we investigate the circular polarization dynamics of VCSELs on a picosecond time scale after pulsed optical spin injection at room temperature. A hybrid excitation technique combining continuous-wave (cw) unpolarized electrical excitation slightly above threshold and pulsed polarized optical excitation is applied. The experimental results demonstrate ultrafast circular polarization oscillations with a frequency of about 11 GHz. The oscillations last inside the first undulation of the intensity relaxation oscillations. Via theoretical calculations based on a rate equation model we analyze these oscillations {{as well as the}} underlying physical mechanisms...|$|R

This research explored {{the potential for}} improvements in material classification using integrated datasets. Hyperspectral (HSI) VNIR and SWIR data from the MaRSuper Sensor System (MSS- 1) were analyzed with HSI LWIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) to determine differences between individual (baseline) and combined analyses. The first integration approach applied separate minimum noise fraction (MNF) transforms to the three regions and combined only non-noise transformed bands from the individual regions during analysis. The second approach integrated over 470 hyperspectral bands covering the VNIR, SWIR, and LWIR wavelengths before using MNF analysis to isolate linear band combinations containing high signal to noise. Spectral endmembers isolated from data were unmixed using partial unmixing. The feasible and high abundance pixels were spatially mapped using a consistent <b>feasibility</b> ratio <b>threshold.</b> Both integration methods enabled straight-forward and effective identification, characterization, and mapping of the scene because higher variability existed between endmembers and background. Results were compared to the baseline analysis. Material identification was more conclusive when analyzing across the full spectrum. Outstanding ThesisContractor, Scitor Corporatio...|$|R

The aim was {{to find out whether}} different pathological structures could be differentiated from each other. Method: The data obtained from 69 gadolinium-enhanced MR-urographic examinations were post-processed to recunstruct a virtual endoscopy of the upper urinary tract using a threshold image segmentation. Results: Different pathological structures (tumor, nephroliths, stenosis) and filling defects could be evaluated from endoluminal view using the virtual endoscopy. By the reconstructed pictures the classification of the presented pathological structures could unfortunately not be achived in each single case. The exact characterisation of the pathological findings based only on the assessment of the surface structure was often impossible.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONFeasibility and Acceptability of Graded In-Vivo Exposure Therapy for Fibromyalgia Patients byMaya Sarah D’EonDoctor of Philosophy in Clinical PsychologySan Diego State University, 2016 University of California, San Diego, 2016 Professor Thereasa Cronan, ChairRationale. Fibromyalgia {{syndrome}} (FMS) is {{a chronic}} pain condition that affects between 1 and 11 % {{of the general}} population worldwide. Aerobic and strength exercises improve FMS symptoms and reduce physical weakness; however, adherence to exercise programs is low. About 40 % of people with FMS have high pain-related fear of movement. The fear-avoidance model proposes that catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and behavioral avoidance lead to the development and maintenance of disability and depression. Graded in-vivo exposure therapy targets these negative components to reduce fear avoidance, and has demonstrated efficacy in improving outcomes in the chronic low back pain population, but has not been examined within the FMS population. Design. A two-armed pilot trial was conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures and an exposure intervention for FMS patients with moderate to high pain-related fear of movement. The intervention was delivered individually to participants over 13 sessions and was compared to a self-management education condition. Recruitment took place over a 1 -year period, and 29 participants were randomly assigned to an intervention condition. Four participants completed the exposure intervention, and eight completed the education condition. Four assessments were conducted to examine changes in process measures, outcome variables, and program satisfaction. The data of primary interest for this dissertation were focused on adherence, attrition, recruitment, eligibility criteria, randomization, assessment measures, treatment trends, and concurrent pharmacological treatment. Results. As per the CONSORT-modified checklist for reporting <b>feasibility</b> research, <b>threshold</b> criteria were used to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the study components. The results indicated that the feasibility and acceptability criteria were met for eligibility criteria, randomization procedures, and assessment measures. The criteria were not met for recruitment procedures, adherence, and attrition, which suggests the need for modifications in these areas. Examination of treatment trends suggests that the exposure intervention produced improvements in variables of interest. In addition, there was limited evidence of concurrent pharmacological treatment for anxiety symptoms. Conclusions. Effective interventions are needed to increase physical activity within the FMS population. Based on these findings, a randomized controlled trial to examine treatment efficacy was recommended, after modifications have been made to the study procedures and the intervention protocol...|$|R
