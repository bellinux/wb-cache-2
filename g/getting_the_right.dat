25|$|The {{downfall}} of the Alberto Fujimori regime left the Peruvian Army {{in a difficult}} state, with some of its senior officers compromised in scandals of corruption and human rights violations. Several reforms were undertaken during the presidencies of Valentín Paniagua (2000–2001) and Alejandro Toledo (2001–2006), among them the prosecution of criminal cases related to the military, the reorganization of the military rank system and an increased civilian supervision through a revamped Ministry of Defense. The outcome of this and other initiatives {{is a major factor}} of order, major preparation, new equipment and development of the Ejército del Perú. G-3 America (G3 and Associates International Corporation) facilitated the incorporation of new technology to eliminate or reduce terrorism. They have been working tenaciously in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> equipment for the Armed Forces while working with the US State Department and US companies to accomplish it.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.|$|E
25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{basically}} three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related {{to how the}} [...] mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> physical parts {{in the right places}} at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by a {{performance}} of Japanese taiko drummers Witer formed Big Pig: [...] "When I saw them, the key to it was orchestration – that each guy had his own part. There was no improvisation at all. So from that point on, I {{knew how to do}} it. It {{was just a matter of}} <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> people". The initial incarnation involved eight or nine drummers, with Witer trying to sing over the poly-rhythmic din; while members of the band came and went. At an early gig Witer's former band mate, Sherine Abeyratne, attended and subsequently joined the ensemble. As a vocalist, she had been a member of various groups: Grand Wazoo, The Editions, Bang, Big Choir, Bob Starkie Shape Up, Gospel Truth, Jo Jo Zep Band, Black Coffee, Dianna Boss and The Extremes, and The Rock Party. In 1988 Sherine recalled [...] "I started joining bands eight years ago, as long as the music was high-energy, really strong, that was the criterion". She had also toured with INXS as a backing vocalist. Another early member was Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{seven years}} {{as a member of}} Girls Aloud, Nadine Coyle {{announced}} plans to release a solo album during the group's hiatus. In May 2009, Coyle announced that she had signed a publishing deal with EMI. She told Late Late Show host Pat Kenny, [...] "I'm writing songs and it's slightly different styles from Girls Aloud, so I'm gonna do that, writing stuff after Girls Aloud. [...] I have loads of material of stuff to do, but it's just about the timing and about getting it right and <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> songs to put out." [...] She enlisted Barbara Charone, who was worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. [...] "There wasn't anything wrong with what had happened or what had gone on for years - because it was really successful," [...] Nadine said. [...] "It just seemed like I had taken a completely different route, personally, in the writing and the production and I wanted a completely new team so we could start afresh." [...] Despite early reports indicating three major record labels interested in Nadine, it was reported that she had failed to earn a solo record deal, even being turned down by Girls Aloud's label Polydor Records. This was denied by manager Bruce Garfield. In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through.|$|E

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor.

60|$|An {{hour later}} Mrs. McGee {{returned}} to her leafy bower alone. She took off her sunbonnet, hung it on its nail on the wall, shook down her braids, took off her shoes, stained with the mud of her husband's claim, and put on her slippers. Then she ascended to her eyrie in the little gallery, and gazed smilingly across the sunlit Bar. The two gaunt shadows {{of her husband and}} lover, linked like twins, were slowly passing along the river bank {{on their way to the}} eclipsing obscurity of the cottonwoods. Below her--almost at her very feet--the unconscious Arthur Wayne was pushing his work on the river bed, far out to the promontory. The sunlight fell upon his vivid scarlet shirt, his bared throat, and head clustering with perspiring curls. The same sunlight fell upon Mrs. McGee's brown head too, and apparently put a wicked fancy inside it. She ran to her bedroom, and returned with a mirror from its wall, and, after some trials in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> angle, sent a searching reflection upon the spot where Arthur was at work.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Ryves {{sometimes}} went out, like Baron himself, with manuscripts {{under her}} arm, and, still more like Baron, she almost always {{came back with}} them. Her vain approaches were to the music-sellers; she tried to compose--to produce songs {{that would make a}} hit. A successful song was an income, she confided to Peter one of the first times he took Sidney, blase and drowsy, back to his mother. It was not on one of these occasions, but once when he had come in on no better pretext than that of simply wanting to (she had after all virtually invited him), that she mentioned how only one song in a thousand was successful and that the terrible difficulty was in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> words. This rightness was just a vulgar [...] "fluke"-- there were lots of words really clever that were of no use at all. Peter said, laughing, that he supposed any words he should try to produce would be sure to be too clever; yet only three weeks after his first encounter with Mrs. Ryves he sat at his delightful davenport (well aware that he had duties more pressing), trying to string together rhymes idiotic enough to make his neighbour's fortune. He was satisfied of the fineness of her musical gift--it had the touching note. The touching note was in her person as well.|$|E
6000|$|The lively bustle in {{the streets}} had been a torture {{that she could not}} bear. It wanted but two days to Christmas and the gaiety of the season, forced or genuine, rang out everywhere. Christmas shopping, with its anxious solicitude or self-centred absorption, overspread the West End and made the {{pavements}} scarcely passable at certain favoured points. Proud parents, parcel-laden and surrounded by escorts of their young people, compared notes with one another on the looks and qualities of their offspring and exchanged loud hurried confidences on the difficulty or success which each had experienced in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> presents for one and all. Shouted directions where to find this or that article at its best mingled with salvos of Christmas good wishes.

Every mother that she passed happy {{in the company of a}} fresh-looking clean-limbed schoolboy son sent a fresh stab at her heart, and the very shops had their bitter memories. There was the tea-shop where he and she had often taken tea together, or, in the days of their estrangement, sat with their separate friends at separate tables. There were other shops where extravagantly-incurred bills had furnished material for those frequently recurring scenes of recrimination, and the Colonial outfitters, where, as he had phrased it in whimsical mockery, he had bought grave-clothes for his burying-alive. The [...] "oubliette!" [...] She remembered the bitter petulant name he had flung at his destined exile. There at least he had been harder on himself than the Fates were pleased to will; never, as long as Francesca lived and had a brain that served her, would she be able to forget. That narcotic would never be given to her. Unrelenting, unsparing memory would be with her always to remind her of those last days of tragedy. Already her mind was dwelling on the details of that ghastly farewell dinner-party and recalling one by one the incidents of ill-omen that had marked it; how they had sat down seven to table and how one liqueur glass in the set of seven had been shivered into fragments; how her glass had slipped from her hand as she raised it to her lips to wish Comus a safe return; and the strange, quiet hopelessness of Lady Veula's [...] "good-bye"; she remembered now how it had chilled and frightened her at the moment.|$|E
