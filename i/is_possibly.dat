5|$|Capricorn Group on the Great Barrier Reef. The {{presence}} of the Lord Howe subspecies <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> {{the result of a}} chance landing there.|$|E
5|$|Compared with Giraffititan, {{the inner}} ear of A. sp. shows a more basal morphology. That feature <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> related to a {{restricted}} range of possible movements that involve head-turning.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the village}} centre, Rivington Hall, the {{adjacent}} Hall Barn and Great House Barn, which <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> a tithe barn, are all listed buildings. Great House Farm now houses an information centre.|$|E

50|$|Two of the {{seaplane}} trainers (No 461-462) {{built at}} Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven <b>were</b> <b>possibly</b> built to substantially the same design, as <b>was</b> <b>possibly</b> {{one of the}} reconnaissance seaplanes (No 947) built there.|$|R
50|$|Types I, II, III <b>are</b> <b>possibly</b> Reber's.|$|R
5|$|Rick's {{daughter}} Sam (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) attends sixth form {{college and}} regularly extracts money from her father, often by expressing sympathy at his misfortunes. This money is always around forty pounds, and <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> {{being used for}} the purchase of recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of access {{is no longer}} exercised, but it <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining {{privilege of}} peerage.|$|E
5|$|A Javan {{rhinoceros}} has {{not been}} exhibited in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta, and London. At least 22 Javan rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity; the true number <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> greater, as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian rhinoceros.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|C. c. capellanus (P.L. Sclater, 1877) {{is known}} as the Mesopotamian crow or Iraqi pied crow. This {{distinctive}} form occurs in Iraq and southwestern Iran. It has very pale grey plumage which looks almost white from a distance. It <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> distinct enough to be considered a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E

5|$|El Castillo, {{also known}} as Kukulcán's Pyramid, is a Mesoamerican step-pyramid built in the centre of Mayan center of Chichen Itza in Mexico. Several {{architectural}} features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into {{the sides of the}} pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, {{and seems to}} refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> reversible with treatment. This typically involves {{supportive care}} and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E

5|$|The Eichstätt Specimen (JM 2257) was {{discovered}} in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1974. Currently located at the Jura Museum in Eichstätt, Germany, it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head. It <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> a separate genus (Jurapteryx recurva) or species (A. recurva).|$|E
5|$|The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is {{well known}} as one of the first {{transitional}} fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> closely related to the true ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The Peruvian pelican {{is listed}} as Near Threatened because, {{although}} the population is estimated by BirdLife International to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 El Niño event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Niño years; restricting human access to important breeding colonies; and assessing interactions with fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} of its genre to be {{produced}} in the Indies, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was made {{to capitalize on the}} popularity of Wijnhamer and Hollywood characters such as Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer Saeroen suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> lost, Pah Wongso Tersangka, was released later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major threats to the jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural styles date to {{the last}} period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic. One uses well-carved stone blocks for construction and <b>is</b> <b>possibly</b> earlier than the second style, which is believed to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic and uses thin, flat stones.|$|E
