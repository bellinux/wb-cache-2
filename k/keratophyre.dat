Although similar to trachyte, keratophyre's plagioclase component is richer in sodium than the plagioclase found in trachyte. <b>Keratophyre</b> forms lava flows and subvolcanic intrusions (dykes and sills). <b>Keratophyre</b> occurs, for example, at Hüttenrode in the Harz Mountains of Germany {{and in the}} Berwyn Hills of Wales. <b>Keratophyre</b> tuff of Early Devonian age occurs in Sauerland (Germany).|$|E

50|$|Located at {{the east}} end of the Greater Antilles, St. John resides on the northeastern end of the Caribbean Plate. The island formed during the Cretaceous with the {{eruption}} of the Water Island Formation, consisting of <b>keratophyres</b> and pillow basalts.

Volcanism abated during the deposition of the Outer Brass Limestone. Volcanism resumed as evidenced by the Late Cretaceous Tutu Formation, consisting of volcaniclastic turbidites, basalt, and andesite. A diabase dike swarm followed and then compressive folding attributed to the Caribbean Plate colliding with the Bahama Platform. The Late Eocene saw the intrusion of Narrows pluton and Virgin Gorda batholith, associated with the Greater Antilles arc magmatism, and more compressive folding associated with the spreading of the Cayman Trough.

The ground has been described under three sub-titles;- 1. "Prescelly Area". 2. "Imbricate Area". 3. "Western Carmarthenshire Area". Thrusts, hading to the N. N.

The distribution of the rocks in the "Prescelly Area" is governed by the Nevern and Crug-yr-hwch anticlines, and the complementary Brynberian Syncline. Prominent developments of volcanic rocks occur near the base {{and at the top}} of the Lower Alanvirn succession. The "Imbricate Area" is complicated structurally and stratigraphically by the aggregation of thrust planes along this 'belt; of country.

It comprises of well exposed sheeted dykes complex, with pillow lavas as a top unit, which is intruded by intermediate to acid dykes and sills of different geochemistry. We present new geochemical data for both of the units as well as an Ar-Ar age for acid rocks. Investigated samples can be clearly distinguished into the two groups based on geochemical features: i) Samples collected from the sheeted dykes and pillows, show SiO 2 ranging from 47 - 56 %, relatively high TiO 21. 5 - 2. 8 %, and Al 2 O 3 ranging from 12 - 15 %. In terms of trace element geochemistry, they show flat trace element patterns ((La/Yb) n = 0. 5 - 2. 4, (La/Sm) n = 0. 5 - 1. 3 and (Sm/Yb) n = 0. 8 - 1. 2) consistent with MORB compositions; ii) Intermediate to felsic intrusions (<b>keratophyres</b> and adakite-like volcanic) show large range of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 contents (45 - 73 % and 16 - 13. 5 %, respectively), and are markedly depleted in TiO 2, Nb and Ta, as well as enriched in LILE, like U, Th; they also show enriched REE patterns ((La/Yb) n = 3. 56 - 14. 79, (La/Sm) n = 2. 30 - 3. 70 and (Sm/Yb) n = 1. 20 - 4. 04) characteristic for arc volcanic rocks generated in a subduction zone environment. The most mafic members of this group demonstrate many features typical for adakites, like high Al 2 O 3, extreme depletion in HREE with large extent of REE fractionation, high Sr concentrations and high Sr/Y, Sr/Yb, Dy/Yb ratios. Their adakitic features are also seen in trace element compositions of clinopyroxene (cpx) phenocrysts, having high Sr and Dy/Yb for high Mg#, comparable to cpx from Aleutians which is adakitic type locality [...] (Yogodzinski and Kelemen, 1998).

[...] (Saric et al., 2009). Our Ar-Ar potassium feldspar dating gave 164 ± 0. 15 Ma which is in agreement with K-Ar ages available for Macedonian granitic rocks (around 160 Ma). In our view, the rocks which occur within volcanic sequence of Macedonian (FYROM) ophiolites, represent two genetically different magmatic suites. The first one {{represents a}} volcanic member of oceanic crust of MORB composition, probably erupted in a fast-spreading environment. The second suite is younger and we interpret it as being produced by simple mixing or AFC, of the adakite-like primary melts and a felsic end-member similar to the melts which crystallized Jurassic granitic rocks from the area. The extent of granite involvement goes up to 45 % for the most felsic samples from our intermediate suite.

40|$|Triassic {{magmatic rocks}} in the Central Dinarides in Bosnia and Herzegovina are known from two {{separate}} geotectonic units: (1) the Adriatic Carbonate Platform (Outer Dinarides) and (2) the Palaeozoic–Triassic allochthonous complex. They are assigned to the same regional, genetic and geochemical unit. Their emplacement age is inferred from contacts with the surrounding marble and sedimentary rocks (post-Anisian for intrusives and Ladinian for effusives). The magmatic rocks display different levels of emplacement and crystallization (intrusive, effusive and dyke rocks). They represent different stages of magmatic differentiation, from gabbro/basalt via diorite/andesite to granodiorite/dacite and granites. The most frequent dyke rock is diabase. Pillow basalts indicate eruption under subaquatic conditions. Pyroclastic rocks within the volcano–sedimentary unit point to the temporary explosive character of orogenic magmatic activity. Most rocks are affected and modified by post-magmatic alteration and hydrothermal fluids. This {{led to the formation}} of spilite, <b>keratophyre,</b> quartz <b>keratophyre</b> and rarely K spilite.

The samples were progressively demagnetized with AF and, predominantly, thermal methods. Blocking temperatures, coercivities and acquisition of Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) indicate that the <b>keratophyre</b> remanence is variably carried in magnetite, hematite, or occasionally in both. After removal of a soft viscous component, two stable palaeomagnetic directions were found, one in magnetite, the other in hematite. The characteristic magnetite direction (Tb= 300 - 580 °C) is a pre-folding primary Thermoremanent Magnetization (TRM) which after structural correction has a mean declination/inclination of 217. 9 °/- 30. 4 °. The younger hematite component has a mean in situ direction of 320. 4 °/+ 20. 3 °. The microgranite Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) intensity distribution is distinctly bimodal, forming high and low (≤ 1. 6 × A m- 1) intensity groups. Upon demagnetization, a single stable remanence (in magnetite) was removed between 300 and 580 °C or 20 and 100 mT. Two characteristic directions {{were found to be}} statistically related to the intensity groups at the 99 per cent confidence level. Low-intensity samples have a mean direction of 201. 9 °/+ 2. 3 ° and probably resulted from a Late Devonian - Early Carboniferous local magnetization.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The mapped area {{lies between}} the Wallowa Mountains of northeastern Oregon and the Seven Devils Mountains of western Idaho. Part of the Snake River canyon is included. A {{composite}} stratigraphic section includes at least 30, 000 feet of strata. Pre- Tertiary and Tertiary strata {{are separated by}} a profound unconformity. Pre -Tertiary layered rocks are mostly Permian and Triassic volcaniclastic and volcanic flow rocks. At least four pre -Tertiary intrusive suites occur. Tertiary rocks are Miocene and Pliocene plateau basalts. Quaternary glacial materials and stream deposits locally mantle the older rocks. Permian (?) rocks of the Windy Ridge Formation are the oldest rocks and consist of 2, 000 to 3, 000 feet of <b>keratophyre,</b> quartz <b>keratophyre,</b> and keratophric pyroclastic rocks. Unconformably (?) overlying the Windy Ridge Formation are 8, 000 to 10, 000 feet of volcaniclastic rocks and minor volcanic flow rocks of the Hunsaker Creek Formation of Middle Permian (Leonardian and Wordian) age. Spilitic flow rocks of the Kleinschmidt Volcanics are interlayered with and in part overlie the Hunsaker Creek Formation and comprise a sequence about 2, 000 to 3, 000 feet thick. The Paleozoic layered rocks were intruded by the Holbrook - Irondyke intrusives, composed of <b>keratophyre</b> porphyry, quartz <b>keratophyre</b> porphyry, diabase, and gabbro. The Paleozoic rocks were deformed by an orogeny between Middle Permian and Middle Triassic time. Plutonic rocks (Oxbow Complex) of gabbro, quartz diorite, diorite, and albite granite were intruded during Early Triassic (7) time. Movements along the Oxbow -Cuprum shear zone occurred {{during and after the}} intrusions. Middle Triassic (Ladinian) spilitic flow rocks and volcaniclastic rocks of the Grassy Ridge Formation overlie the older rocks with angular unconformity. Thicknesses are 3, 000 to 4, 000 feet in the northeast part of the map area; no rocks of the Grassy Ridge Formation are exposed in the southwest part. The Imnaha Formation of Late Triassic (Karnian) age overlies the Permian strata unconformably near Fish Lake {{in the western part of}} the area. The Doyle Creek Formation of Late Triassic (Karnian) age conformably overlies the Grassy Ridge Formation in the Snake River and Imnaha River canyons and may interfinger with the Imnaha Formation east of Fish Lake. The Doyle Creek Formation ranges in thickness from 3, 000 to 5, 000 feet and includes two members - the Ashby Creek Conglomerate and the Piedmont Point Member. The Martin Bridge Formation, represented by 1, 750 feet of Late Triassic (Norian) limestone, conformably overlies the Doyle Creek Formation. At least two intrusive events apparently occurred during the Jurassic Period. The Jurassic (?) intrusives, were emplaced before regional metamorphism and consist of hypabyssal dikes and sills of diorite, quartz diorite, and dacite and andesite porphyries. Subsequently, the Upper (?) Jurassic intrusives were emplaced during a late stage of regional metamorphism and are represented by small stocks of gabbro, norite, quartz diorite, and gran - odiorite porphyry. A major orogeny during Middle and Late (?) Jurassic time deformed the rocks. Regional metamorphism produced mineral assemblages characteristic of the greenschist facies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Metamorphosed volcanogenic {{rocks of}} the Permian and Triassic Seven Devils Group are exposed in the {{northern}} part of the Heavens Gate 7. 5 minute quadrangle, western Idaho. These rocks originated in a volcanic arc at a destructive plate margin. In the north, rocks that probably belong to the Lower Permian Hunsaker Creek Formation comprise abundant volcaniclastic lithologies and sparse <b>keratophyre</b> and quartz <b>keratophyre</b> flows. To the south, the Middle to Upper Triassic Wild Sheep Creek Formation comprises volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with abundant spilite and <b>keratophyre</b> flows. Trace element analyses of these flow rocks indicate that most are transitional, probably calc-alkaline, island arc volcanic rocks. Some flow rocks may be island arc tholeiites. The lithologic and geochemical character of these rocks is different from that of the Wrangellia terrane, with which they have been correlated. The Seven Devils Group is overlain along a low angle thrust fault by the lower to middle Norian Martin Bridge Formation. This unit is composed primarily of sheared marbles, with local occurrence of unsheared micrite. The Martin Bridge Formation is overlain along the Rapid River thrust by the Upper Triassic Lucille Formation and by the Riggins Group (age unknown). Riggins Group in this area includes metavolcanics of the Lightning Creek Schist and metasediments of the Squaw Creek Schist. They both overlie the Martin Bridge Formation along a single plane of the Rapid River thrust in the southern part of the field area. To the north, the Seven Devils Group, Martin Bridge Formation, Lucille Formation, and Lightning Creek Schist are juxtaposed along imbrications of the Rapid River thrust. Structural elements of the study area indicate that the Rapid River thrust may have affected rocks significantly farther to the west than had been previously recognized. Bedding-parallel ductile shear fabrics occur in volcaniclastic rocks throughout the field area. The intensity of ductile shearing increases toward the low angle thrust fault that separates the Seven Devils Group from the Martin Bridge Formation. This thrust is interpreted to be an integral part of the Rapid River thrust system. An east-west-trending tear fault that separates Wild Sheep Creek Formation from Hunsaker Creek Formation postdates low-angle thrusting, and probably indicates the occurrence of structurally lower thrust faults that have not yet been documented. Tonalites of probable Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age postdate ductile shearing and thrust faulting. This may indicate that deformation of this area occurred during the regionally significant Late Jurassic pulse of the Nevadan orogeny. This event may record the collision of the Seven Devils volcanic arc with North America...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This is {{the first}} {{detailed}} report of the well-developed leucocratic rocks, dominantly plagiogranites, from the Bela ophiolite, the most complete and largest ophiolitic outcrop of Pakistan. A wide range of leucocratic rock types occur within the ophiolite including leucogabbro, gabbroic pegmatite, diorite, quartz diorite, trondhjemite, epidote trondhjemite, granite, <b>keratophyre</b> and acidic pegmatite. Two suites of acidic leucocratic rocks are recognized: a very low potash and high soda suite containing magma-fractionated plagiogranite characteristic of most ophiolites, isaccompanied by an anatectic suite with higher potash content. Each suite possesses distinct trace element and rare earth contents, together with distinctly different Sr and Nd systematics. These differences indicate differences intectonic setting for each leucocratic suite. U-Pb isotopic measurements on zircons separated from the acidic rocks yield a crystallization age of 65 _+ 1 Ma for both the rock suites. On the basis of geochemical data a suprasubduction zone origin dominated by a marginal basin is proposed for the Bela ophiolite. The plagiogranitic rock suite could have been derived from basic magma by fractional crystallization. The potash-richer granitic rocks may have been generated by crustal anatexis forming amelt that locally invaded the ophiolite. Plagiogranites form conspicuous outcrops of relatively small dimensions in most ophiolites.

Brief structural investigations in the area along with petrographic, geochemical studies were conducted on a selection of samples collected in the field, both from mineralized ore horizons and adjacent lithologies. Geological mapping was conducted to produce an updated geological map of the area along with creation of 4 cross section profile sketches produced from the combined impressions of surface mapping and 4 of the logged drill cores.

Deposition {{appears to have been}} continuous from Permian into Upper Triassic, but an apparent angular nonconformity exists between Triassic formations. Neritic clastics of the Permian Trinity Creek formation are overlain by mixed volcanics and elastics of the Triassic Imnaha formation, which is terrestrial and littoral in its lower Russel member and neritic in Its upper Norway member. Sandstone and conglomerate of the Upper Triassic Lower Sedimentary Series apparently rest unconformably on deformed pillow lavas and breccias of the Norway member. A varied suite of small stocks Intrudes the area. Gabbroic units of the Fish Lake complex are most widespread; other stocks are composed of metadiorite, <b>keratophyre,</b> bostonite, and trondjemlte. Varied dikes are extremely abundant In older formations. Marble and skarn of uncertain age, but believed unrelated to the Imnaha or Trinity Creek formations, are intimately associated with gabbroic stocks. Deformation increases from east to west, and culminates with an overturned anticline in the Upper Triassic Lower sedimentary Series at the western margin of the area. Faulting is minor except for the Pine Creek reverse fault which has a minimum vertical displacement of 2500 feet. Alpine topography resulted from Pleistocene stream erosion and glaciation; post-Pleistocene erosion has not been extensive...|$|E
40|$|Sir: We {{appreciate}} {{the effort and}} interesting contribution of Jami et al. (2007) {{on the origin of}} the Esfordi apatite-mag-netite deposit. We have been working in the Bafq mining dis-trict of central Iran for almost eight years, resulting in three graduate theses on the mineralization of the area. Based on our field experiences and mineralogical and geochemical data, we wish to comment on the conclusion of Jami et al. (2007) that Esfordi is a typical Kiruna-type apatite-magnetite deposit. First, the deposit is composed of magnetite-apatite-hematite, rather than simply apatite-magnetite and therefore does not fit an orthomagmatic model for Fe mineralization. Furthermore, many authors (e. g., Force et al., 1991) consider Kiruna-type deposits as volcanic-sedimentary complexes, rather than as a simple, although extended, magmatic-hy-drothermal process such as proposed by Jami (2005) and Jami et al. (2007). Second, the presence of actinolite, albite, chlorite, and tourmaline in brecciated and altered rhyolite (<b>keratophyre)</b> is consistent with a submarine vent complex and feeder zone of an exhalative submarine volcanic system. In this context, the Na metasomatism and albitic alteration could be due to in-teraction with seawater during submarine rhyolitic volcanism. Third, there are many structural and textural features— such as polymictic pebbly sandstone (diamictites), dolomitic clasts (dropstones), conformable iron oxide-apatite layers (lenses), conformable massive apatite ore over the Fe oxide-rich ore, stratiform magnetite-hematite horizons, con-formable Fe oxide-jaspilite carbonate horizons—that all are consistent with the Rapitan-type model of iron phosphorous formation, rather than a Kiruna-type magnetite-apatite de-posit. Diamictites or polymictic pebbly sandstones have been considered as the best indication of Rapitan-type banded iro...|$|E
40|$|Western Tasmania was {{the site}} of geosynclinal {{sedimentation}} during the Cambrian and the Late Precambrian. In the Early Cambrian there was a marked change from Precambrian (?) deposition of sandstones, mudstones and dolomite to a typical synorogenic greywacke sedimentation that continued into the Upper Cambrian. This change was accompanied by extrusion of spilitic and keratophyric volcanics. The basic volcanics are best exposed on King Island and include pillow lavas, breccias called isolated-pillow, broken-pillow, and broken-flow breccias and also tuffs similar to palagonite tuffs in Iceland and "aquagene tuffs" in British Columbia. The pillows (which develop by a combination of surface tension and gravitational effects) and also the finely globular tuffs, indicate an aqueous environment. The spilites contain three principal types: (a) picrite (b) tholeiitic and (c) augite-rich. They are generally low in titania and rich in alumina. Differentiation is characterised by iron enrichment but follows neither alkaline, tholeiitic or calc-alkaline trends. In some areas the volcanics show considerable alteration (with development of hydrogrossular, chlorite, quartz, sericite and calcite) most of which is considered to be of deuteric origin. The spilites are associated with small amounts of <b>keratophyre</b> and quartz <b>keratophyre.</b> Within the Cambrian geosyncline, around the margin of a geanticlinal ridge in the centre of Tasmania (the Tyennan Geanticline) there developed a volcanic arc (the Mt. Read Volcanic Arc) which commenced to form at much {{the same time as the}} spilites but continued to develop probably well up into the Cambrian. This arc is composed largely of quartz keratophyres, both sodic and potassic, which form massive flows and probably also intrusive bodies. Albiteandesites occur near Queenstown. Basal members are characteristically potassic and those near Rosebery (the Primrose Pyroclastics) show many features of ignimbrites or froth-flows. Lenses of banded tuff and mudstone in the Arc indicate aqueous deposition but at least some of the volcanic activity was probably subaerial. Entry of nuees ardentes into the sea, or slumping off the flanks of volcanoes, or submarine volcanic activity, probably gave rise to density currents which swept into the flanking basin to deposit feldspar-rich fragmental rock. Variation diagrams show calc-alkaline affinities for the keratophyres. As in other spilite-keratophyre provinces, the quartz keratophyres are far more abundant than other volcanics and differentiation from spilitic magma seems unlikely. Rocks associated with the spilites and keratophyres include later serpentinites and gabbros and sedimentary cherts, forming a typical ophiolite suite. The Mt. Read Volcanics are intruded by small, partly concordant, sodic and potassic granites. It is tentatively concluded that the spilites and keratophyres are derived from independent magmas intruded during a phase of renewed sagging and stretching of the geosyncline. The intake of water, and possibly other material, into the magmas may have affected the subsequent crystallisation, leading to formation of albite-diopside and albite-chlorite rocks, or the magma may have been hydrous from inception. Some potassic quartz keratophyres contain thick veins of hematite and magnetite at several points along the Mt. Read Volcanic Arc and several of these occurrences have associated copper mineralization. Most of Tasmania's metallic ore deposits (mainly tin, lead, zinc and copper) occur in areas of Cambrian sedimentation and particularly where spilites or keratophyres are abundant. Some of the deposits are clearly related to Devonian granites but the two largest deposits, Mt. Lyell (copper) and Rosebery-Hercules (zine-lead copper) occur in the Mt. Read Volcanic Arc and lack any obvious granitic source. Mt. Lyell ores are mainly pyrite-chalcopyrite, and chalcopyrite-bornite-pyrite assemblages with very minor pyrite-sphalerite-galena lodes. They form lenses replacing cleaved and hydrothermally altered Mt. Read Volcanics adjacent to Ordovician Owen Conglomerate. They were deposited after alteration and cleavage development, both related to the Devonian Tabberabberan Orogeny. The hydrothermal alteration resulted in quartz-sericite and quartz-chlorite "schists" with minor pyrophyllite, and probably took place between 350 and 600 ° at about 800 atmospheres. The temperature of ore deposition is unknown but may have risen to 700 ° C. The NW cleavage, and parallel thrust and transcurrent faults, provided local structural controls but more important controls appear to be the Great Lyell Fault Zones which dates back to the Cambrian, and the distribution of certain potassic keratophyres. Massive hematite bodies at the base of the Owen Conglomerate give a possible indication of pre-Ordovician mineralization. The Rosebery and Hercules ores form discrete pyrite-sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite lenses replacing a fine-grained tuff that overlies the Primrose Volcanics. This tuff exerts a pronounced stratigraphic control and bedding and cleavage are also important on a smaller scale in controlling the orientation of individual lenses. The ores, which are locally banded, follow sericite-carbonate alteration and Devonian cleavage. Local structural controls are not obvious at Rosebery and Hercules but both mines (and other small deposits) lie on a major fault zone (the Rosebery Fault Zone) which probably was active in Cambrian times. The ores show chemical features typical of magmatic deposits and their final phase of deposition was clearly of Devonian age. However, there is evidence of a pre-Ordovician phase of mineralization and the ores may be of volcanic origin, deposited within the Mt. Read Volcanics soon after their eruption...|$|E

The coordinates for Robinson???s geological map were estimated using Google Earth imageryRocks of the northwestern Sierra de San Andr??s of the Vizcaino Peninsula of Baja California Sur, Mexico, form a partial, dismembered ophiolite sequence. Serpentinized harzburgite with minor dunite, orthopyroxenite, and pediform and disseminated chromite comprise the ultramafic section. Ultramafic rocks of cumulate origin are absent. An interior m??lange of sheared serpentinite contains exotic blocks of altered serpentinite, metavolcanic, and metasedimentary rocks which range from greenschist to probable high-grade blueschist facies. A disrupted but intercalated section of layered clinopyroxene-plagioclase ?? olivine cumulates and olivine melagabbro cumulates overlie the ultramafic rocks along low-angle faults. Orthopyroxene (bronzite) is the major intercumulate phase in the olivine melagabbro. Non-cumulate uralite gabbro is exposed in isolated fault blocks adjacent to the cumulate gabbro. Hornblende-bearing plagiogranite locally intrudes the uralite gabbro, resulting in an intrusive breccia. Plagiogranite with a diabasic texture composes another fault block which {{may be part of}} a sheeted dike or sill complex. At least 400 m of microporphyritic plagioclase ?? clinopyroxene pillow lava is exposed. In addition, small scattered fault blocks of plagioclase ?? clinopyroxene spilite and <b>keratophyre</b> may represent rocks derived from a deeper level in the complex. Pillow lava is conformably overlain by tuffaceous shale, friable Buchia piochi-bearing shale, potassium feldspar-poor volcanic arenite, conglomerate and pebblestone of the Upper Jurassic Eugenia Formation. The Turonian middle member of the Valle Formation overlies the ophiolite along low- to high-angle faults of small displacement. The ophiolite complex is cut by a west-trending shear zone and by northwest-trending faults. The latter are probably related to the Cenozoic right-lateral fault system of the northern Vizcaino Peninsula. Chemical analyses of ten gabbroic and volcanic rocks exhibit low K 2 O content and AFM trends characteristic of other ophiolites and abyssal tholeiite. This, together with stratigraphic evidence, suggests that the ophiolite is a piece of remnant oceanic crust which formed close to the Late Jurassic continental margin. It is suggested that prior to emplacement, the ophiolite formed the trenchward part of the upper plate of a Jurassic subduction zone. As a result of water derived from dehydration of the down-going oceanic crust, serpentinite diapirs formed in the mantle above the subducted plate and rose upward to a position below the overlying oceanic plate. The emplacement of the diapirs may have produced Cretaceous and Tertiary uplifting of the Vizcaino Peninsula...|$|E
