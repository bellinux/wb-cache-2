It seems as if DCP may initiate grafting between the polymer and the clay, which results in an exfoliated morphology. The presence of clay seems to inhibit the initiation of EVA crosslinking by the DBP free radicals. These free radicals probably initiate hydroxylated edge-edge interaction between the clay layers, which gives rise to a flocculated morphology and reduced polymer-clay interaction. There is a good correlation between these morphologies and the thermal stabilities and total crystallinities of the nanocomposites.
