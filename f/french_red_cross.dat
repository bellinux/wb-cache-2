5|$|Inès-Marie de Bourgoing, also Inès Fortoul, Inès Lyautey, (5 January 1862 – 9 February 1953) was a {{pioneering}} French nurse {{who served as}} president of the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and established Red Cross nursing in Morocco. In recognition of her extensive social work, she became the first woman to be honoured with the rank of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. She was also decorated as a Grand Officer of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite in recognition of her work in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} nobility, de Bourgoing was educated at court and married an {{artillery}} officer, Joseph Fortoul. Widowed, after raising her children, de Bourgoing chose {{the field of}} nursing {{as a means of}} helping alleviate poverty and participated in the first formal nursing classes offered in Paris. After she began working as a nurse, she went abroad with the Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires, a forerunner of the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> to work in North Africa. In 1907, she joined the SSBM and that same year, travelled to Morocco, where she established an infirmary in Casablanca. Fifteen months later, she assisted in disaster relief following an earthquake in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Dorothy caused several deaths on Martinique, {{although}} the exact death toll is unknown. The National Hurricane Center reported 50deaths, {{although the}} post event report {{provided by the}} French meteorological agency reported 44people dead or missing. Most of the deaths were in Saint-Joseph, where 20people drowned in the Riviere l'Or. Floodwater rescues had been made difficult due to washed out roads and poor communications after the storm. In addition to the deaths, several people were injured. After {{the passage of the}} storm, Martinique was temporarily left isolated, when communications were downed with other nearby islands. The <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> distributed 500blankets and one ton of condensed milk; the agency also sought international assistance.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{she assumed}} the {{management}} of the 300-bed Asnée Military Hospital for spinal cord and head injuries in Nancy. Unable to leave France because of World War II, she initiated programs to provide care packages for troops and POWs in North Africa. In August 1940, de Bourgoing agreed to serve as Vice-President of the newly formed Unified <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross.</b> In 1944, despite the cold winter, she travelled to the front lines in the Vosges to encourage the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division who were engaged in heavy battles with the Germans. When the war ended, she resumed her trips to Morocco, spending several months there each year. In 1946, de Bourgoing was not only appointed Directrice Générale de la Croix Rouge but was elevated to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, the first woman to receive the honour. She was also awarded the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite in recognition of her work in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> {{as a volunteer}} and began working at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary services, they were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E

50|$|In 1188 Henry II of England and Philip II of France {{agreed to}} go on a crusade, and that Henry would use a white cross and Philip a <b>red</b> <b>cross.</b> 13th-century {{authorities}} are unanimous on the point that the English king adopted the white cross, and the <b>French</b> king the <b>red</b> one (and not vice versa as suggested by later use). It is not clear at what point the English exchanged the white cross for the red-on-white one.|$|R

25|$|During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian {{military}} {{formed a}} blockade around the nation's newly independent south-eastern region, Biafra. At this time, France {{was the only}} major country supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. One of the co-founders of the organisation was Bernard Kouchner, who later became a high-ranking French politician.|$|E

500|$|After {{her second}} {{marriage}} in 1909 with Hubert Lyautey, {{who would become}} the first resident-general in Morocco, de Bourgoing {{spent the rest of}} her life dividing her time between France and Morocco, establishing hospitals, maternity clinics and child care centres in both countries. She served as a hospital administrator in France, during both World War I and World War II, and opened a convalescent centre for troops in Salé, as well as a retirement home near La Balme-les-Grottes for the [...] French Foreign Legion. After serving as head of the Ladies Committee of the SSBM (1926–1939), when the three precursor organisations came together as the Red Cross in 1940, she became Vice President of the Central Committee of the Ladies of the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and later Director General of the organisation. Working into her 80s, de Bourgoing remained active until her death in Morocco in 1953. Her remains were later repatriated to France.|$|E

In Toliara, United Nations agencies, including the World Food Programme, and non-governmental organizations worked together to provide food for 3,000people in six shelters. The World Food Programme sent a truck with 1,050tons of food to Toliara, including corn and legumes. A few days after Haruna struck, the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> sent a ship to Toliara with 35tons of supplies, including for housing and water.

500|$|On May12, Malagasy Prime Minister Jacques Sylla {{issued an}} appeal to the {{international}} community for assistance. Due to the damage from Manou, the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> activated its office in Réunion, providing one ton of medicine. The Malagasy Red Cross had pre-positioned emergency supplies earlier in the cyclone season, and after Manou struck, the agency distributed a water purification unit, medicine, and tents to the affected areas. Due to road damage, supplies had to be delivered by boat, which arrived in Vatomandry on May13. The delivery included [...] of supplies. Workers quickly made repairs to power systems. The Malagasy government provided $147,000 to restore health centers in Vatomandry and Andevoranto. Japan provided $80,000 worth of supplies, including tents and jerrycans. Japan, the United States, Norway, and Germany donated about $1.27million to Madagascar for relief. The World Food Programme initially provided 90tons of rice, although ongoing drought conditions and storms caused the agency to continue providing food to residents in southern Madagascar for several months.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1919, Robey {{completed}} a book of memoirs, My Rest Cure, which was published later that year. During the run of Joy Bells he was awarded the Legion of Honour for raising £14,000 for the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross.</b> He declined a knighthood that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences; he was appointed a CBE by George V at Buckingham Palace instead. On the morning of the penultimate Joy Bells performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario Sir Alfred Butt, who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. [...] He and Loraine sang [...] "If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)".|$|E
500|$|During {{the attack}} Lee {{was shot in}} the leg; a bullet hit his left thigh and {{fractured}} his femur. He lay for three days between the lines having been given up for dead. A memorial service was held after the announcement of his death. After three days, Lee was found by the Germans and transported to hospital in Valenciennes. The ten-hour journey was initially made in the passenger compartment of a train, with sacks of straw, before he transferred to a Red Cross train at Lille. For the first week he was looked after by the <b>French</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> before the Germans took over. He remained in Valenciennes for six weeks, and remained bedridden for the duration of his stay. After this time, he was transferred to a second hospital in Hannover. For {{the first half of the}} two-day journey, Lee had to lie on a wooden seat with a blanket under him and his leg in an iron case, which hurt his back significantly, and was provided with no food. The second half of the journey was completed on a Red Cross train. During his stay in Hannover, Lee began to heal quickly, but after receiving advice from a fellow prisoner, he greatly exaggerated the injury, and was selected to be returned to England. He began the journey on 1 October 1915, and boarded the boat for England five days later. Although Lee had amplified the severity of his injury, in England he discovered that one of his legs would be permanently shorter than the other, and he had suffered significant muscle death. He was told that he would neither be able to fight nor play cricket again. He was discharged from the army on 4 December 1915, and was eligible for the Silver War Badge to show that he had served honourably. [...] He later also received the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. After leaving the army, Middlesex paid for Lee to be treated by a specialist, and he was able to play a match for the Army Service Corps against Lancing College in early 1916, in which he scored a century.|$|E
