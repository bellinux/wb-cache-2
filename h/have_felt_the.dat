5|$|Commentators <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{game was}} an attempt to {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry had {{announced}} his plans at the November 1399 parliament, {{he did not}} attempt a winter campaign, but continued to hold quasi-negotiations 'in which he must <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Scots were profoundly irritating.' At the same time, {{it appears that the}} House of Commons was not keen on the forthcoming war, and, since extravagence had been a major complaint against Henry's predecessor, Henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy. At this point, parliament was clearly still opposed to a Scottish war, and may eve have believed a possible French invasion the imperative issue. In June 1400, the king summonsed his Duchy of Lancaster retainers to muster at York, and they in turn brought their personal feudal retinues. At this point, with the invasion being obvious to all, the Scots attempted to re-open negotiations. Although Scottish ambassadors arrived at York to meet the king around 26 June, they returned to Scotland within two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, Sarah L. Winchester (née Pardee), {{the widow}} of William Winchester and heiress to the empire that {{manufactured}} the Winchester rifle, moved from Connecticut to San Jose and began a construction project of such magnitude that it was to occupy the lives of carpenters and craftsmen until her death: the house was continually under construction for thirty-eight years. Before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the Winchester Mystery House reached a height of 7 stories; today it stands three stories with approximately 160 rooms. Many visitors to the house claim to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> presence of ghosts, while others claim there is no detectable presence.|$|E
25|$|The purely {{scientific}} side of Grimm's character developed slowly. He {{seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> want of definite principles of etymology {{without being able}} to discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar (1819) he often seemed to be groping in the dark. As early as 1815 we find August Wilhelm von Schlegel reviewing the Altdeutsche Wälder (a periodical published by the two brothers) very severely, condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained, and insisting on the necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds. This criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm's studies.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{the players and the}} nature of the rules are common {{subjects}} of debate with every edition. It continued to cause confusion until 2013 when it was clarified that the CLT20 rules state the players are free to choose their team. However, for a player named in an IPL team's squad, he would have to forego 20% of his salary to choose another team. The IPL offers the most lucrative salaries and is the only tournament to have a clause relating to the CLT20 in its contracts. As a result, players are unlikely to choose against their IPL teams. For non-IPL teams wanting to keep their players, not only would they be forfeiting the compensation fee, some <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to offer their players compensation in an attempt to sway their decision.|$|E
25|$|Captain Slayter {{had retired}} after his night watch, {{unaware of the}} situation, with orders to steer to Foula. Commander Smith took over the morning watch, and with his former {{knowledge}} of the ship was only happy when the ship was in open sea. Having previously disagreed with his naval superior about dodging around the island, he instructed the navigator to plot a course out to sea. Slayter must <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> course change, as he reappeared on the bridge to countermand Smith's order and made {{what turned out to}} be a hasty and ill-informed judgement which resulted in the ship running directly onto the Shaalds on the morning of 8 September. She was wrecked in a flat calm and clear weather. She was the first Allied passenger ship to be lost in the war.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when his third book was brought out he had retired {{for a short time}} to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as he tells us, of his {{unprofitable}} attendance to the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> charm of the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.|$|E

25|$|Larger chains <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{impact of}} {{discount}} retailers, with some customers switching from larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities. To entice customers into their stores from larger supermarket chains, Poundland advertise familiar brands at competitive prices, {{with the hope}} customers may then be inclined to impulse buy other products such as own-brand that they otherwise wouldn't have purchased. Asda reduced some branded product prices such as Colgate toothpaste to £1 in January 2009, in competition with Poundland who offered the same products at the £1 price; in response, Poundland introduced multi-buy offers to provide a larger quantity of the products for the same price. However, research conducted by The Grocer magazine in August 2009 found that of the 1300-odd supposedly discounted ASDA products, a third were the same price as in March 2008 and 173 products had been selling for less than £1 during Spring 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Browns {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar in the supplemental draft. As a rookie, Kosar {{learned through}} trial by fire {{as he took}} over for Gary Danielson midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit more each Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the ten games Kosar started. Two young rushers, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, played a large part in the team's success, as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards. The Browns' 8–8 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, and they looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoff game with a 21–3 lead at halftime. It took Dan Marino's spirited second-half comeback {{to win the game}} for Miami 24–21. While the Browns' faithful may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC championship game in three of those years.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a bizarre}} double-murder with Satanic ritual overtones in Weston, West Virginia, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are offered the case. Doggett and Reyes ask Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to do an}} autopsy on the murder victims. The agents come to the {{conclusion}} that one of the murder victims was somehow tricked into killing his wife, while evidence at the scene points to two perpetrators. A single clue, the word [...] "Daemonicus", is left spelled out on a Scrabble board the victims had been playing before being attacked. When Reyes claims to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> presence of evil, Doggett responds with great irritation. Dr. Monique Sampson calls them, saying that the murders may be connected to an escaped mental patient, Dr. Kenneth Richman, and a guard, Paul Gerlach.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} the fugitive slave narratives without question, Blassingame admits to scrutinizing his {{reading of the}} texts. He notes that arguments {{against the use of}} these autobiographies used by historians revolve around reliability: [...] "Many historians refuse to use these accounts because they <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> fugitive, as the primary sufferer in the institution, was unable to give an objective account of bondage." [...] Still, Blassingame defends his reliance on autobiographies, noting, [...] "The portrait of the institution of slavery which emerges from the narratives is not the simple picture of hell on earth that most historians have led us to believe they contain. Instead, the fugitives' plantations are peopled with the same range of heroes and villains, black and white, which one generally finds in the human race." [...] Therefore, Blassingame concludes: ...|$|E

[...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

500|$|Far Side Virtual topped The Wires top 50 {{releases}} of 2011—a choice {{that proved to}} be polarizing among readers. Writing to elucidate the [...] "low mandate" [...] for the album, editor-in-chief Tony Herrington noted that only seven of 60 voters included Far Side Virtual on their lists, and no voters chose it as their personal favorite.

500|$|After Patience, Carte {{produced}} Iolanthe, {{which opened}} in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice. Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> long-term contract necessary for his security.

The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music, and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract. In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that [...] "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
