40|$|A <b>gyrostabiliser</b> {{control system}} and method for {{stabilising}} marine vessel motion based on precession information only. The control system employs an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) precession controller (60). This system operates with a gain factor {{that is always}} being gradually minimized so as to let the gyro flywheel (12) develop as much precession as possible - the higher the precession, the higher the roll stabilising moment. This continuous gain change provides adaptation to changes in sea state and sailing conditions. The system effectively predicts the likelihood of maximum precession being reached. Should this event be detected, then the gain is rapidly increased so as to provide a breaking precession torque. Once the event has passed, the system again attempts to gradually decrease the gain...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{dedicated}} spinning wheels that generate gyroscopic forces {{for reducing the}} roll motion of ships was considered and tested over 100 years ago. These devices, known as gyrostabilisers, presented a remarkable performance, but they fell into disuse due to their relatively large size and, primarily, due to {{the inability of the}} control systems to maintain performance over an extended envelope of sea states and sailing conditions (speed and heading relative to the waves). To date, advances in materials, mechanical design, electrical drives, and computer control systems have resulted in a revitalized interest in gyro-stabilisers for ships. This paper revisits the modelling of the coupled vessel-gyrostabiliser and delves into the associated <b>gyrostabiliser</b> control design problem. It also describes design trade-offs and potential performance limitations. A simulation study based on a navy patrol vessel is presented...|$|E
