25|$|A {{new study}} using {{comparative}} molecular <b>field</b> <b>analysis</b> (CoMFA) to establish three-dimensional {{quantitative structure-activity relationship}} (3D QSAR), while searching for novel active pharmacophores as potentially potent HGMR inhibitors, was recently published. Using this novel technique researchers were able to screen for compounds with high screening scores. In addition to the conventional statin-like compounds with HMG-like moiety, eight additional compounds with completely different pharmacophore structure were found. This structure-based virtual screening procedure is considered promising for rational quest and optimization of potential novel HGMR inhibitors.|$|E

The PSAS {{is ready to}} assimilate conventional data and non-conventional data; for the South Hemisphere the conventional data is poor, then the non-conventional data coming from satellite is a alternative to improve the analysis, This paper shows some results about {{the inclusion of the}} data satellite in the PSAS to obtain the initial conditions for the Global Model CPTEC/INPE at CPTEC. We compare first, the number of observations for each 6 hours when is obtained the initial conditions, the number of observations including data satellite, TOVS is almost three times the number of conventional data. The <b>fields</b> <b>analysis</b> of virtual temperature, specific humidity and winds for all the levels in the vertical atmosphere, shows differences between <b>analysis</b> <b>fields</b> with TOVS and without TOVS, mostly in the virtual temperature fields, this difference is because the PSAS assimilate the data satellite like virtual temperature. Finally, the <b>fields</b> <b>analysis</b> including TOVS is more close than the <b>fields</b> <b>analysis</b> without TOVS to <b>fields</b> <b>analysis</b> of NCEP. Pages: 1173 - 117...|$|R

500|$|The terms {{elastance}} and elastivity were {{coined by}} Oliver Heaviside in 1886. [...] Heaviside coined {{a great many}} of the terms used in circuit analysis today, such as impedance, inductance, admittance, and conductance. [...] Heaviside's terminology followed the model of resistance and resistivity with the -ance ending used for extensive properties and the -ivity ending used for intensive properties. [...] The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the [...] "values" [...] of components) and the intensive properties are used in <b>field</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit. [...] Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance. [...] It is the reciprocal of permittivity. [...] As Heaviside put it, ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, intensive {{needs assessment}} requires the ranking of priorities. While {{there are many}} methods to rank needs, {{it is important to}} develop ranking criteria. Feasibility is often used as criteria, but it is often useful for a group to identify their own set of criteria. This part of the research is not so much concerned with developing a detailed plan for solving the needs situation, but rather for examining the depth of the need and potentially required resources. Force <b>field</b> <b>analysis,</b> developed by Kurt Lewin, is one method for facilitating determining needs feasibility. An example taken from Stoecker1 states that if, [...] "for example, feasibility is defined as degree of staff expertise and time, or funds to buy expertise and time, the force <b>field</b> <b>analysis</b> can look for data indicating available staff expertise and time and/or available external funds and expertise".
