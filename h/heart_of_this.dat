These catered to the pockets of non-Chinese residents in the area and shows that despite efforts to segregate the early immigrants, they had no qualms living together, and side by side.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{demographic}} shift in Union-Miles Park was largely complete. The <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> community was centered at Aetna Road and E. 93rd Street, where the majority of Poles and Slovaks began settling about 1890. Whereas once the area had been dominated by descendants of New England Yankees and by Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly populated by immigrant Poles and Slovaks by 1900. To accommodate the large number of children in these immigrant families, the Miles School (not {{to be confused with the}} Miles Park School) opened in September 1899 just outside the southeast boundary of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood at E. 119th Street and Miles Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E
25|$|For Merleau-Ponty, it {{is these}} uses {{of the notion of}} style that lead Malraux to {{postulate}} a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, {{it is important to consider}} the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.|$|E
25|$|In his {{welcoming}} {{address for}} the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to {{set the standard for}} the 21st century public land-grant research university. He has identified as the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries. A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the university has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace. Initial Superclusters in infectious disease and in cancer research have been launched, and an upcoming clean energy Supercluster dovetails with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability. A wind farm is being built to power the main campus, and new residence halls have been constructed according to national green building standards. A sustainability advisory committee has been charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.|$|E

500|$|The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a [...] "fantaisie lyrique" [...] to a {{libretto}} by Colette. She and Ravel {{had planned}} {{the story as}} a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole, and the jazz elements and bitonality {{of much of the}} work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds [...] "profoundly serious feeling at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> vivid and entertaining work".

500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music".

Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There {{is simply too}} much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five.

He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time).

[...] Upon signing Sakic to the deal, Avalanche General Manager François Giguère said, [...] "Joe is the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> organization and his leadership and value to this team and especially our young players is unquestioned." [...] On October 7, 2007, he scored a goal and had an assist against the San Jose Sharks, moving past Phil Esposito into eighth place on the NHL career points list with 1,591.

500|$|At the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{scene is}} Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes {{the sources of}} his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, {{or at least that}} Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough."

[...] He said Daredevil, like Jessica Jones, [...] "feels like a show that is constantly evolving, and consistently searching for challenges." [...] Cabin also felt that [...] "the show’s use of sound and image to infer or suggest {{as much as any}} line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin."

[...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it [...] "excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung." ...|$|E
