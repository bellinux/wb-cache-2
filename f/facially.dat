5|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003), {{all of the}} elves (including Wood Elves) {{are portrayed}} as fair, graceful, and wise beings with supernatural {{abilities}} like enhanced eyesight. While they <b>facially</b> resemble humans, they transcend beauty, with much longer and finer hair and an apparent inner glow. They also have pointed ears and no facial hair.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court, {{applying}} the Central Hudson standards in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (1986), affirmed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's conclusion that Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948, including the regulations thereunder, was not <b>facially</b> unconstitutional. The lax interpretation of Central Hudson adopted by Posadas was soon restricted under 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996), when the Court invalidated a Rhode Island law prohibiting {{the publication of}} liquor prices.|$|E
5|$|Genelia D'Souza {{was chosen}} to play the female lead Hasini, reprising her role from the {{original}} film. Prakash Raj, who also acted in the original film, {{was chosen to}} reprise {{his role as the}} protagonist's father and Geetha was signed to play the character's mother. Former cricketer Sadagoppan Ramesh made his acting debut in this film, playing Santosh's elder brother. Raja felt he <b>facially</b> resembled Ravi. Sayaji Shinde was signed to play Hasini's father. Kirat Bhattal was selected to play Santosh's fiancée. Actors Kausalya, Santhanam, Premgi Amaren, Srinath and Sathyan, were also added to the cast. Anu Hasan makes a special appearance as a woman who Santosh converses with at the beginning, and end of the film.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition that the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) was <b>facially</b> invalid in prohibiting virtual or cartoon child pornography. The {{basis for the}} ruling was that the CPPA made {{unlawful}} some forms of protected First Amendment speech, banning depictions of sex between children even if not obscene and not involving real child victims. Under New York v. Ferber, if the depiction is of real child abuse or a real child victim, {{as a result of}} photographing a live performance, for instance, then it is not protected speech. Under Miller v. California, obscene speech is likewise excluded from First Amendment protection. The CPPA made all virtual child sex depictions illegal without regard to whether the speech was protected or not, so that part of the statute was struck down as <b>facially</b> invalid.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the filming}} of Hannibal, Reeve was offered the part of primary {{antagonist}} Mason Verger, based on {{his work as a}} wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion. Not having read the novel, Reeve was initially enthusiastic about the opportunity. However, upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, <b>facially</b> disfigured child rapist, Reeve withdrew from the project in disgust. The role was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman.|$|E
25|$|The plaintiffs {{were five}} {{abortion}} clinics, {{a class of}} physicians who provided abortion services, and one physician representing himself independently. They filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the state from enforcing the five provisions and have them declared <b>facially</b> unconstitutional. The District Court, after a three-day bench trial, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them.|$|E
25|$|In the surgeries—closed {{rhinoplasty}} {{and open}} rhinoplasty—an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), a maxillofacial surgeon (jaw, face, and neck specialist), or {{a plastic surgeon}} creates a functional, aesthetic, and <b>facially</b> proportionate nose by separating the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilaginous nasal framework, correcting them as required for form and function, suturing the incisions, using tissue glue and applying either a package or a stent, or both, to immobilize the corrected nose to ensure the proper healing of the surgical incision.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, 2015, {{forensic}} specialists identified 28 of the 43 bodies. Some of {{the family}} members complained that the victims were <b>facially</b> unrecognizable and questioned the official version of the events. An unnamed state official from Michoacán who was not authorized to speak with the press confirmed that all the victims were male and between 25 and 45 years old, and that most of them were native of Ocotlán, Jalisco. Others were from the State of Mexico, Michoacán, Aguascalientes, Coahuila, Sonora, and Tabasco. By May 25, 36 bodies had been handed over to their respective family members. Two days later, 38 bodies had been identified. For the four remaining bodies, Michoacán state authorities carried out DNA tests to the family members {{in order to determine the}} identities. One of the four corpses, however, was severely burned and physically unrecognizable.|$|E
25|$|The video {{depicts the}} Yojiro Noda at night {{time in a}} playground, as he pushes a girl with a {{blindfold}} and headphones in a wheelchair through the park. The girl holds a flash light as they move. Through the park, the pair pass a <b>facially</b> deformed man and men who are fighting. Further through the park is a makeshift slum, where they pas a man on fire. The sky begins to dawn, and the people around Noda and the girl are shot. A man sets a car on fire, and is later shot down {{by a group of}} men with guns. Near the end of the song, the pair come up to a pile of bodies and severed limbs, along with people crying over their bodies. The rest of the band members perform the song in this scene. Noda leaves the girl to close the eyes of a dead boy, and covers him with his jacket. The girl gets up from her wheelchair, and drops her flash light. She screams, removing her headphones and blindfold to reveal that her eyes have been sewn shut.|$|E
25|$|The nasofrontal angle, {{between the}} frontal bone and the nasion usually is 120 degrees; the nasofrontal angle is more acute {{in the male}} face than in the female face. The nasofacial angle, {{the slope of the}} nose {{relative}} to the plane of the face, is approximately 30–40 degrees. The nasolabial angle, the slope between the columella and the philtrum, is approximately 90–95 degrees in the male face, and approximately 100–105 degrees in the female face. Therefore, when observing the nose in profile, the normal show of the columella (the height of the visible nasal aperture) is 2mm; and the dorsum should be rectilinear (straight). When observed from below (worm’s-eye view), the alar base configures an isosceles triangle, with its apex at the infra-tip lobule, immediately beneath the tip of the nose. The <b>facially</b> proportionate projection of the nasal tip (the distance of the nose’s tip from the face) is determined with the Goode Method, wherein the projection of the nasal tip should be 55–60 per cent of the distance between the nasion (nasofrontal junction) and the tip-defining point. A columellar double break might be present, marking the transition between the intermediate crus of the lower-lateral cartilage and the medial crus.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel {{fights and}} kills the Fallen Ahriman (Kevin Copeland), then returns to Michael's {{apartment}} where he sketches {{a picture of}} Amitiel. At the same time Gabriel begins his campaign against the Fallen, the Fallen Lilith (Erika Heynatz) kills Uriel, Asmodeus kills Ithuriel, and Sammael kills Raphael. Driven mad by anger, Gabriel’s eyes turn bright brown, the colour of the Fallen. He returns to the brothel seeking revenge against Asmodeus, randomly killing anyone he finds behind a hotel room door. He eventually finds Asmodeus and discovers that he's using his nigh unconscious female sex slave, whom of which he's been consistently and forcibly giving plastic surgery to {{in an effort to}} make her <b>facially</b> identical to himself so as to satisfy his narcissism, as a hostage. Asmodeus takes Gabriel's shock and sympathy toward the girl to his advantage, discards her and begins assaulting Gabriel. Gabriel gains the advantage in the fight, viciously scars Asmodeus thus enraging him and then kills him. Gabriel halts his own imminent fall when he heals and restores the young woman held captive by Asmodeus to return her to her original appearance and depleting the anesthetics given to her. Shocked by his near fall, Gabriel returns to Amitiel. Amitiel comforts Gabriel and they strip naked before copulating. Gabriel then travels to a nightclub and kills Lilith, injecting her with several full vials of Ahriman's drugs. Gabriel chases Sammael to the nightclub’s rooftop.|$|E
500|$|Justice Robert R. Thomas {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} a unanimous court. [...] Thomas first disposed of the standing argument by the state, noting that Aguilar was not challenging the statute as applied, but was arguing that the statute was <b>facially</b> unconstitutional since it did not provide for any person to legally bear arms. [...] Since anyone could challenge the constitutionality of a statute when they were charged with violating it, even without admitting the underlying conduct, the state's argument was without merit.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1990, Cher {{served as}} a donor and as the National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson for the Children's Craniofacial Association, whose mission is to [...] "empower and give hope to <b>facially</b> {{disfigured}} children and their families". The annual Cher's Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients, their siblings and parents an opportunity to interact with others who have endured similar experiences. She supports and promotes Get A-Head Charitable Trust, which aims {{to improve the quality}} of life for people with head and neck diseases.|$|E
500|$|She made a {{comeback}} in 1939 with {{her role as}} home-wrecker Crystal Allen in The Women opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. [...] A year later, she played against type, playing the unglamorous role of Julie in Strange Cargo (1940), her eighth and final film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a <b>facially</b> disfigured blackmailer in A Woman's Face (1941), a remake of the Swedish film En kvinnas ansikte which had starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, her performance was hailed by many critics.|$|E
500|$|<b>Facially,</b> Bond {{resembles the}} composer, singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael. In Casino Royale Vesper Lynd remarks, [...] "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, {{but there is}} {{something}} cold and ruthless." [...] Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is [...] "certainly good-looking... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold." [...] Others, such as journalist Ben Macintyre, identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond. General references in the novels describe Bond as having [...] "dark, rather cruel good looks".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, two federal {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} in the Southern District of Illinois and the Central District of Illinois. [...] In both cases, the plaintiffs claimed that AUUF statute violated the Second Amendment in {{that it did not}} allow any method for a citizen to bear arms outside the home. [...] Mary Shepard argued that the statutes were <b>facially</b> unconstitutional, while Michael Moore argued that the statutes were unconstitutional as applied. [...] In both cases, the judges granted the state's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that the Second Amendment only protected the right to possess arms in the home. [...] Both Moore and Shepard appealed their cases to the Seventh Circuit, where the cases were consolidated.|$|E
500|$|The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits {{states from}} {{enacting}} laws that abridge {{the freedom of}} speech. Municipal governments may not [...] "restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content". Laws that regulate speech based on the expressive content of the speech are presumptively unconstitutional; such restrictions are only permissible when they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. For {{the purposes of the}} First Amendment, government regulation of speech is considered [...] "content-based" [...] when it targets speech because of ideas or messages that are expressed. Furthermore, some laws may still be considered [...] "content-based" [...] even though they appear to be <b>facially</b> content-neutral. Laws are considered [...] "content-based" [...] if they cannot be [...] "justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech" [...] or if they were adopted [...] "because of disagreement with the message [...] conveys".|$|E
500|$|With the Times ridiculing {{belief in}} the Pig-faced Lady, rival {{newspapers}} set out to defend her honour {{and that of the}} man who wished to marry her. The Morning Herald and Morning Chronicle both published the advertisement from her prospective suitor. The editor of the Morning Chronicle announced that, in his opinion, the advertisement from the [...] "desperate fortune-hunter" [...] had not been immoral or indecent, and thus in his opinion {{there was no reason to}} decline to publish it. He went on to say that while deformities of this nature were unknown to doctors, it was certainly possible that a <b>facially</b> disfigured woman existed and that her deformities had been exaggerated in accounts; he also chided the Times for not returning the payment for the rejected advertisement. The Morning Herald, meanwhile, speculated that the Pig-faced Lady's deformities may have been caused by her mother's [...] "force of imagination, in consequence of a dog having suddenly leaped on her".|$|E
500|$|March 2013 saw {{the release}} of Dead Man Down, a thriller {{directed}} by Niels Arden Oplev reuniting Farrell with Terrence Howard {{for the first time}} since Hart's War ten years earlier. Noomi Rapace, star of Oplev's The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, starred as a <b>facially</b> scarred woman who blackmails Farrell's character into killing the man who disfigured her in a car crash. Reviews were mixed, with Empire calling the film [...] "a pleasingly intricate double (or is it triple?) revenge plot anchored by excellent acting" [...] and The Hollywood Reporter saying that [...] " [...] Wyman's script and the measured pace don't lend themselves to the necessary escalating tension that would have resulted in a more rewarding climax." [...] The New York Times Manola Dargis called the film a failure, but said of the actor: [...] "Farrell and his sensitive, hardworking eyebrows help keep it from becoming a full-bore lampoon." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News also disliked the film; it contained [...] "a lot to roll your eyes over" [...] and, while Farrell was commendable, he was [...] "as stoic as a statue".|$|E
500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to <b>facially</b> resemble Reeve.|$|E
500|$|The Billboard {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review for its moving story of true love {{shown by the}} actors playing the blind wife and <b>facially</b> disfigured husband. The reviewer {{also noted that the}} photography was up to the usual high standard of Thanhouser releases. The Moving Picture World opened with the declaration that, [...] "When this picture is past, the wonder will linger long in the memory whether the wife would have loved her husband just the same if she had seen him in the short time when her affliction was alleviated. And it must be admitted that the producers have added materially to the dramatic interest of the film by leaving that question unanswered." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror review praised the film for its photography, setting and acting, but highlighted technical inconsistencies in the progression of the fire and the overly drawn out struggle of the father in the smoke. Walton of The Moving Picture News also praised the film, stating that [...] "The situations are well handled; the acting of the principals shows the true grip of the characters. The work of this firm of late has been not only artistic but throbbing with that clean, human life which is winning high praise." [...] In local papers, the film was reviewed positively by theater advertisements, owing to the sentimental nature of the film and the technical execution of the fire scene.|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, <b>facially</b> expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Applying these {{principles}} to the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, the Court {{concluded that the}} ordinance was <b>facially</b> unconstitutional. Justice Scalia explained the rationale, writing, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{appeals court}} {{had not done}} that in this case, Marshall wrote. It had found the {{ordinance}} vague based on a review of only some of its possible applications. [...] "Under a proper analysis," [...] Marshall began, [...] "the ordinance is not <b>facially</b> invalid." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of December 2014, forty-two {{states had}} bans on late-term {{abortion}}s {{that were not}} <b>facially</b> unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade or enjoined by court order. In addition, the Supreme Court {{in the case of}} Gonzales v. Carhart ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, [...] "both previability and postviability", as it had done in banning intact dilation and extraction with the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} the Act is <b>facially</b> invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose (first part of the above Lemon test), since (a) the Act does not further its stated secular purpose of [...] "protecting {{academic}} freedom", and (b) the Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.|$|E
2500|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{filed an}} amicus brief that {{supported}} the decision, saying that [...] "section 203 should now be struck down as <b>facially</b> unconstitutional", though membership was split over {{the implications of the}} ruling and its board sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance for further consideration. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Petitioner {{argued that}} the Chaplinsky {{formulation}} should be narrowed, such that the ordinance would be invalidated as [...] "substantially overbroad," [...] but the Court declined to consider this argument, concluding that even {{if all of the}} expression reached by the ordinance was proscribable as [...] "fighting words," [...] the ordinance was <b>facially</b> unconstitutional in that it prohibited otherwise permitted speech {{solely on the basis of}} the subjects the speech addressed.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{a person}} {{suffering}} from somnambulism, a fugue, a metabolic disorder, epilepsy, or other convulsive or reflexive disorder, who kills another, steals another's property, or engages in other <b>facially</b> criminal conduct, {{may not have}} committed an actus reus, for such conduct may have been elicited unconsciously, and [...] "one who engages in what would otherwise be criminal conduct is not guilty of a crime if he does so {{in a state of}} unconsciousness" [...] Depending on jurisdiction, automatism may be a defense distinct from insanity or a species of it.|$|E
2500|$|In his Section 15 analysis, Cory {{disputes}} {{that this was}} a case revolving around the concept of [...] "adverse effect discrimination", that is a neutral law which discriminates against a group only by the effect of the same application. Rather, Cory contends that the law being challenged, the definition of [...] "spouse" [...] in lieu of section 2 of the Old Age Security Act [...] "is, quite simply, not <b>facially</b> neutral" [...] at all. Rather, since the impugned Act defines a spouse only in opposite sex terms, it [...] "draws a clear distinction between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{also argued}} that the Court {{addressed}} a question not raised by the litigants when it found BCRA§203 to be <b>facially</b> unconstitutional, and that the majority [...] "changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law". He argued that the majority had expanded the scope beyond the questions presented by the appellant and that therefore a sufficient record for judging the case did not exist. Stevens argued that at a minimum the Court should have remanded {{the case for a}} fact-finding hearing, and that the majority did not consider other compilations of data, such as the Congressional record for justifying BCRA §203.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, Citizens United filed a {{complaint}} in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of several statutory provisions governing [...] "electioneering communications". It {{asked the court to}} declare that the prohibition corporate and union funding were <b>facially</b> unconstitutional, and also as applied to Hillary: The Movie, and to enjoin the Federal Election Commission from enforcing its regulations. Citizens United also argued that the Commission's disclosure and disclaimer requirements were unconstitutional as applied to the movie pursuant to the Supreme Court decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.. [...] It also sought to enjoin funding, disclosure and disclaimer requirements as applied to Citizens United’s intended ads for the movie.|$|E
2500|$|Beards {{have become}} a {{recurring}} theme during TMS commentary, {{under the supervision of}} [...] "Bearders" [...] himself — scorer and statistician. The TMS team receive sporadic missives from Keith Flett, social historian, serial newspaper letter writer and chairman of the Beard Liberation Front, a group dedicated to the removal of a societal prejudice against the <b>facially</b> follically enhanced or bearded. Flett offers his opinions on the state of beards in the game today and his views are frequently discussed on TMS, particularly by Jonathan Agnew, including transformations in the recent and bygone Pakistan cricketers, and most recently with regards to the [...] "splendidly hirsute" [...] Monty Panesar. Bill Frindall was announced [...] "Beard of the Year" [...] winner in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Petitioner {{moved to}} dismiss the count under the Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance {{on the ground that}} it was {{substantially}} overbroad and impermissibly content based, and therefore <b>facially</b> invalid under the First Amendment. [...] The trial court granted the motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, rejecting petitioner's overbreadth claim because, as the Minnesota Court had construed the Ordinance in prior cases, the phrase [...] "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others" [...] limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounted to fighting words under the Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire decision. [...] The Minnesota Court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based, because [...] "the ordinance is a narrowly tailored means towards accomplishing the compelling governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order." [...] Petitioner appealed, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
2500|$|In Lee v. Department of Justice (2005), Garland dissented {{from the}} denial of {{rehearing}} en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the Wen Ho Lee investigation. Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to [...] "weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure" [...] and that this [...] "undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'" [...] In Initiative & Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature-gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment. Garland found the regulation to be <b>facially</b> overbroad and not narrowly tailored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{victim was}} a young adult, between {{eighteen}} and twenty-two years of age.
