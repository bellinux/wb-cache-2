5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> Game 6 {{to defeat the}} Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick {{to draw attention to}} Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having one of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E

He received the votes of four delegates.

5|$|The Second Mithridatic War {{began when}} Rome tried to annex a {{province}} that Mithridates claimed as <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> the Third Mithridatic War, first Lucius Licinius Lucullus and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates and his Armenian ally Tigranes the Great. Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time Battle of the Lycus.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} farms, Edward {{continued}} his education on <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> 1858, {{he began working}} part-time at the Academy of Natural Sciences, reclassifying and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results in January 1859. Cope began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher. Though Alfred resisted his son's pursuit of a science career, he paid for his son's private studies. Instead of working the farm his father bought for him, Edward rented out the land and used the income to further his scientific endeavors.|$|E

5|$|After Fulin came {{to rule on}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> 1651, {{his mother}} the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang {{arranged}} for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he {{was not allowed to}} demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the point of contact for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> dealings with more senior British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Charles VII {{spent most}} of his three-year reign as emperor {{residing}} in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father's electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in the pending imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> 1777.|$|E

5|$|During William John's absence {{the estate}} was managed by his brother, Canon George Bankes, who {{inherited}} {{it on his}} brother's death just a year before <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> 1857. His youngest grandson Walter Ralph inherited the estate in 1869, and later in life married Henrietta, and had a son Henry John Ralph Bankes. After Walter's death in 1902, his widow undertook the last major developments to the estate, including construction of the church (1907), new entrance lodges (1912–13) and numerous estate cottages. In 1923 control passed to Ralph Bankes, the seven times great-grandson of the original creator. During the Second World War an extensive military encampment {{was established in the}} south-east quarter of the park, which was only restored after the National Trust took ownership. Ralph Bankes died in 1981 and the Kingston Lacy estate, including 12 working farms, and Corfe Castle were bequeathed to the National Trust. The gift was formally accepted on 19 August 1982, the largest bequest that it had ever accepted.|$|E

Gibbs rose quickly to chair the Colorado Senate's Transportation Committee, but {{announced that he would}} seek election to a Summit County Commissioner seat in 2010 rather than run for another term in the legislature. Gibbs was elected a Summit County Commissioner in 2010 and has been serving in that office since then.|$|E
5|$|In July 1961, Sutcliffe {{decided to}} leave the group to {{continue}} painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass guitar of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> June 1961, but specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change the strings around or restring the instrument, so McCartney had to play the bass as it was.

5|$|Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.

Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after the events of Iron Man, Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government {{to hand over the}} Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist Ivan Vanko has developed the same technology and built weapons of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process joining forces with Stark's business rival, Justin Hammer.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Chicago, Brundage {{accepted}} a position as construction superintendent for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, the Monroe Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck out on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had {{ceased to be a}} track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game out of two against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing, which he considered the artistic process, while the inking was more of a craft.|$|E

Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to have an interest of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the Anglican {{authorities}} officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, {{and was one of the}} first High Church Anglicans to write <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E
