30|$|In {{the daytime}} driving period, {{experienced}} drivers’ average duration of fixations decreased smoothly by 261.2  % {{from an average}} of 475.6  ms (P <  0.01) 250  m before tunnel entrance to an average of 131.7  ms (P <  0.01) 50  m inside the tunnel, which indicates that these drivers enhanced their focus upon entering the tunnel environment. The average duration of fixations increases gradually soon afterwards to an average of 166.4  ms (P <  0.05) at 110  m inside the tunnel, then decreases to an average of 143.4  ms (P <  0.01) at 170  m, and finally remains constant at an average of 140  ms (P <  0.05). During the night driving period, the average duration of fixations at all three tunnel <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> is lower than that during the daytime, but it follows a similar decrease–increase–decrease pattern.|$|R
30|$|Drivers need to {{interpret}} real time {{information related to}} their task in able to judge the current situation, make proper decisions and adjust driving behavior accordingly. While driving, more than 80  % of information, especially the dynamic incentives, is perceived through the driver’s visual movements, which mainly include fixation (eye movement speed < 30 °/s and acceleration < 8000 °/s 2), saccade (eye movement speed > 30 °/s or acceleration > 8000 °/s 2) and blinking. During the normal driving process, drivers obtain nearly all of their information related to driving safety through fixations and saccades. Since a driver’s blinking behavior provides relatively little information compared to fixations and saccades, it {{is not included in}} this study. The difference in alignment design and illumination layout is quite significant, which increases the difficulty of the driver’s visual perception and may eventually lead to unsafe driving behaviors or even fatal crashes, especially at tunnel <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> (Calvi and D’Amico 2013; Du et al. 2014 a).|$|R
40|$|Summary The method {{described}} to derive the luminance in the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone</b> of tunnels {{has been based}} on physiological considerations of the adaptational processes taking place when approaching a tunnel. The driver’s adaptation can be sufficiently approximated by the luminance prevailing in the entrance he is fixating and the superimposed equivalent veiling luminance Lseq caused by the surrounding field. The required luminance level in the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone</b> can be obtained by postulating that a 10 ’ object of a defined contrast should be visible as the straylight reduces the contrast {{in the eye of the}} approaching driver. Additional investigations were carried out in which the observer had to evaluate subjectively the entrance luminance in simulated tunnel scenes because it was uncertain what contrast of the object could serve to sufficiently describe the visual task. It was shown that levels rated to provide between fair and good safety conditions almost coincided with the visibility of 10 ’ target with C = 0. 25. With this criterion the required entrance luminance L 2 results as a rule o...|$|E
40|$|A {{permeable}} reactive barrier (PRB) {{was installed}} in the Shoalhaven Floodplain about 100 km south of Sydney (Australia), where acidic groundwater generation from pyritic soil poses a severe environmental and socioeconomic problem. Recycled concrete aggregates were a promising source of alkalinity-generating material and adopted as the reactive media for this PRB. The current study simulates {{the performance of the}} PRB through coupling geochemical reactions involved with recycled concrete and acidic groundwater with geohydraulics (transient groundwater flows). This is the first such attempt made for time-dependent modelling and performance verification of a PRB located in acid sulfate soil (ASS) terrain. The developed model describes the chemical clogging due to mineral precipitates and the associated reductions in porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the reactive medium. The governing equations of the model were incorporated into commercial software, MODFLOW and RT 3 D. The field results are in favourable agreement with the model predictions, confirming that the reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to mineral precipitation occurs predominantly at the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone</b> of the PRB and insignificantly in the middle and exit zones after 7 years of operation. Mineralogical analysis undertaken on sample specimens from the PRB also confirms that clogging is minimal at the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the distribution of}} the terrestrial isopod Hyloniscus adonis (Verhoeff, 1927) in croatia. It was recorded {{for the first time at}} the edge of Dubravica peat bog and the adjacent forest. Additionally, it was collected at the edges of Đon močvar peat bog. Revision of the terrestrial isopod collection of the Croatian Biospeleological Society revealed that this species also occurs in central and eastern part of Croatia. Our results reveal that H. adonis is a hygrophilic species inhabiting various types of forests in the colline and montane belts. It prefers humid soils with thick litter and humus layers and most probably seldom leaves its shelter. H. adonis is extremely rare in open bog habitats, most likely due to the harsh environmental conditions (e. g. high soil humidity, low pH values) and can be considered as a tyrphoxenous species. Additionally, it was also found in the <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> of caves, most likely due to the favourable microclimatic conditions. It seems to be a temporary cave dwelle...|$|R

40|$|Many speleothems {{in caves}} on Cayman Brac and Isla de Mona have {{suffered}} considerable dissolution. It {{is suggested that}} this is a consequence of condensation corrosion rather than of aqueous flooding of the entire cave. A program of temperature and relative humidity measurements during the rainy seasons showed that the <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> are areas of comparatively large diurnal variation where condensation from warm air onto cooler walls may occur. Artificial condensation was induced using ice bottles: chem-ical analysis of the condensation waters determined that they were generally undersaturated with respect to calcite and/or dolomite but that this changes over space and time. Gypsum tablets were suspended inside three sample caves on Cayman Brac and one on Isla de Mona for 16 and 13 months, respective-ly. At the end of this period, tablets close to the entrances and to the floor were found to have under-gone considerable dissolution; this could only have been the result of condensation corrosion Where water condensing onto cave walls in soluble rocks is undersaturated with respect to the mineral (calcite, dolomite, gypsum, etc.), the potential exists for dissolution to occur; the process is termed “condensation corrosion ” (Ford & Williams 1989 : 309). It may create some characteristic speleogen fea...|$|R

The deepest color in the bed was observed at the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone</b> with the color front progressing with impregnation time. Because of the strong alumina–CPA interaction, the beneath layers of support adsorbed more platinum and its concentration in the impregnating solution rapidly approached zero along the bed. With time and continuous passage of impregnating solution over the catalyst bed and subsequent adsorption and desorption, the platinum re-distributed along the support bed until a more uniform platinum distribution was obtained. The re-distribution of Pt {{is a consequence of}} equilibrium nature of its adsorption being facilitated in the presence of competitive ions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractArticle {{presents}} media solutions providing new materiality {{of architectural}} spaces. Media solutions in architecture evolve in new forms. Article presents both {{the development of}} new technological solutions as well as new ways of application of media solutions in relation to architectural form. The aim of the article is to show technical aspects of new materiality - intelligent materials, allowing transmission of changeable visual content (like powerglass, GKD mediamesh, IMAGIC WEAVE, TEXLON lexipix, ETTLIN lux, OLED technology) and interaction between a user and space, so as spatial aspects of this new materiality. The goal of the article is to stress that media solutions do not stay just in the vertical position of a media façade, but go deeper in the users’ environment creating digital canopies (called in the article “media umbrellas”) and complex media environments. “Media umbrellas” due to their horizontal positions make boundaries between private and public space, indoor and outdoor zones, more fluid. Depending on context they can serve various functions. They follow pedestrians, eliminate monotony of long walkways, indicate <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> and cover places making them more cosy and more unusual. These structures can constitute fixed elements of architectural surroundings and take part in temporary events, provoking discussions and showing new possibilities.

40|$|The re-development of the MMC site {{is focused}} on {{improving}} the urban situation for the local residents, both functional and spatial. Many of them belong to the category disadventaged people in terms of education and employment. The new pedestrian lane {{through the middle of}} the site, bridges the two local village centres and gives the opportunity to grow one stronger center, with a functional division of a commercial, educational and flexible zone. The industrial site is spatially manipulated, to make pedestrian routing both fluent and tactile. Therefor, interiors of factories are used to create more intimate urban space, so that a network of spatial sequences arises. In these urban interiors, industrial materialization and structures are emphasized with green, light and shadows, creating interesting <b>entrance</b> <b>zones</b> and short-cuts where people become more aware of the historical time-layers and values, generating inspiring learning environments. The Grillas Warehouse is the main building of the New Opportunity Education Centre, which is also further elaborated.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{nonlinearity}} observed in Bagley plots of thermotropic copolyesters has been investigated experimentally. With {{the aid of a}} two-piston slit rheometer the dependence of the viscosity on the hydrostatic pressure has been determined directly. This dependence only accounts for part of the nonlinearity of the Bagley plots. Using slit dies with either a convergent or a divergent entrance, concave as well as convex pressure profiles are obtained. This can only be explained by a change in the molecular orientation induced by the flow in the <b>entrance</b> <b>zone.</b> The presence of wall effects has been evaluated by measuring the pressure profiles in slits of different heights; it does not explain the nonlinearity of the Bagley plots.
