5|$|Taylor {{was indicted}} as an {{accessory}} in {{the assassination of}} Goebel. He fled to Indianapolis, where the governor refused to extradite <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>least</b> one attempt to abduct him by force failed in 1901. Despite being pardoned in 1909 by Republican Governor Augustus E. Willson, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for the entire season. His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> half of the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared {{in his first game}} one week after the season started.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} biographies and many works of art. Voltaire, who saw Poniatowski as a model reformist, modeled King Teucer in his drama Les Lois de Minos (1772) after <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> <b>least</b> 58 contemporary poems were dedicated to him or praised him. Since then, he has been a major character in many works of Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, in the Rok 1794 trilogy by Władysław Stanisław Reymont, in the novels of Tadeusz Łopalewski, and in the dramas of Ignacy Grabowski, Tadeusz Miciński, Roman Bradstaetter and Bogdan Śmigielski. He is discussed in Luise Mühlbach's novel Joseph II and His Court, and appears in Jane Porter's Thaddeus of Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|Around 2:45 a.m., Kelly was {{on patrol}} and stopped to {{investigate}} a broken-down car {{on the side of}} the road, which was idling with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle. Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun. Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> twice, killing him. Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but {{did not do so}} for fear of ambush. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to hold the line against a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E

5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> part of the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before {{he took out his}} revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E
