5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2003: The {{first version}} {{to have become}} {{available}} in English and French, {{as well as the}} original German language. It consists of 16 individual tools accessible through the Start Center, as well as the Windows start menu. It includes features to clean the hard disks, clean and <b>defragment</b> the Windows Registry, optimize Windows and Internet connection settings and change {{the look and feel of}} Windows. It also provides features targeted at users with an intermediate or advanced level of computer knowledge that enables them to edit the registry, manage running processes, uninstall programs, shred and undelete files, and display system information. In addition to the previously-supported Windows 95 and Windows 98, TuneUp Utilities 2003 also supports Windows 2000, Me and Windows XP.|$|E
2500|$|When the [...] "Fix Errors" [...] button is selected, FakeSysdef {{pretends to}} scan and <b>defragment</b> the hard disk. It then {{displays}} more fake error messages, {{and tells the}} user {{that he needs to}} purchase an [...] "Advanced Module" [...] for the fix. If the user chooses to do so, the browser opens. It will open a custom web browser where the user can input card information to buy the software.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} to daylight the southern portion of Tibbetts Brook back onto the surface, and to restore and <b>defragment</b> the portions of the stream within Van Cortlandt Park. Proposals to daylight the stream have existed since the 1990s. Around [...] of fresh water from the brook enter the sewer system on a daily basis, a total of [...] annually. The additional water from the brook also contributes to the further overflowing of raw sewage into the Harlem River during rainy conditions. Meanwhile, the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park leads to the flooding of recreational areas within the park.|$|E
2500|$|Flash drives can be <b>defragmented.</b> There is a {{widespread}} opinion that <b>defragmenting</b> brings little advantage (as there is no mechanical head that moves from fragment to fragment), and that <b>defragmenting</b> shortens {{the life of the}} drive by making many unnecessary writes. [...] However, some sources claim that <b>defragmenting</b> a flash drive can improve performance (mostly due to improved caching of the clustered data), and the additional wear on flash drives may not be significant.|$|R
5000|$|When required, {{the program}} checks the volume for errors before <b>defragmenting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Defragmenting</b> NTFS volumes with cluster sizes {{larger than}} 4 {{kilobytes}} (KB) is not possible.|$|R
50|$|Contig is {{designed}} to <b>defragment</b> individual files, or specified groups of files, and does not attempt to move files {{to the beginning of}} the partition. Unlike the Windows built-in defragmenter tool, Contig can <b>defragment</b> individual files, individual directories, and subsets of the file system using wildcards.|$|E
50|$|As of Windows 10, {{the program}} has been renamed to <b>Defragment</b> and Optimize Drives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defragment</b> {{hard drives}} {{to reduce the}} drive heads' need to search widely for data. This can also improve performance.|$|E
5000|$|AmigaOS 4.0 {{introduced}} a new system for allocating RAM and <b>defragmenting</b> physical memory. It still uses flat shared address space that cannot be <b>defragmented.</b> It is based on slab allocation method and paging memory that allows swapping. Paging was implemented in AmigaOS 4.1 but may lock up system if all physical memory is used up. [...] Swap memory could be activated and deactivated any moment allowing the user to choose to use only physical RAM.|$|R
50|$|PerfectDisk has editions {{designed}} for most user categories, from home PCs to large servers and virtualization-aware editions for virtual environments. In addition to <b>defragmenting</b> files, it also optimizes disk drives with an optimization strategy called SMARTPlacement and it prevents fragmentation with the OptiWrite feature. PerfectDisk <b>defragments</b> data and system files and places {{a high priority}} on free space consolidation. SSD Optimize is an optimization method for solid state drives that focuses on free space consolidation without defragmentation of files.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Windows Vista release, {{only one}} volume could be {{analyzed}} or <b>defragmented</b> {{at a time}} and only one instance could run.|$|R
5000|$|WAFL in NetApp's ONTAP 7.2 {{operating}} system has a command called reallocate {{that is designed}} to <b>defragment</b> large files.|$|E
50|$|The product {{offered a}} wide variety of {{hierarchical}} backups, data streaming, alternating tape drives, and an ability to <b>defragment</b> minidisks.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the end of 1982, the IBM PC DOS {{operating}} system that shipped with early IBM Personal Computers included a Disk Volume Organization Optimizer to <b>defragment</b> the 5Â¼-inch floppy disks that those machines used. Microsoft's MS-DOS did not <b>defragment</b> hard disks. Several third party software developers marketed defragmenters to fill this gap. MS-DOS 6.0 introduced Defrag. Windows NT, however, did not offer a Defrag utility, and Symantec was suggested as a possible source of the utility.|$|E
50|$|A {{small change}} to the Windows {{registry}} allows entire folders to be <b>defragmented</b> from Windows Explorer. New unfragmented files with specified name and length can be created.|$|R
50|$|JkDefrag {{runs on the}} Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista Operating Systems, and <b>defragments</b> both FAT and NTFS filesystems. It {{uses the}} {{standard}} Windows defragmentation API. User support was provided through web-based forums.|$|R
50|$|The HFS Plus {{file system}} transparently <b>defragments</b> files {{that are less}} than 20 MiB in size and are broken into 8 or more fragments, when the file is being opened.|$|R
5000|$|PageDefrag runs on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. Though {{the website}} erroneously says [...] "runs on Windows XP (32-bit) and higher (32-bit), Windows Server 2003 (32-bit) and higher (32-bit)", the tool cannot <b>defragment</b> the pagefile on Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Server 2008; it {{is able to}} <b>defragment</b> {{registry}} hives on these versions. Workarounds for higher versions of Windows, including 64-bit versions, include using a BartPE disk or booting from a Windows install CD and using the provided command line interface.|$|E
5000|$|Disk Defragmenter can be {{configured}} {{to automatically}} <b>defragment</b> {{the hard drive}} on a regular basis. It features cancellable, low I/O priority, shadow copy-aware defragmentation. It can also <b>defragment</b> the NTFS Master File Table (MFT). The user interface has been simplified, with the color graph, progress indicator and other information such as file system, free space etc., being removed entirely. Chunks of data over 64MB in size will not be defragmented; Microsoft has stated that this is {{because there is no}} discernible performance benefit in doing so. The defragmenter is not based on an MMC snap-in. The command line utility defrag.exe offers more control over the defragmentation process. This utility can be used to <b>defragment</b> specific volumes and to just analyze volumes as the defragmenter would in Windows XP. Windows Vista Service Pack 1 adds back the ability to specify which volumes are to be defragmented to the GUI.|$|E
50|$|PerfectDisk {{attempts}} to <b>defragment</b> drives {{in a single}} pass of a drive, as opposed to a common approach of running continuously and gradually defragmenting the file system.|$|E
5000|$|SMARTPlacement is PerfectDisk's {{patented}} default {{method that}} <b>defragments</b> all files, consolidates free space, and optimizes the drive according to file usage. It {{provides the most}} complete defragmentation possible and slows down refragmentation of the drive.|$|R
50|$|UltraDefrag is an {{open-source}} disk <b>defragmenting</b> utility for Microsoft Windows. It {{is released}} under the GNU General Public License. The only other Windows-based defragmentation utility with a GNU GPL was JkDefrag, but its GPL version was discontinued in 2008.|$|R
2500|$|Win32/FakeSysdef {{displays}} numerous false alerts indicating system errors while {{displaying the}} appearance of scanning the hard disk and <b>defragmenting</b> it, then prompts the user, with a [...] "Fix Errors" [...] button, to buy and activate it to fix discovered errors.|$|R
5000|$|It {{does not}} <b>defragment</b> files {{residing}} in the Recycle Bin or files that are in use. In particular, this includes the registry, page file and hibernation file.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{filesystem}} is NTFS, contig {{can also}} analyse and <b>defragment</b> the following files:$mft, $LogFile, $Volume, $Attrdef, $Bitmap, $Boot, $BadClus, $Secure, $UpCase, $ExtendFor instance:contig -v -s $mft ...|$|E
50|$|BricxCC {{has many}} {{utilities}} such as NeXTExplorer (upload/download files, <b>defragment</b> the NXT, use file hex viewer), NeXTScreen (view what's on the NXT's LCD, and capture images and video).|$|E
5000|$|Directories, for example, can be <b>defragmented</b> {{with the}} {{following}} command. This will help speed up accessing files in a directory with many {{hundreds or thousands of}} files.for /R /D %a in (*.*) do start /b contig -q [...] "%a" [...] > nul ...|$|R
5000|$|SSD Optimize consolidates {{free space}} on a Solid State Drive to improve SSD write performance. SSDs are not {{affected}} by file fragmentation like traditional electromechanical disk drives and defragmentation can shorten the lifespan of the SSD. SSD Optimize improves SSD performance without unnecessarily and harmfully <b>defragmenting</b> the drive.|$|R
5000|$|Defrag Only <b>defragments</b> only {{fragmented}} files without {{attempting to}} place files according to usage patterns or attempting to consolidate free space. It provides the fastest defragmentation pass of all PerfectDisk methods {{but is not}} the most thorough and it should only be used if you have lots of free space.|$|R
5000|$|Contig can't <b>defragment</b> files {{accessed}} through directory mount points (as {{opposed to}} drive letter mounts). Using an additional (temporary) drive letter will circumvent this problem. See subst command.|$|E
50|$|Windows 7 reintroduces the analyze {{function}} and showing percent complete of the defragmentation, {{both of which}} were removed in Windows Vista. It can also <b>defragment</b> multiple volumes simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|PageDefrag {{does not}} <b>defragment</b> the {{contents}} of the registry files, only the placement of these files on the hard drive. Other utilities such as NTREGOPT can optimize the registry files.|$|E
50|$|The now {{obsolete}} Commodore Amiga Smart File System (SFS) <b>defragmented</b> itself {{while the}} filesystem was in use. The defragmentation process is almost completely stateless (apart from the location {{it is working}} on), {{so that it can}} be stopped and started instantly. During defragmentation data integrity is ensured for both metadata and normal data.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, <b>defragmenting</b> the {{underlying}} registry files (e.g. using the free Microsoft-supported PageDefrag tool), rather than attempting {{to clean the}} registry's contents, has a measurable benefit and has therefore been recommended in the past by experts such as Mark Russinovich. (A form of defragmentation capability has been built directly into Windows since Vista.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Defragmenting</b> {{these files}} may improve performance. Since PageDefrag only affects a few files, {{it takes a}} {{relatively}} short time to run when compared to entire-disk defragmenters such as Windows Defrag, so long as the page file is not fragmented. If the page file is fragmented, PageDefrag can take as long or longer than Windows Defrag.|$|R
