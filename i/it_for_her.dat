Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices.

5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> benefit.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then {{he should be able}} to feel <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

25|$|Lewis {{was unique}} {{in the way she}} {{approached}} sculpting abroad. She insisted on enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors to do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> which was the common practice. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work. Harriet Hosmer, a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unsolicited works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping.|$|E
25|$|Cinderella finds a gown {{that belongs}} {{to her mother and}} decides to refashion it for the ball, but her step family impedes this by giving her extra chores. Cinderella's animal friends, {{including}} Jaq and Gus, refashion <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively. When Cinderella comes downstairs wearing the dress, the stepsisters are upset when they realize Cinderella is wearing their accessories, and tear the dress to shreds before leaving for the ball with their mother. A heartbroken Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her Fairy Godmother appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella goes to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress into a white ball gown and her shoes into glass slippers. As Cinderella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the stroke of midnight.|$|E
25|$|Ambre had sung Carmen in the Netherlands {{early in}} her career and during the 1879–1880 Mapleson tour, {{but she had never}} sung it in France. The opera had not been seen in Paris since its world premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1875, {{although}} it had several subsequent stagings in the French provinces. Keen to perform it in Paris, she asked Manet to write his friend Antonin Proust and urge him to pressure the Opéra-Comique to revive <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> A Paris revival with Ambre never happened, but she did sing the role again on her 1880–1881 American tour. Scholars differ as to whether the portrait was done at Ambre's request or as a thank-you gesture from Manet for having organized the exhibition of The Execution of Emperor Maximilian the previous year. During the late summer of 1880 Manet wrote to Eva Gonzalès that he would be working on the painting every day as Ambre was leaving for America that October. However, the portrait remained in the artist's possession. It was in the inventory of works inherited by Manet's widow Suzanne on his death in 1883.|$|E
