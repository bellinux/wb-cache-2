50|$|Tests The <b>HI</b> <b>test</b> is {{frequently}} used for detection and quantitation of humoral antibody for PPV. Antibody sometimes {{can be detected}} as early as 5 days after swine are exposed to live virus, and it may persist for years. Sera examined by the <b>HI</b> <b>test</b> are usually pretreated by heat inactivation (56?C, 30 minutes) and by adsorption with erythrocytes (to remove naturally occurring hemagglutinins) and kaolin (to remove or reduce nonantibody inhibitors of HA). Trypsin also {{has been used to}} remove nonantibody inhibitors of HA. Parameters of the <b>HI</b> <b>test</b> have been studied in detail.|$|E
50|$|Pigs nursing immune dams absorb a high titer of {{antibody}} for PPV from colostrum. These titers decrease progressively {{with time}} by dilution as pigs grow {{as well as}} by biological degradation. They usually reach subdetectable levels in 3-6 months if sera are examined by the <b>HI</b> <b>test.</b> Sometimes passively acquired antibody persists for a longer interval. Moreover, levels of antibody too low to be detected by the <b>HI</b> <b>test</b> may be detected by the SN test. The primary significance of passively acquired antibody is that it interferes with the development of active immunity. High levels of such antibody can prevent infection, and lower levels can minimize dissemination from infected pigs. Consequently, some groups of gilts are not fully susceptible to infection and dissemination of virus until either shortly before conception or during early gestation.|$|E
50|$|The SN test is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} detection and quantitation of humoral antibody for PPV.

50|$|Influenza virus C is {{different}} from type A and B in its growth requirements. Because of this it is not isolated and identified as frequently. Diagnosis is by virus isolation, serology, and other tests. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) is one method of serology that detects antibodies for diagnostic purposes. Western blot (immunoblot assay) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are two other methods used to detect proteins (or antigens) in serum. In each of these techniques, the antibodies for the protein of interest are added {{and the presence of}} the specific protein is indicated by a color change. ELISA was shown to have higher sensitivity to the HEF than the <b>HI</b> <b>test.</b> Because only influenza virus C produces esterase, In Situ Esterase Assays provide a quick and inexpensive method of detecting just type C. If more individuals were tested for influenza virus C {{as well as the other}} two types, infections not previously associated with type C may be recognized.|$|E

The evaluations were conducted by comparison with a pseudotyped-based virus neutralization test (H 5 pp VNT) performed in a reference laboratory and considered as a "gold standard" and also by using methods developed for imperfect reference test. Their global accuracy and best cut-offs were also estimated. Results from the <b>HI</b> <b>test</b> for several haemagglutinin subtypes and from a commercial type A influenza competition ELISA were also compared.

40|$|Abstract Background During a {{wildlife}} screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from pools of cloacal swabs of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) {{caught in a}} single sampling site at two different times. AIV and APMV 1 were excluded using hemagglutination inhibition (<b>HI)</b> <b>testing</b> and specific real-time RT-PCR tests. Methods To refine the virological identification of APMV 2 - 10 realized by <b>HI</b> subtyping <b>tests</b> and in lack of validated molecular tests for APMV 2 - 10, random access amplification was used in combination with next generation sequencing for the sequence independent identification of the viruses and the determination of their genomes. Results Three different APMVs were identified. From one pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV 4 was assembled from the random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV 6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, {{as well as a}} partial sequence for an APMV 4. This APMV 4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV 4 isolated from the first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, the HI subtyping revealed APMV 4 and APMV 6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting APMV 4 in the APMV 6 infected pool. Conclusions These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within the serotypes APMV 4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the <b>HI</b> subtyping <b>test.</b> Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, the characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs can be obtained, including the identification of viruses in mixed infections. </p...|$|R

Abuja Municipal, Kuje, Gwagwalada, and Kwali area councils had prevalence of 37, 44, 79, and 68 %, respectively. The overall prevalence of antibody to Newcastle disease in the four area councils was 57 %. This study shows that Newcastle disease virus is circulating in local chickens in the study area, and this may pose a serious threat to the commercial poultry industry within these four area councils of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) where this study {{was carried out}}...|$|R
