40|$|Resource {{isolation}} of the computation and storage in the cloud is relatively mature, but the network resource is still shared among tenants leading to variable and unpredictable network performance when <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantees</b> are not enforced. Currently most of the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantee</b> approaches {{are based on the}} idea of single-path reservation without fully exploiting the multipath resource, which leads to poor network utilization. In this paper, we propose a multi-path <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantee</b> approach called MultiBand, which provides <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantees</b> by allocating <b>bandwidth</b> across multiple paths. We utilize label-based routing technique to explicitly control the packets' transmission paths, and design a MHTB rate limiter model to split and schedule the traffic over the multiple reserved paths. Besides, Our Multiband solution has the work-conserving property. We evaluated our approach through simulations with realistic topologies and typical traffic patterns. Our results show that MultiBand is able to provide multipath <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantees</b> and to achieve higher network utility and tenant throughput compared with those of current approaches. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With wide {{application}} of virtualization technology, tenants {{are able to}} access isolated cloud services by renting the shared resources in datacenters. Unlike resources such as CPU and memory, datacenter network, which relies on traditional transport-layer protocols, suffers unfairness {{due to a lack}} of VMlevel network isolation. In this paper, we propose Falloc, a new bandwidth allocation protocol, towards VM-based fairness across the datacenter with two main objectives: (i) <b>guarantee</b> <b>bandwidth</b> for VMs based on their base bandwidth requirements, and (ii) share residual bandwidth in proportion to weights of VMs. To design Falloc, we model the datacenter bandwidth allocation as a bargaining game and propose a distributed algorithm to achieve the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution (NBS). We apply the theory to practice by implementing Falloc with OpenFlow in experiments under diversed scenarios, which shows that Falloc can achieve fairness by adapting to different network requirements of VMs, and balance the tradeoff between <b>bandwidth</b> <b>guarantee</b> and proportional <b>bandwidth</b> share. By carrying out large scale tracedriven simulations using real-world Mapreduce workload, we show that Falloc achieves high utilization and maintains fairness among VMs in datacenters. I...|$|R

FireWire {{is capable of}} both asynchronous and isochronous transfer methods at once. Isochronous data transfers are transfers for devices that require continuous, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> In an aircraft, for instance, Isochronous devices include control of the rudder, mouse operations and data from pressure sensors outside the aircraft. All these elements require constant, uninterrupted bandwidth. To support both elements, FireWire dedicates a certain percentage to isochronous data and the rest to asynchronous data. In IEEE 1394, 80% of the bus is reserved for isochronous cycles, leaving asynchronous data {{with a minimum of}} 20% of the bus.|$|E

If Internet service providers (ISPs) can provide varying levels of service to websites at various prices, {{this may be a}} way to manage the costs of unused capacity by selling surplus bandwidth (or [...] "leverage price discrimination to recoup costs of 'consumer surplus). However, purchasers of connectivity on the basis of Committed Information Rate or <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bandwidth</b> capacity must expect the capacity they purchase in order to meet their communications requirements. Various studies have sought to provide network providers the necessary formulas for adequately pricing such a tiered service for their customer base. But while network neutrality is primarily focused on protocol based provisioning, most of the pricing models are based on bandwidth restrictions.|$|E
