5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E
5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw {{the ball to the}} plate. The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Baker <b>felt</b> very <b>comfortable,</b> {{but she did}} not {{altogether}} understand her friend's joke.|$|R
50|$|DataCorp, {{fighting}} off a second takeover attempt by CA, <b>felt</b> less <b>comfortable</b> than ever and, {{by the early}} 1980s, discontinued development.|$|R
50|$|The song {{had drawn}} Kipner's {{attention}} to Maurice's {{potential as a}} more than competent songwriter, Maurice generally <b>felt</b> more <b>comfortable</b> writing the music than the words.|$|R
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable,</b> making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, {{but the idea of}} Bart and Lisa {{attending}} a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot, because the writers had not <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series.|$|E
5|$|In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest sound stages (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at Universal Studios) {{were being}} {{prepared}} for the filming of Batman Returns. Filming started in June 1991. Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on Rockefeller Center. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used. Burton {{wanted to make sure}} that the penguins <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable.</b> Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets.|$|E

5|$|Sven-Göran Eriksson {{took over}} from Pearce for the 2007–08 season and, {{following}} a spending spree, Samaras was reportedly deemed surplus to requirements {{by the new}} manager. Samaras' agent Paul Koutsoliakos said that, despite interest from across Europe, his client {{wanted to stay in}} the Premier League and prove his ability. Samaras was linked with a £2.5million move to Middlesbrough {{towards the end of the}} transfer window but ended up staying at City. Eriksson stated that although he was unimpressed with Samaras when he first joined, he felt the player had improved and adapted his style of play a lot during pre-season and that he now <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> keeping him at the club.|$|E
5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E
5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
60|$|At this direct question, Codfish hesitated {{and showed}} that he <b>felt</b> far from <b>comfortable.</b>|$|R
50|$|While the Roosters' {{offer was}} higher, Wing said he <b>felt</b> more <b>comfortable</b> {{accepting}} the Souths offer {{as it was}} a guaranteed four-year deal compared to the Roosters' 2-year deal with an option for a further 2 years.|$|R
50|$|As a youth, Teletović {{spent some}} of his time playing soccer, as well as {{learning}} kickboxing and karate. However, he <b>felt</b> most <b>comfortable</b> with playing basketball, as he played the sport at a local basketball court not far from his home.|$|R
5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> enough with his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
5000|$|F. Scott Fitzgerald {{described}} Quadrangle Club in This Side of Paradise as [...] "Literary Quadrangle."

60|$|A few sips {{of brandy}} soon {{restored}} the circulation which had well-nigh been arrested, {{and when she}} had been clothed in the dry garments, Ailie <b>felt</b> comparatively <b>comfortable,</b> and expressed her thanks to Phil Briant with tears in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Sam had {{bound up}} his burn with a rag {{saturated}} {{with oil and}} flour, and announced that he <b>felt</b> quite <b>comfortable.</b> [...] "But just let me get hold of those Baxters," [...] he added. [...] "I shan't stand on any ceremony with them." ...|$|R
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable,</b> located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Sandy Koufax {{signed a}} ten-year {{contract}} with NBC for $1 million {{to serve as}} a broadcaster on the Saturday Game of the Week. Koufax never <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> being in front of the camera, and quit before the 1973 season.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Montagu {{is noted}} to have sent more letters to Elizabeth Carter {{than to have}} {{received}} them. Montagu was an ardent supporter of Carter despite her friend being of a lower class; Montagu respected Carter's skill and virtue. Montague <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> enough to correspond with Carter about the responsibility of great wealth.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Pickwick drew in {{his head}} again, his countenance was smiling and placid; and, walking quietly back into the office, he {{declared}} that he had now removed a great weight from his mind, and that he <b>felt</b> perfectly <b>comfortable</b> and happy.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} with Orlando, Brek often found himself playing left back. Shortly before new head coach Jason Kreis took over, Shea made {{consecutive}} appearances as a winger, {{a position that}} utilized his speed and height and a position that he <b>felt</b> more <b>comfortable</b> in.|$|R
5000|$|Carter's {{first choice}} for college was the University of Tennessee not Michigan State University. He {{was going to}} go there on a {{football}} scholarship but Carter concluded by saying [...] "I thought it over and concluded that I really <b>felt</b> more <b>comfortable</b> at Michigan State." ...|$|R
25|$|Living {{conditions}} for LGBT {{people have become}} more favourable in recent years with same-sex relationships being accepted in public though some negative conditions remain. A 2015 EU-wide survey, commissioned by the Fundamental Rights Agency, showed that 54% of gay people in Malta <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> holding {{the hand of a}} same-sex partner in public, though only 40% were out at their workplaces.|$|E
25|$|Niki {{grew up in}} {{a strict}} Catholic environment, against which she {{repeatedly}} rebelled. Her mother was temperamental and violent, beating the younger children, and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry. Both Elizabeth and Richard de Saint Phalle, younger siblings, would later commit suicide as adults. The atmosphere at home was tense; the only place where Niki <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> and warm was in the kitchen, overseen by a black cook. Decades later, Niki would reveal that she had suffered years of sexual abuse from her father, starting at the age of 11.|$|E
25|$|The need to {{work closely}} with the Iraqi {{government}} was not something many of shield volunteers <b>felt</b> <b>comfortable</b> with. Some felt that the list delivered by the officials compromised their autonomy. Others felt that they would rather be deployed in schools, hospitals, and orphanages. These shield volunteers left Iraq. The rest took up residence at the sites, a list of which was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff together with a request that they recognize the activists' assertion that targeting these sites would be in violation of Article 54 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention. There was no response to the letters.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow stated [...] "Although {{originally}} associated with Woody Herman and cool jazz, Cohn always <b>felt</b> equally <b>comfortable</b> playing with swing-styled players. His [...] "Natural Seven" [...] looks toward the Kansas City Seven and includes {{two members of}} Count Basie's band".|$|R
60|$|Ormsgill, who did {{not answer}} him, glanced round at his boys. He fancied {{that none of them}} <b>felt</b> exactly <b>comfortable,</b> but they, at least, kept still, and he sent forward two of them with the {{presents}} he had brought before he turned to the Headman.|$|R
25|$|MacDonald {{also made}} a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never <b>felt</b> entirely <b>comfortable</b> in the smoky atmosphere.|$|R
