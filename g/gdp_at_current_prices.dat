40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{summarize}} the approaches used to research the development of business angels activities and venture capital investments according to the development of macroeconomic variables and then consider the possibility of their use in this research in the Czech Republic. Scientific aim: Based on the experience of foreign studies and research the paper explores the possible relationship between venture capital investments and the development of key macroeconomic variables in the Czech Republic. Methodology/methods: To assess the relationship between the level of venture capital investment and macroeconomic variables in the Czech Republic are used statistics of the European Private Equity & Venture Capital Association on investment activity in the Czech Republic, macroeconomic data (the annual change in real GDP, the annual change in real expenditure on gross capital formation, the annual change in real expenditure on fixed capital formation, the ratio of the current account deficit to <b>GDP</b> <b>at</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> and the ratio of financial account balance to <b>GDP</b> <b>at</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices)</b> of the Czech Statistical Office.

At a first step we developed and tested the model without of sample data of Pakistan. For model construction and validation ten years data from the year 1999 and 2002 - 2010 were used and divided into two sub sample - the training sub sample (6 years) of 1999 and 2002 to 2006 and the testing sub sample (4 years) from 2007 to 2010. For bringing more variation in women representation data for the year 1999 was used. Nonexistence of parliament due to martial law was the main reason of the exclusion of years 2000 and 2001 from the analyses. The results of the multiple linear regressions show that model is perfectly fit to predict women representation in Pakistan. Eighty-three percent variation in the response variable (% of women representation) was explained by the model. GDP per capita (0. 47) was found the only significant factor for variation in women representation in Pakistan. In a second step, the robustness of the model was tested by applying it to the Malaysian out of sample data for nine years from 2002 - 2010.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of {{remittances}} on the output per worker in Lithuania over the sample period 1980 – 2012. We use the augmented Solow approach and the ARDL bounds procedure to examine the cointegration relationship and subsequently estimate short-run and long-run effects, and the causality nexus. The data available in the World Bank database for the required variable are relatively small for the analysis. To overcome this constraint, we plot data of the respective variables and use appropriate trend functions to approximate data for missing years. For remittances, we use the exponential trend function as the best fit to approximate data for remittances over the period of 1980 – 1992 and 2012. Similar approach is used to approximate data for <b>GDP</b> (<b>at</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices)</b> {{for the period of}} 1980 – 1989 and gross fixed capital formation for the period of 1980 – 1994 to build the capital stock data. Further, we use the polynomial trend function to approximate data for GDP (constant 2005 USD) for the period of 1980 – 1994. Within the necessary caveats, our results show that output per worker, capital per worker and remittances are cointegrated, and remittances contribute about 0, 02 % and 0, 04 % to output per worker in short-run and long-run, respectively, and the capital share is around 0. 50. We note a bidirectional causation and hence a mutually reinforcing effect between capital per worker and output per worker, and a unidirectional causation from remittances to output per worker, duly supporting the remittances-led growth hypothesis in Lithuania. However, our results are not unambiguous due to data constraints. In this regard, further research will supplement and give more insights to the results and outcomes of this paper...|$|E
40|$|We {{will find}} ways of getting by without cheap oil and coal, argues John Quiggin BACK in July the Howard {{government}} announced, with some fanfare, {{the formation of the}} Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development, a six-country agreement presented variously as an alternative or a complement to the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. The agreement involved no commitment targets for reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, or market-based incentives for more efficient use of energy, preferring instead to focus on technological solutions. No concrete proposals were announced, and observers of the climate change issue have been waiting with interest for the first meeting of the group which, it was announced, would be held in Adelaide in November. Now, however, it appears that the meeting has been postponed or abandoned, and the government is saying there was never a formal commitment to hold such a meeting. The cynical interpretation is obvious enough. The purpose of the pact, in this interpretation, was to prevent action on Kyoto by raising the prospect of alternative initiatives. Holding a meeting requires some actual commitments, and therefore has to be deferred as long as possible. A more charitable interpretation is that, while the major parties were agreed on what {{they did not want to}} do (impose effective targets for reducing emissions), they have found it more difficult to reach an agreement on what they do want to do. While we wait to see what, if anything comes out of the Asia-Pacific Partnership, it’s worth re-examining the premise on which it is based, namely that with current technology it would be prohibitively costly to achieve the kinds of reductions in emissions needed to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and therefore, ultimately, global climate. The economy, it is assumed, cannot function without ample supplies of cheap energy. It is not surprising to see the Chinese government (still nominally communist) taking this line. The representation of technology in terms of recipes with fixed proportions of each input being essential is a central feature of old-fashioned Marxist economics, as is disregard for and distrust of price mechanisms. Lenin’s dictum that ‘Communism is Soviet power plus electrification’ is still influential, even if, in practice, capitalism is the goal nowadays. But for anyone who takes mainstream economics seriously, the idea that a physical resource like oil or coal is essential to prosperity must be regarded as fallacious. Economic theory teaches, and economic history has repeatedly shown, that when one resource becomes scarce, others are substituted to take its place. Some of these effects are immediate, but others take place over much longer periods of time. For example, an increase in petrol prices may cause some drivers to take fewer trips or switch to public transport. But the full effects will be felt only over a span of decades. Assuming higher prices are sustained, car buyers will switch to more fuel-efficient models (which manufacturers will have an incentive to develop), and home buyers will seek locations closer to work. The car fleet turns over in about 20 years, and the housing stock takes even longer. Economists measure such responses in terms of the price elasticity of demand. Econometric studies of energy demand tend to show a low elasticity, which explains some of the pessimism discussed above. But the ‘long run’ in such studies is typically only five years. The important responses to changes in energy prices are slower than this, suggesting that if the long run is measured over decades, energy demand will prove to be elastic. A standard calculation suggests that if carbon-based fuels account for about 8 per cent of <b>GDP</b> <b>at</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices,</b> and the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 in the very long term, a doubling of the effective price of carbon will eventually produce a reduction in emissions of 60 per cent, at a welfare cost of around 3 per cent of GDP or one year’s economic growth. We don’t need to rely on theoretical exercises like this, however, to demonstrate the capacity of the economy to handle price shocks. The world price of oil has tripled over the past few years, and the economic impact has been marginal. Admittedly, this increase arose from demand pressures rather than from a gradual policy-imposed increase in prices, but the example is still relevant. When the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development finally meets, its members will no doubt have much to say about technological solutions to climate change. They should not, however, ignore the power of market-based instruments. • Professor John Quiggin is a federation fellow in economics and political science based at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University.
