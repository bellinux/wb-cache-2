It fades the next day, but in cold, rainy weather it may last two, rarely three days.|$|R

50|$|The Feyzin {{disaster}} was {{the worst}} accident which had occurred in petroleum and petrochemical plants in Western Europe, prior to the Flixborough disaster in 1974. Since then, many pressurised tanks containing liquefied gases have BLEVE'd. The hazards are now better understood and storage spheres are protected from fire engulfment by better design. However, so many firemen and emergency servicemen have been killed while trying to control large fires that the cautious philosophy is to evacuate and take shelter until the material burns itself out. BLEVE's produce intense thermal radiation from the fireball. This and blast damage from the bursting pressure vessel are relatively localised compared with unconfined vapour cloud explosions. Therefore, evacuation of up to 0.5 km will usually {{ensure the safety of}} people. Burning hydrocarbon storage vessels <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>spectacular</b> but unpredictable. Therefore, newsmen and sightseers must be kept well away for their own safety.|$|R

50|$|Of the 14 {{specimens}} {{that exist}} nowadays, {{all but two}} {{are known to have}} taken between 1827 and 1834, many by the surgeon and naturalist Chevalier Joseph Alphonse Bernier. The Paris type specimen was {{in the collection of the}} Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle before that date, and one specimen may have been taken as late as 1850. As this species - the second-largest coua extant in modern times - <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>spectacular,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> much sought after as a museum piece. However, <b>it</b> probably <b>was</b> restricted to coastal rainforest on Nosy Boraha, and its habitat was largely destroyed by deforestation in the course of the 19th century. Introduction of black rats may also have contributed to its demise, probably less by direct predation than by competition for food, but there probably was a thriving rat population on Nosy Boraha as soon as 1700, considering that the island was a favorite place for pirates to overhaul. Cats, which would have preyed on the bird, were probably introduced only in the 19th century and make a more likely candidate for an introduced species that had a negative impact on Delalande's coua.|$|R

40|$|Mechanism {{of forming}} new {{capillary}} from basal vessels, named angiogenesis, exist under both physiological and pathological conditions. Initiation {{of this process}} requires imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, which can occur for instance under hypoxic conditions. Angiogenesis is complex process which allow tumor cells to proliferate, thus providing tumor to increase its structure. This dependence is highly connected to enhanced migration of tumor cells through blood, which often ends up being an onset of metastasis. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> proved that capillaries that form during tumor lifetime are different in case of morphology. However, it seems that antigens spread through these blood vessel {{are the same as}} antigens produced during physiological angiogenesis. In recent years angiogenesis {{has become one of the}} most important targets in therapies used in oncology. Antiangiogenic therapies have proven itself to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>spectacular</b> and promising in treatment of renal and pancreatic cancers or multiple myeloma. Bewacizumab, Sunitinib, Cetuximab and Talidomid are examples of drugs used in such therapies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are group that represents most of the drugs of antiangiogenic properties. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> worth mentioning that during administration of such substances spectrum of side effects is observed. However, antiangiogenic therapy is one of the most promising targets in today’s oncology. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> highly explainable to continue further research in this area...|$|R

On June 9 then came across a dome of quartz {{sticking}} out of the ground and decided to trench around it.

40|$|PHOENIX {{has been}} used to {{calculate}} model atmospheres of classical novae in the X-ray spectral range. The models account for an expanding, one-dimensional spherically symmetric medium in full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. Nova atmospheres have been modeled with PHOENIX since the early 90 's to fit the early nova spectra in the ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges. In this work the PHOENIX-code has been enhanced to also model X-ray spectra. This was accomplished by accounting for atomic data and physical processes. The synthetic spectra were compared to observations from the LETGS onboard the CHANDRA X-ray satellite. The template is the observation of nova V 4743 Sagittarii in March 2003. The spectrum <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>spectacular</b> because of the nova brightness and CHANDRA's spectral resolution. Further observations from July 2003, September 2003, and February 2004 were taken. Models with solar and non-solar abundances have been calculated and the synthetic spectra have been fitted to the four observations. The fits were used to discuss discrepancies between models and observations. The effective temperature of the atmosphere, the hydrogen column density, and the abundances ofhelium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron in the shell were determined by the fits. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> examined how the parameters evolve with time. With the models the atmosphere structure and NLTE effects were determined. The models were compared to the previous nova model atmospheres from PHOENIX [...] ...|$|R
