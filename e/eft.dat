25|$|In 1994, the Committee on Technology Issues {{relating}} to Payment systems, Cheque Clearing and Securities Settlement in the Banking Industry (1994) {{was set up}} under Chairman W S Saraf. It emphasised Electronic Funds Transfer (<b>EFT)</b> system, with the BANKNET communications network as its carrier. It also said that MICR clearing should be set up in all branches of all those banks with more than 100 branches.|$|E

In 1917, the company produced a total tonnage of 72,800 tons; the following year it raised production more than threefold, to 232,400 tons. In all, Skinner & Eddy delivered 32 ships to the <b>EFT,</b> including 29 freighters and three tankers, {{over the course of}} the war—more than that of any other shipyard in the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{first seven}} ships built by Skinner & Eddy were for private contractors. The company {{completed}} its first ship, Niels Nielson, on November 9, 1916, and had completed a further two {{by the time}} the United States entered the war in April 1917. These three ships along with four partially completed vessels were then requisitioned for war service by the newly created United States Shipping Board (USSB). Thereafter, Skinner & Eddy was to build ships exclusively for the USSB, through the latter's agency, the Emergency Fleet Corporation (<b>EFT).</b>|$|E

500|$|After the two magicians {{make their}} exit, {{confident}} in the lack of evidence against them, Mulder reveals to Scully the true trick being performed—that everything involving Alvarez was purely misdirection. Earlier, when checking whether Pinchbeck had stolen funds from the bank, the manager had told Mulder they would need his badge number and thumb print {{to gain access to}} the Electronic Fund Transfer (<b>EFT)</b> system. Mulder shows Scully Maleeni's wallet, which he had collected from evidence before confronting him and LaBonge. When the agents first met LaBonge, he had surreptitiously pickpocketed their badges as an example of his skill with sleight of hand, which gave him Mulder's badge number. Upon their first meeting with Pinchbeck impersonating his brother, Pinchbeck did a card trick with Mulder, leaving Mulder's prints on the card, which as Mulder displays, is securely in Maleeni's wallet. Mulder explains that the pair purposely acted in a high-profile manner to draw the attention of the FBI, and that if they had collected the badge number and thumbprint, they would have been able to perform EFTs. As Mulder and Scully leave the jail, Scully shows that she, too, has learned a trick, and turns her hand around 360 degrees in a similar fashion to what LaBonge did with his hand. Mulder asks Scully to explain how, and she brushes him off, saying simply [...] "magic".|$|E

2500|$|Early models {{assessing}} {{the possibility of}} slight deviations from Lorentz invariance have been published between the 1960s and the 1990s. In addition, a series of test theories of special relativity and effective field theories (<b>EFT)</b> for the evaluation and assessment of many experiments have been developed, including: ...|$|E

Some of these, such as automated applications {{designed to}} claim publicly available contracts accidentally put up without an associated cost, {{can result in}} a ban if discovered, while others are endorsed, tacitly or explicitly, by CCP. EVEMon, a [...]NET application that monitors and forecasts skill training times, is one example of an explicitly authorized external application. Another such application, Eve Fitting Tool or <b>EFT,</b> allows players to try different ship setups and see how certain skills and modules will affect that ship.|$|E
2500|$|Lorentz violating {{dispersion}} relations due to {{the presence}} of an anisotropic space might also lead to vacuum birefringence and parity violations. For instance, the polarization plane of photons might rotate due to velocity differences between left- and right-handed photons. In particular, gamma ray bursts, galactic radiation, and the cosmic microwave background radiation are examined. The SME coefficients [...] and [...] for Lorentz violation are given, 3 and 5 denote the mass dimensions employed.

2500|$|Lorentz {{violations}} {{could lead}} to differences between {{the speed of light}} and the limiting or maximal attainable speed (MAS) of any particle, whereas in special relativity the speeds should be the same. One possibility is to investigate otherwise forbidden effects at threshold energy in connection with particles having a charge structure (protons, electrons, neutrinos). This is because the dispersion relation is assumed to be modified in Lorentz violating <b>EFT</b> models such as SME. Depending on which of these particles travels faster or slower than the speed of light, effects such as the following can occur: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lorentz {{violations}} {{concern the}} fundamental predictions of special relativity, {{such as the}} principle of relativity, the constancy {{of the speed of}} light in all inertial frames of reference, and time dilation, as well as the predictions of the standard model of particle physics. [...] To assess and predict possible violations, test theories of special relativity and effective field theories (<b>EFT)</b> such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME) have been invented. These models introduce Lorentz and CPT violations through spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by hypothetical background fields, resulting in some sort of preferred frame effects. This could lead, for instance, to modifications of the dispersion relation, causing differences between the maximal attainable speed of matter and the speed of light.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{the only}} US Navy ships {{that can produce}} enough {{electrical}} power to get desired performance are the Zumwalt-class destroyers; they can generate 78 megawatts of power, more than is necessary to power a railgun. [...] Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. Most current destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range [...] (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles {{at a rate of}} 10 shots per minute). Even if current ships, such as the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, can be upgraded with enough electrical power to operate a railgun, the space taken up on the ships by the integration of an additional weapon system may force the removal of existing weapon systems to make room available. The first shipboard tests was to be from a railgun installed on an Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport (<b>EFT),</b> but this was later changed to land based testing.|$|E
