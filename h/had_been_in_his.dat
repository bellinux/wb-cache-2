5|$|Born in Denver, Colorado, {{and raised}} in Shelburne, New Hampshire, Bevin earned a bachelor's degree at Washington and Lee University in 1989, then served four years of active duty in the U.S. Army, {{attaining}} the rank of captain. He became wealthy in the investment business and moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1999. In 2011, he assumed the presidency of Bevin Brothers Manufacturing Company, the last remaining American manufacturer of bells. When Bevin took over, the business, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> family {{since its founding in}} 1832, was struggling and on the verge of closure. Bevin revived the company and restored its profitability.|$|E
5|$|Creating the {{new design}} was the {{responsibility}} of Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> position since 1925. Much {{of the work in}} preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E
5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a cobbler, and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods. He was their fourth child, {{following}} brothers Tony and Paul, and sister Karen Lane. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street, in the Kensington district of Liverpool. For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that the house <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E

40|$|In this {{recording}} Dell talks with evangelist Paul Reed of Decatur, GA. Dell talks about Elijah and praises Reed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> efforts {{to join the}} ministry. Reed talks about influential ministers that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, and how he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> successful <b>in</b> <b>his</b> healing ministry. They talk about Elijah being called to God {{and how he was}} an example of fearfulness as well as strength...|$|R

5|$|Robert Dudley {{had been}} close to the Knollys family since the early 1550s; several of Lettice's {{brothers}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> service and his marriage only enhanced his relations with her siblings. To his four stepchildren he was a concerned and generous stepfather. The Dudleys' domestic life is partly documented in the Earl's accounts; Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex, remaining largely excluded from society life.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> battalion.|$|E
5|$|From Bononia {{they crossed}} the Channel to Britain and {{made their way to}} Eboracum (York), capital of the {{province}} of Britannia Secunda and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the Picts beyond Hadrian's Wall in the summer and autumn. Constantius's campaign, like that of Septimius Severus before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success. Constantius had become severely sick {{over the course of his}} reign, and died on 25 July 306 in Eboracum (York). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The Alamannic king Chrocus, a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule; Hispania, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.|$|E

5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E
5|$|Wizard {{then went}} to Epsom Downs for the Derby Stakes, where he was again ridden by Clift, as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{previous}} two races. He started as the odds-on favourite, priced at about 8/11. Fair Star was the second favourite, with Salivator third in the betting. Salivator took the lead and held it until the field turned into the finishing straight, where Wizard overtook him. Wizard was in front until {{a few yards from}} the finish, where he was passed by Pope, a 20/1 outsider. Pope won the race by a neck from Wizard with Salivator in third and Fair Star in fourth. In his last race of the season Wizard finished fourth in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. The race was won by Ashton, who had started as favourite. The St. Leger was the first time Wizard had not been ridden by William Clift, with Francis Buckle riding him.|$|E
25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time {{one of the most}} celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} of Ph√°t's {{personal}} life except that he was married and, according to The New York Times, believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late 30s {{when he made his}} coup attempts, implying he <b>was</b> born <b>in</b> the mid-to-late 1920s. He died in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Horatio went on {{to become}} a Lieutenant Colonel in the 3rd Middlesex Artillery (V). His career was both of a {{political}} and business nature.

50|$|He led {{a retired}} life in Vienna.

25|$|When Dance {{was about}} 3 years old, his father died. Dance {{had always thought}} that his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early fifties when he died, but {{discovered}} that was incorrect when he {{took part in the}} Who Do You Think You Are? TV programme first broadcast on 6 July 2017, in which he discovered his father was actually some 25 years older when he died.|$|E
25|$|The {{content of}} McReynolds's {{proposal}} {{and the bill}} later submitted by Roosevelt were so similar to each other that it is thought the most probable source of the idea. Roosevelt and Cummings also relished the opportunity to hoist McReynolds by his own petard. McReynolds, having been born in 1862, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early fifties when he wrote his 1914 proposal, but was well over seventy when Roosevelt's plan was set forth.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013 Snowden took a {{leave of}} absence, telling his {{supervisors}} he was returning to the mainland for epilepsy treatment, but instead left Hawaii for Hong Kong where he arrived on May 20. Snowden told Guardian reporters in June that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> room at the Mira Hotel since his arrival in the city, rarely going out. On June 10, correspondent Ewen MacAskill said Snowden had left his hotel only briefly three times since May 20.|$|E

25|$|This did not, though, {{stop the}} {{continued}} blaming of Munch {{for the situation}} Denmark <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in.</b> <b>His</b> policies were largely disowned by the political elite (his own Radical party the only exception). 'Never again a 9 April' ('Aldrig mere en 9. April') became a mantra for Danish politicians, and gradually a new bipartisan consensus emerged between the Liberals, Conservatives and Social Democrats regarding Danish foreign and security policy, which would lead to membership of NATO in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of his Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, in November 1941, King was well aware of the need for the {{government}} to have a strong, well-respected member of cabinet to serve as a new deputy for Quebec to help deal with the volatile conscription issue. King <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> political infancy when he witnessed the Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I and he wanted to prevent the same divisions from threatening his government.|$|E
25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E

25|$|Matzeliger {{was born}} on a coffee {{plantation}} in Dutch Guiana, now Suriname. His father, Ernst Matzeliger, was a third generation Dutchman of German descent living in the Dutch Guiana capital city of Paramaribo. He owned and operated the Colonial Shipworks that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> family for three generations. His mother was a house slave of African descent; she lived on the plantation of which his father was the owner for a time. At the age of ten, Jan Matzeliger was apprenticed in the Colonial Ship Works in Paramaribo, where he demonstrated a natural aptitude for machinery and mechanics. He left Dutch Guiana at age 19, {{and worked as a}} mechanic on a Dutch East Indies merchant ship for several years before settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he first learned the shoe trade. By 1877, he spoke adequate English (Dutch was his native tongue) and moved to Massachusetts to pursue his interest in the shoe industry.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
