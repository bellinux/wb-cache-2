In analyzing {{the determinants of}} soil conservation investments there, this study goes beyond the conventional physical factors to examine institutional, social capital and public program effects. The double hurdle statistical analysis from 250 farms in the Tigray region reveals different causal factors for soil conservation adoption versus intensity of use. The determinants of adoption of soil conservation measures vary sharply between stone terraces and soil bunds. Physical propensity toward erosion (e. g., slope, slope shape and soil texture) and land suitability for conservation helped determine conservation investments in all cases. But institutional and social determinants of investment differed importantly between bunds and terraces. Long-term investments in stone terraces were associated with secure land tenure, labor availability, proximity to the farmstead, and learning opportunities via the availability of <b>food-for-work</b> <b>projects.</b> By contrast, short-term investments in soil bunds were strongly linked to insecure land tenure {{and the absence of}} <b>food-for-work</b> <b>projects.</b> Farm beneficiaries of public soil conservation programs were less likely to invest privately in either type of conservation practice. Social capital, as measured by farmer perception of community pressure to curb soil erosion, did not contribute significantly to either kind of conservation investment. The intensity of stone terrace adoption (measured as meters of terrace per hectare) was determined by expected returns but not by capacity to invest. Higher intensity of stone terrace construction was favored by fertile-but-erodible silty soils in (rainy) highland settings that offered valuable yield benefits from soil conservation. Intensity of terracing was also greater in remote villages where limited off-farm employment opportunities made construction costs relatively low. Previous research has highlighted the need for public policy interventions to supplement private incentives to make soil conservation investments in erosion-prone mountain areas. Our results highlight the importance of the right kind of public interventions. Direct public involvement in constructing soil conservation structures on private lands appears to undermine incentives for private conservation investments. When done on public lands, however, public conservation activities may encourage private soil conservation by example. Secure land tenure rights clearly reinforce private incentives to make long-term investments in soil conservation. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} factors that {{determine}} the household supply of labour in <b>food-for-work</b> (FFW) <b>projects</b> that seek to address food insecurity and help capital formation in development. Based on data from a survey conducted in 2003 in Tigray, Ethiopia, our probit analysis identifies factors that significantly affect the household decision to participate in FFW programmes. We correct for selection bias, and estimate total and excess supply of FFW labour. Our finding of substantial leakages in targeting that allow relatively well-off households to obtain FFW employment yield important implications for the prevailing FFW wage. We also argue that FFW programmes will be more effective if {{they are designed to}} account for geographic heterogeneity in such factors as male to female labour participation differences and the incidence of debilitating diseases. ...|$|R
40|$|Evaluations of the {{numerous}} <b>Food-for-Work</b> (FFW) <b>projects</b> in operation across Ethiopia are designed to assess their effectiveness, and are often defined by the objectives stated {{in the terms of}} reference. The paper asserts that the quality and usefulness of evaluations is greatly enhanced when the qualitative impacts of a project on the beneficiaries are included in the assessment since they often have a direct influence on conventional donor concerns such as targeting and the mode of payment. An evaluation framework is proposed which covers the design and delivery, outputs and impacts of a project and this structure is then adopted for a review of FFW evaluation documents. The analysis reveals the heavy emphasis on design and delivery mechanisms in the literature, and suggests the scope of evaluation exercises might be broadened to capture both the intended and unforeseen socio-economic impacts of a project.

40|$|<b>Food-for-work</b> (FFW) <b>projects</b> {{face the}} {{challenge}} of addressing three kinds of objectives: to feed hungry people, to build public works where needed, and to be feasible for prompt project implementation. In the debate over how to target FFW to the poorest of the poor, the last two program objectives are often overlooked. This research examines FFW afforestation and erosion-control programs in central Tigray, Ethiopia, during 1992 - 95 in order to examine how these sometimes conflicting objectives were reconciled. The study decomposes the factors determining a household's FFW participation into three decision stages. First, at the regional level, project planners choose where to locate a FFW resource conservation project. Second, at the village level, a committee decides which villagers will be eligible to participate. Finally, the eligible households may decide whether and how much to participate. Using probit and truncated regression methods, the study finds that project implementation feasibility most influenced the probability that FFW projects would be available in the 25 villages surveyed. Among the 129 households in villages with FFW available, FFW eligibility was inversely related to household land area per capita and household size, results which are consistent with anti-poverty targeting. However, the model performed poorly at predicting non-eligibility for FFW, which suggests that anti-poverty targeting was not efficient. Among households eligible for FFW, those with greater resources (larger families that did not lease out land) tended to participate and supply more days of FFW labor than poorer households. The only households eligible for FFW which did not participate were unable (rather than unwilling) to do so, being comprised mostly of elderly women. Overall, anti-poverty targeting was sub-optimal but reasonable, given the feasibility constraint that these resource conservation projects to be sited in where labor and materials could be made available.

This research examines FFW afforestation and erosion-control programs in central Tigray, Ethiopia, during 1992 - 95 in order to understand how these sometimes conflicting objectives were reconciled. Statistical analyses examined the factors that influenced (1) in which villages FFW projects were located, (2) which households were deemed eligible to participate in FFW (in those villages having FFW projects), and (3) which eligible households elected to participate, and (4) how much time the participating households dedicated to FFW activities. Project feasibility outweighed the needs for food security or natural resource conservation in influencing whether an FFW project would be located in one of the 25 villages surveyed. In villages where FFW was available, anti-poverty targeting appears to be taking place, since smaller households with less land {{were more likely to be}} eligible to participate in FFW projects. But although the poor were likely to be eligible for FFW, some non-poor households were also eligible, which suggests that anti-poverty targeting was not efficient, Among households eligible for FFW, those that were relatively better off (larger families that did not lease outland) tended to participate and supply more days of FFW labor than the poorest households. The only households eligible for FFW which did not participate were headed mostly by elderly women and hence unable (rather than unwilling) to participate. Overall, anti-poverty targeting was sub-optimal but reasonable, considering that these resource conservation projects need to be located where labor and materials could be made available...|$|R
