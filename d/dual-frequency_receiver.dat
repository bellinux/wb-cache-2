40|$|Institute (GSI), Japan, have {{commenced}} a {{joint project}} to develop, deploy and test an innovative hardware/software system design for an automatic, continuously-operated ground deformation monitoring {{system based on}} low-cost GPS receiver technology. Conventional continuously-operated GPS (CGPS) networks, {{such as the one}} established in Japan by GSI to precisely measure earth surface movement, are very expensive. The high cost being primarily {{due to the fact that}} <b>dual-frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> are used. Japan’s nationwide GEONET network is the world’s largest, numbering nearly 1000 receiver stations, with an average station spacing of the order of 30 km. In order to densify such CGPS networks (important when high spatial resolution for the monitoring of the deformation phenomenon is required), and to promote the use of the CGPS technique in lesser developed countries, a significantly cheaper system architecture is needed. The proposed design is an integrated, dual-mode network consisting of low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers across the area of interest, surrounded by a sparser network of <b>dual-frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers.</b> Initial tests of data collected at selected stations in the GEONET network have already shown that through enhanced data processing algorithms a CGPS network containing both single-frequency and <b>dual-frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> would be able to deliver better than centimetre level accuracies, at considerably lower cost than present systems based exclusively on dual-frequency instrumentation.

40|$|A {{harvester}} enables detailed roundwood data to {{be collected}} during harvesting operations {{by means of the}} measurement apparatus integrated into its felling head. These data can be used to improve the efficiency of wood procurement and also replace some of the field measurements, and thus provide both less costly and more detailed ground truth for remote sensing based forest inventories. However, the positional accuracy of harvester-collected tree data is not sufficient currently to match the accuracy per individual trees achieved with remote sensing data. The aim {{in the present study was}} to test the accuracy of various instruments utilizing global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) in motion under forest canopies of varying densities to enable us to get an understanding of the current state-of-the-art in GNSS-based positioning under forest canopies. Tests were conducted using several different combinations of GNSS and inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted on an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) “simulating” a moving harvester. The positions of 224 trees along the driving route were measured using a total-station and real-time kinematic GPS. These trees were used as reference items. The position of the ATV was obtained using GNSS and IMU with an accuracy of 0. 7 m (root mean squared error (RMSE) for 2 D positions). For the single-frequency GNSS receivers, the RMSE of real-time 2 D GNSS positions was 4. 2 – 9. 3 m.

40|$|Permanent GPS {{networks}} {{have been established}} since the 1980 s to support a variety of geodetic applications, ranging from local deformation monitoring to large scale crustal motion measurement. Continuously operating GPS (CGPS) networks, consisting of geodetic-grade, <b>dual-frequency</b> <b>receiver</b> systems, generally support relative positioning to sub-centimetre accuracy, even for baselines up to several thousand kilometres in length. However, due to their comparatively high cost, the density of such GPS stations is rarely high enough to support all geodetic applications. For example, although the Geographical Survey Institute has established nearly 1000 permanent GPS stations across Japan, the average inter-station spacing is {{of the order of}} 30 km. This paper describes a method by which a sub-network of comparatively low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers can be deployed to increase the density of typical CGPS networks. In this way it is possible to increase the spatial resolution of the measured ground deformation, while still maintaining the same level of precision as a CGPS network comprised entirely of dual-frequency GPS receivers. In order to reduce the system biases associated with single-frequency data processing, an innovative medium-range, GPS positioning technique that combines the processing of single-frequency and dual-frequency data is proposed.

Conventional continuously-operated GPS (CGPS) networks, {{such as the one}} established in Japan by GSI to precisely measure earth surface movement, are very expensive.

Japan’s nationwide GEONET network is the world’s largest, numbering nearly 1000 receiver stations, with an average station spacing of the order of 30 km. In order to densify such CGPS networks (important when high spatial resolution for the monitoring of the deformation phenomenon is required), and to promote the use of the CGPS technique in lesser developed countries, a significantly cheaper system architecture is needed. The proposed design is an integrated, dual-mode network consisting of low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers across the area of interest, surrounded by a sparser network of <b>dual-frequency</b> GPS <b>receivers.</b> Initial tests of data collected at selected stations in the GEONET network have already shown that through enhanced data processing algorithms a CGPS network containing both single-frequency and <b>dual-frequency</b> <b>receivers</b> would be able to deliver better than centimetre level accuracies, at considerably lower cost than present systems based exclusively on dual-frequency instrumentation. This paper reports the results of the first field test of this new CGPS system design, in the Tsukuba area of Japan, in August 1999. The test network consisted of: (a) several stations of the GEONET network surrounding (b) an inner network of four single-frequency Canadian Marconi GPS receivers installed by UNSW researchers. The data from both the GEONET and the UNSW receivers were processed using a specially modified version of the Bernese GPS Software Package. The software first processes the GEONET GPS station data in order to generate empirical corrections which are then applied to the double-differenced data of the GPS baselines located within the test area enclosed by the dual-frequency CGPS stations. These corrections have the effect of improving baseline solution accuracy by up to an order of magnitude, even for baselines ranging up to 100 km in length. The baselines connecting the inner network to the surrounding GEONET stations are processed in a number of modes, including 24 hr files (as is the standard practice for geodynamic applications) and hourly data files (as in volcano deformation monitoring applications). The results indicate that single-frequency-with-correction processing can achieve accuracies of better than 5 mm in the horizontal components and 3 cm in height, while the dual-frequency results can achieve accuracies better than 2 mm in the horizontal components and 6 mm in height. In the authors’ opinion, for certain geodynamic applications there are no significant differences between the single-frequency-with-correction results and the dual-frequency results, especially for the horizontal components.|$|R
50|$|Use of 40 kHz {{would permit}} use of <b>dual-frequency</b> time code <b>receivers</b> already {{produced}} for the Japanese JJY transmitters. With the decommissioning of the Swiss longwave time station HBG at 75 kHz, that frequency is potentially also available.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) {{provides}} precise geographical {{data for}} making global precise map. ALOS has a <b>dual-frequency</b> GPS <b>receiver</b> to determine geographic positions corresponding to points on satellite images. In order {{to confirm the}} orbit determination accuracy by GPS, we carried out a restricted laser ranging campaign {{with the support of}} the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS). We found the GPS orbit agreed with the SLR orbit to within the resolution range of the SLR analysis...|$|R
