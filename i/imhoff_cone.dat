40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to examine the cause of lag-phase growth during phenol degradation by mixed microbial cultures that had been acclimated to one of four substrates. Four aerated <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cones</b> were inoculated with wastewater sludge and fed one of four substrates: acetate, egg albumin, vegetable oil, or phenol. Inocula from these cones were injected into batch reactors containing phenol. Time-dependent growth was measured by two methods: most probable number (MPN) and epifluorescence microscopy (EM). The MPN technique was used to distinguish two cell concentrations: total cells and a phenol-degrading community within the total; EM was also used to count total cells. The results indicated that a lag in phenol utilization for all cultures, except the phenol-acclimated cultures, {{was a result of}} growth of a phenol-degrading subpopulation, and not due to enzyme induction of the existing population.

50|$|Removal of {{suspended}} particles by sedimentation {{depends upon the}} size and specific gravity of those particles. Suspended solids retained on a filter may remain in suspension if their specific gravity is similar to water while very dense particles passing through the filter may settle.

50|$|Solid {{material}} in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled.

Settleable solids are measured as the visible volume accumulated {{at the bottom of}} an <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cone</b> after water has settled for one hour.

30|$|Physicochemical {{parameters}} of water were recorded daily at 10  h. Temperature (T,  °C), dissolved oxygen (DO, mg/L), total dissolved salts (TDS, mg/L), ionized ammonia (NH 4 –N, mg/L), non-ionized ammonia (NH 3 –N, mg/L) and nitrate (NO 3 –N, mg/L) were {{measured with a}} multi-sensor (Professional Plus model, YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA), and pH was measured using EcoTestr™ pH 2 (Pérez-Fuentes et al. 2018). The concentration of nitrite (NO 2 –N, mg/L), general hardness (GH, mg/L) and carbonate hardness (KH, mg/L) were determined by colorimetry (Hagen Nutrafin, Mansfield MA) and settleable solids (SS, ml/L) with 1000  mL <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cones</b> after 20  min of sedimentation (Pérez-Fuentes et al. 2018).

Phosphorus and solids recovery was calculated. Results indicated that Al 2 (SO 4) 3 and FeCl 3 were the most effective flocculants. Little improvement was observed when the flocculant was added at a concentration of 625 mg/l compared with 250 mg/L. Both flocculants recovered more than 85 % of solids and more than ß 70 % of the phosphorus. Addition of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 at a concentration of 625 mg/l increased phosphorus removal to 90 %. Diet and feeding period were significant influences on results. As the pigs aged, manure phosphorus was more soluble, possibly explaining the observation that less phosphorus was settled in feeding period 3 compared with periods 1 and 2.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{realistic}} values of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), an ultrasonic flow meter and an automatic water sampler were installed at the basin outlet for three Reno tributaries (Bologna Apennine, Italy). The basins have a similar geological setting: in the Sillaro basin, however, clays represent the dominant feature; in the Lavino basin, sandstone and clay marl are widely present; and {{the main part of}} the Savena watershed is characterised by sandrock, pebbly sandstone and clay marls. These differences are recognisable in the particle size distribution of the suspended sediment samples collected in these basins. The aim of this work is to estimate the SSCs of river water samples with two indirect methods, turbidity measurement and free settleable solids in <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cones,</b> and the relations with suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Alongside these investigations, laboratory analyses were performed in order to validate these methods under controlled conditions. The turbidity measurements were highly significant, but their reliability was influenced by the concentration and the particle size distribution. In order to estimate the SSCs, it was necessary to establish specific regression curves for each stream. The estimate of the SSC obtained through a free settleable solids analysis was not only reliable but also less sensitive to sample characteristics. The measure of the settleable solids after 1 and 24 h presented a constant relationship in all the samples from the three streams, due to the compaction of the sediment. The measure of the settleable solids after 24 h gave a better estimate of the SSC. This last method was shown to be inexpensive, fast, reliable and applicable to all the situations studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{key element}} in a stream-monitoring {{programme}} for sediment transport is {{the choice of the}} measuring technique for suspended sediment concentration: this can highly affect both project costs and data reliability. The gravimetric method represents the standard analysis to directly measure suspended sediment concentration in a water sample. Indirect techniques are often employed for their inexpensiveness, although they need to be calibrated on gravimetric analysis results. In this study, the reliability of settleable solids in Imhoff cones was addressed as an alternative indirect method to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC), verifying the results with the turbidity measures of a laboratory nephelometer. The results show a high correlation of settled solids with suspended sediment concentration. Also, the results from the turbidimetric analysis showed a good correlation with SSC, but limited to water samples that did not need dilution. Measurements were repeated after storing the samples for 1 month: results exhibit an increase in turbidity and settleable solids, probably due to algae growth and anaerobic processes with the production of gases, causing an increase in matter. From our study, the <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cone</b> was shown to be a useful instrument to estimate suspended sediment concentration for the simplicity, the reliability and the low cost of their results. Our results prove how Imhoff cones are preferable to turbidimetric analysis to estimate SSC, specifically for highly turbid samples...|$|E
40|$|Although {{high rate}} algae ponds (HRAPs) are a proven {{wastewater}} treatment technology with numerous environmental, social, and economic benefits, their widespread use has been hindered by inconsistent and unreliable settling performance. Hence, {{the goal of}} this thesis is to investigate how specific operational parameters affect the settling performance of HRAPs. Nine HRAPs (30 m 2 surface area, 0. 3 m depth) were operated as three triplicate sets, with each set run on either a 2, 3, or 4 day HRT continuously from January 25, 2012 through April 11, 2013. Settling performance was determined (i) by measuring the TSS of <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cone</b> supernatant after 2 and 24 hours of settling and (ii) by measuring the TSS of tube settler effluent. Ponds operating on 2 - 3 day HRTs (loading rate was 24 - 36 g/m 3 -day csBOD 5 and food to microorganism (F/M) ratio was 0. 13 - 0. 21 day- 1) were able to settle consistently with residual TSS averaging less than 40 mg/L after 2 hours of settling time. Tube settlers showed potential as effective harvesting devices; ponds operating on a 2 -day HRT averaged 27. 9 ± 9. 2 mg/L TSS in tube settler effluent at an overflow rate (OFR) of 9. 4 L/min-m 2.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{possible}} utilisation of wood ash as a reagent in treating acid mine drainage (AMD) from opencast mining of brown coal. Wood ash samples were obtained having combusted deciduous and coniferous tree wood in a household furnace. The dominant mineral phases in wood ash are calcite, quartz, lime and periclase. The used AMD is characteristic of high contents of sulphates, iron, manganese, heavy metals and low pH. The AMD treatment process included dosing of wood ash to adjust pH values about 8. 3 (a dose of 0. 5 g l− 1) or calcium hydroxide (a dose of 0. 2 g l− 1) for comparison. The reaction time was 20 min. Dosing of wood ash in AMD resulted in an increase of pH in solution from 3. 5 to 8. 3, which caused the removal of metal ions mainly by precipitation, co-precipitation and adsorption. Comparing the application of Ca(OH) 2 in AMD treatment, at an almost identical pH value the concentrations fell in both cases for Fe, Mn, As, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mg, Al and Mo. Applying wood ash the drop was even more distinct in Mn, Zn and Mg. The results of sedimentation tests in an <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cone</b> confirm that the settling capacities of sludge using wood ash are significantly better than when using calcium hydroxide in acid mine drainage treatment.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the biofiltration {{ability of the}} aquatic fern Azolla to remove polyphenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from olive mill wastewater (OMWw) collected from the traditional (TS) and continuous (CS) extraction systems. Azolla biomass was packed into five sequential <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cones</b> and five sequential columns. In both experiments, the filtrates collected from the 5 th biofilter showed a decrease in polyphenol contents: from 7650 mg l – 1 to 3610 mg l – 1 in TS OMWw and from 3852 mg l – 1 to 1351 mg l – 1 in CS OMWw. The COD contents decreased from 110200 mg L – 1 to 52400 mg L – 1 in TS OMWw and from 41600 mg L – 1 to 2300 mg L – 1 in CS OMWw. A 5 : 1 OMWw to Azolla -fresh-weight ratio was optimal for both polyphenol and COD removal. The biofiltration ability of alfalfa was {{compared with that of}} Azolla, but the treatment with alfalfa did not result in the reduction of COD or polyphenols.

40|$|Microalgae can {{be grown}} on {{municipal}} wastewater media to both treat the wastewater and produce feedstock for algae biofuel production. However the reliability of treatment must be demonstrated, as well as high areal algae productivity on recycled wastewater media and efficient sedimentation harvesting. This processes was studied at pilot scale in the present research. A pilot facility was operated with nine CO 2 -supplemented raceway ponds, each with a 33 -m 2 surface area and a 0. 3 -m depth, continuously from March 6, 2013 through September 24, 2014. The ponds were operated as three sets of triplicates with two sets continuously fed primary-clarified municipal wastewater at either a 2 -day or 3 -day hydraulic residence time (HRT), and one set fed the clarified effluent of the 3 -day pond set. This second pond-in-series was operated with a 3 -day HRT. Areal biomass productivity is reported as gross and net, the former based only on biomass in the pond effluents and the latter subtracting the volatile suspended solids in the influent {{from those in the}} effluent. An estimate was also made of autotrophic biomass productivity, as differentiated from heterotrophic growth. Over a year, net productivity averaged 83 metric tons per hectare per year (MT/ha-yr) for the 2 -day HRT ponds, 52 MT/ha-yr for the 3 -day HRT ponds, and 44 MT/ha-yr for the 3 -day HRT ponds receiving clarified effluent of the first set of 3 -day HRT ponds (i. e., recycled water). The lower net productivity of the pond receiving water recycling was attributed to two factors. First, the relatively high influent suspended solids concentrations were subtracted from the effluent suspended solids concentrations before net productivity was calculated. Second, the recycled water contained less soluble organic matter than the primary-clarified wastewater leading to less heterotrophic biomass production. The accumulation of inhibitory allelochemicals is a possible third cause of lower productivity, but no specific information was collected on allelopathy. Algae were harvested from pond effluent by sedimentation, with harvest efficiency most affected by the extent of natural bioflocculation occurring in the ponds. Some forms of bioflocculation are thought to be mediated by bacteria, which often make-up a substantial fraction of the settled flocs. Pond samples settled in 1 -L <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cones</b> averaged/L total suspended solids after 24 hours of settling; but all ponds fell short of meeting an averaged/L total suspended solids after a 2 hour interval which would be ideally achieved for wastewater effluent. No relationship was seen between settling performance and the bacterial content of flocs. Soluble carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (scBOD 5) removal by the raceway ponds was sufficient to meet wastewater treatment requirements year around. Influent scBOD 5 concentrations averaged 83 mg/L, and the effluent averaged 5. 1 mg/L and 4. 2 mg/L for the 2 -day and 3 -day HRT pond sets, respectively. The variable with the greatest influence on productivity in all pond sets, and settling performance in the recycled water pond set, was season (i. e., co-correlated variables of solar insolation and pond temperature). Neither productivity nor settling appeared to be related to prominent algae genera or prevalence of grazers. The high net productivity achieved with a growth medium of primary clarifier effluent and the generally high settleability of algal-bacterial flocs indicate a good potential for algae wastewater treatment and biofuel production. However, the settling of algae grown on recycled water needs improvement to achieve the full potential of wastewater-grown algae biofuel production...|$|R

This paper reports {{an approach to}} estimate the sludge density in a physicochemical treatment of municipal wastewater, experiments considered 4 coagulants (aluminum sulfate SAl, iron sulfate SFe, aluminum polychloride PAX, iron poly-chloride PIX), and 2 flocculant products (cationic CP and anionic AP polymers). Experimental approach is based on running a set of jar tests at different coagulant concentrations. After the stirring and resting times took place, pH and conductivity were registered finding that SAl and SFe either with or without polymers are the coagulants producing the higher pH drop. Conductivity measures also establish two kind of data since higher conductivity (about 2000 μS·cm− 1) was observed for SAl, and PIX, PIX + CP, PIX + AP; otherwise a conductivity about 1300 μS·cm− 1 was observed for SAl + PC, SFe and PAX alone and with CP or AP. Settleable solids (SST) determined with an <b>Imhoff</b> <b>cone</b> were similar for sulfates and polychlorides, but dry sludge (DS) clearly set up two groups the one with higher sludge content corre-sponds to sulfates group.
