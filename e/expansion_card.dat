25|$|AirPort debuted on July 21, 1999, at Macworld New York, with Steve Jobs {{picking up}} an iBook {{supposedly}} {{to give the}} cameraman a better shot as he surfed the Web. The initial offering consisted of an optional <b>expansion</b> <b>card</b> for Apple's new line of iBook notebooks and an AirPort Base Station. The AirPort card (a repackaged Lucent ORiNOCO Gold Card PC Card adapter) was later added as an option for almost all of Apple's product line, including PowerBooks, eMacs, iMacs, and Power Macs. Only Xserves do not have it as a standard or optional feature. The original AirPort system allowed transfer rates up to 11 Mbit/s and was commonly used to share Internet access and files between multiple computers.|$|E
25|$|Attached devices {{can take}} either {{the form of}} an {{integrated}} circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an <b>expansion</b> <b>card</b> that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} SPARCstation 1 design {{included an}} expansion bus technology, SBus, expressly {{designed for the}} form factor; <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> were small, especially in comparison to other <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> in use at the time such as VMEbus, and were mounted horizontally instead of vertically. PC&#8209;compatible computers {{in this type of}} case typically use the PCI expansion bus and are usually either a) limited to one or two horizontally placed <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> or b) require special low-profile <b>expansion</b> <b>cards,</b> shorter than the PCI cards regular PCs use.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the form}} factor of the {{motherboard}} and case, around one to seven <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be added to}} a computer system. 19 or more <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> can be installed in backplane systems. When many <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> are added to a system, total power consumption and heat dissipation become limiting factors. Some <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> take up more than one slot space. For example, many graphics cards on the market as of 2010 are dual slot graphics cards, using the second slot as a place to put an active heat sink with a fan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>cards</b> (PCBs) {{could be}} {{inserted}} without {{removal of the}} exterior case, as was required for the IBM PC. Even modern (IBM clone) designs still require removal of the case to add <b>expansion</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although one of {{the first}} {{peripherals}} for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like <b>expansion</b> <b>card</b> that let it run 8-bit CP/M software, CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. Byte magazine, at the time {{one of the}} leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. InfoWorld described the unsuccessful efforts at introducing CP/M based home computers in 1983 and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.|$|E
25|$|A {{firmware}} rootkit uses device or platform firmware {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI <b>expansion</b> <b>card</b> ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|E
