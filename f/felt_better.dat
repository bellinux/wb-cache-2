Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed that he had never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in his life and his outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E
5|$|Reamon, who {{had helped}} guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael with his SATs and helped {{him and his family}} choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> {{guidance}} was available under Frank Beamer, who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E

Once receiving seal meat, the woman <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> within hours and said that her quick recovery was due to the consumption of seal meat and blood. Borré experienced this many times among many different members of the group and they all attributed their sickness to the lack of Inuit food.|$|E

It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a {{seasoned}} cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Donick Cary and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland, {{with a couple of}} scenes being directed by Matthew Nastuk. Kirkland, who was going through a divorce during the episode's production, assigned Nastuk, his assistant director, to take over direction in his stead. However, after Nastuk had directed a scene, Kirkland <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and returned to direct the rest of the episode. The episode features the revelation of Homer's middle name, [...] "Jay", which is a tribute to characters from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "I {{loved this}} episode for... its careful {{layering}} {{and expansion of}} the series’ key themes, and for the way it’s setting us up for a truly superb, universe-shaking episode when Fringe returns Dec. 2." [...] The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining he enjoyed the episode more than the previous visit to the parallel universe because [...] "the last five minutes or so of 'The Abducted' were more compelling than the case-of-the-week. But not far more. The Candy Man is just so creepy—and his crime so powerfully symbolic—that I <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> about this episode overall than I did about 'Amber." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Gore {{became a}} vegan. He had earlier {{admitted}} that [...] "it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets {{across the world}} {{is one of the}} issues connected to this global crisis – {{not only because of the}} [...] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process" [...] and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said [...] "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like. ... I <b>felt</b> <b>better,</b> so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} greeted with {{widespread}} derision in preview screenings. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it and thought it was a great piece of science fiction." [...] Christian also spoke of an initially positive reception, mentioning an enthusiastic response from both the audience and Tarantino.|$|E

500|$|Potemkin {{fell ill}} in the fever-ridden city of Jassy, though he kept busy, {{overseeing}} peace talks, planning his assault on Poland and preparing the army for renewed {{war in the}} south. He fasted briefly and recovered some strength, but refused medicine and began to feast once again, consuming a [...] "ham, a slated goose and three or four chickens". On , he <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and dictated a letter to Catherine before collapsing once more. Later, he awoke and dispatched his entourage to Nikolayev. On [...] Potemkin died in the open steppe, 40miles from Jassy. Picking up on contemporary rumor, historians such as the Polish Jerzy Łojek have suggested that he was poisoned because his madness made him a liability, but this is rejected by Montefiore, who suggests he succumbed to bronchial pneumonia instead.|$|E
500|$|At half-time, the {{trainers}} found on Schulz [...] "a mass {{of black and}} blue spots". [...] His [...] "face was distorted with bumps", and there were [...] "welts {{on his back and}} groin". [...] As the second half started, Schulz insisted he <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and went back into the game. [...] But the attack continued. [...] "Another scrimmage and two more Penn men were after him again. [...] He went into the play and for an instant, his strength came back, but it couldn't last, and it didn't.” [...] Yost finally sent in a substitute, and Schulz limped to the sideline and walked slowly away [...] "with head bowed and hands to his stomach". [...] And when the [...] "rubbers" [...] removed his togs and examined him, [...] "they marveled {{that he was able to}} walk". [...] In the end, Schulz [...] "didn't say a wordbig tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it".|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

500|$|Muramasa Rebirth, {{released}} in Japan under its original title of Oboro Muramasa, is a port of Muramasa developed by Vanillaware for the PlayStation Vita. According to its development team, the Vita {{was chosen as}} the port's platform over the more commercially successful Xbox 360 and PS3 due to the Vita's OLED-based screen, which they <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> portray the game's palette. While content was cut from the original version, the team decided against going back and restoring it, instead creating new additional content. The controls were also adjusted to suit the new platform. Muramasa Rebirth was published in Japan by Marvelous AQL on March 28, 2013.

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E

500|$|Levi Buchanan from IGN {{believed}} that the console [...] "was not built to handle Nights" [...] due to the game occasionally clipping and warping, though he admitted that the graphics were [...] "pretty darn good". A reviewer from Mean Machines Sega praised the game's vibrant colours and detailed textures, and described its animation as being [...] "fluid as water". The reviewer also noted occasional pop-in and glitching during the game. Sam Hickman from the British Sega Saturn Magazine praised the visuals and colour scheme as rich in both texture and detail, while suggesting that Nights into Dreams {{is one of the}} most captivating games on the Saturn. Next Generation similarly commended the game's visuals, stating that they were [...] "beyond a doubt" [...] the most fluid and satisfying for any game on any system. Upon release, the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine opined that the game would have a significant impact on the video game industry, particularly that in the action game genre. The reviewer also stated that the game <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> through the use of the analogue pad, in contrast to the conventional controller, and also praised the light and smooth feeling the analogue pad portrayed during gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Emile Rafael {{directed}} the official music video for [...] "Trouble", with cinematography by Charlie Herranz. During {{an interview with}} Elle, Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
