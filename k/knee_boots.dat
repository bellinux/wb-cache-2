60|$|As Bransome spoke, {{the subject}} of this encomium came up from the little gorge by the lake outlet, and it struck Helen Savine that the rock worker had changed to {{advantage}} since she first saw him. His keen eyes, which she had noticed were quick to flash with anger, had grown more kindly and the bronzed face was more reposeful. The thin jean garments and great <b>knee</b> <b>boots,</b> which had no longer any rents in them, suited the well-proportioned frame.|$|E
60|$|We had our pirate cave away {{up among}} the rocks, where we kept an old pistol with the lock broken, a rusty cutlass, {{a pair of}} <b>knee</b> <b>boots,</b> and Claude's jute beard and wig. Down on the shore, {{around one of the}} horns of the Half Moon, was the Mermaid's Pool, where we sailed our toy boats and watched for sea kelpies. We never saw any. Dick says {{there is no such thing}} as a kelpy. But then Dick has no imagination. It is no {{argument}} against a thing that you've never seen it. I have never seen the pyramids, either, but I know that there are pyramids.|$|E
60|$|As {{they left}} the tent they found {{the rest of their}} party, {{gathered}} in a group twenty yards away, and the heartiest greeting was exchanged. The delight of the party knew no bounds when they found that their four friends had not had their journey in vain. They had two tents between them, and gathering in one of them they listened to Peters, who told the story, as Chris said he had told it twice, and should probably have to tell it again. The four lads at once exchanged their civilian clothes for the uniforms that had been brought up. They were, like those of the other Colonial corps, very simple, consisting of a loose jacket reaching down to the hip, with turned-down collar and pockets, breeches of the same light colour and material, loose to the knee and tighter below it; <b>knee</b> <b>boots,</b> and felt hats looped up on one side.|$|E

50|$|Carriage {{passengers}} {{often used}} a lap robe as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A buffalo robe, {{made from the}} hide of an American bison dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A carriage boot, fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A <b>knee</b> <b>boot</b> protected the <b>knees</b> from rain or splatter.|$|R
60|$|He {{lay in a}} {{dilapidated}} chair beside the stove, and the little bare room through which its pipe ran was permeated {{with the smell of}} fresh shavings, hot iron, and the fumes of indifferent tobacco. A carpenter's bench ran along one end of it, and was now occupied by a new wagon pole the man had fashioned out of a slender birch. A Marlin rifle, an ax, and a big saw hung beneath the head of an antelope on the wall above the bench, and all of them showed signs of use and glistened with oil. Opposite to them a few shelves were filled with simple crockery and cooking utensils, and these also shone spotlessly. There was a pair of <b>knee</b> <b>boots</b> in one corner with a patch partly sewn on to one of them, and the harness in another showed traces of careful repair. A bookcase hung above them, and its somewhat tattered contents indicated that the man who had chosen and evidently handled them frequently, possessed tastes any one who did not know that country would scarcely have expected to find in a prairie farmer. A table and one or two rude chairs made by their owner's hands completed the furniture, but while all hinted at poverty, it also suggested neatness, industry and care, for the room bore the impress of its occupier's individuality as rooms not infrequently do.|$|E

Her family was embarrassed by her legs, suggesting she hide them as they wondered aloud which of their Ukrainian ancestors had provided the genes for such an embarrassment, but Olinekova promised, [...] "Someday people will pay to see these legs." ...|$|R
50|$|Boot socks {{can be worn}} {{for comfort}} or for fashion.The turn up of trousers, showing a dash of the boot sock is a trend which has been {{highlighted}} by various fashion sources. Rolling the boot socks down in a scruffy way adds a unique touch to a look. Boot socks are also used for the obvious function of warmth and comfort. Also boot socks are worn with <b>knee</b> high <b>boots</b> and <b>knee</b> high riding <b>boots</b> with <b>knee</b> length or over the <b>knee</b> length <b>boot</b> socks. The socks are worn alone or over tights. leggings or jeans and are scrunched {{at the top of}} the boots. This style of wearing boot socks is fashionable with young girls, tweens, teens, college age girls and women. Boots are seen as hard wearing footwear and aren't as comfortable to wear as most shoes,so wearing a decent sock is crucial. Wearing the boot socks have become popular with the Wellington Boot, hiking boots and wearing them for any other sporting activity involving walking long distances.|$|R

Boys wear blue jeans and black dress-shoes with their jackets and shirts, while girls wear blue denim miniskirts and black knee-boots.

50|$|Fashion boots {{generally}} {{employ the}} same range of soles and heels as {{are found in}} shoes. The defining character of the boot is {{the length of the}} shaft. Ankle boots generally have a shaft height of less than 8 inches (20 cm), calf-length boots 8-15 inches (20-38 cm), knee-length boots 15-19 inches (38-48 cm), while over-the <b>knee</b> <b>boots</b> have shaft lengths of 19 inches (38 cm) or more; however these divisions are arbitrary and at the boundaries the decision as to whether a boot is, for example, calf-length or knee-length is largely subjective.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycle {{boots are}} {{associated}} with motorcycle riders and range from above ankle to below <b>knee</b> <b>boots.</b> They have an outside of a typical boot but a low heel to control the motorcycle.To improve motorcycle safety, motorcycle boots are generally made from a thick, heavy leather and may include energy absorbing and load spreading padding, metal, plastic and/or composite materials to protect the motorcycle rider's feet, ankles and legs in an accident. For use in wet weather, some boots have a waterproof membrane lining such as Gore-Tex or SympaTex.|$|E
50|$|On {{formation}} the Rangers {{adopted the}} uniform of the Kings Royal Rifle Corps (KKRC), a Rifle green tunic with scarlet facings (except the KRRC's scarlet piping down {{the front edge of}} the tunic). A black Shako was worn with a black ball tuft and a silver plated shako plate bearing an eight-pointed star with a bugle, the number XL and the motto Excel, surmounted by a bronzed crown. The waist belt, pouch and bayonet frog were in black leather. Until 1875, dismounted as well as mounted officers wore leather <b>knee</b> <b>boots</b> with the trousers tucked into them. The Pioneers wore a Bearskin of the Guards' pattern.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} years of {{national}} parks (1870's and 1880s), before there was such an organization as the United States National Park Service, there was no specific unifying dress code for employees. The man credited with being the first park ranger, Harry Yount, wore clothing typical of the late 19th century outdoorsmen. Civilian shirts and wide brimmed hats were mixed and matched with a U.S. Army coat, <b>knee</b> <b>boots,</b> and a variety of buckskin items and animal hide trousers. The employees who came after him followed suit, combining old Army uniforms with civilian clothes, making it hard to distinguish who was a guardian, and who was not. It was not until 1886, fourteen years after the first park was officially dedicated in 1872, that an official organization with a unifying outfit would begin to take over.|$|E

Methods: A 5 year retrospective analysis of 50 patients presenting with an acute CN, Assessing time to clinical resolution into appropriate footwear and assessing if initial immobilisation device influenced resolution time. Results: During the study period 42 patients (84 %) of patients went into remission, 2 died during their treatment, 4 had major amputations, in 2 patients treatment was ongoing. 36 patients were treated with combination offloading devices, 6 were treated with one modality only. Median time to resolution for patients initially treated with a TCC was not significantly shorter than for those treated with a removable below <b>knee</b> <b>boot.</b> 34. 9 % required re-casting due to clinical deterioration in the removable device. Conclusions: More precise measures of resolution of CN are needed {{to assess the impact of}} initial treatment modality on time to resolution...|$|R
