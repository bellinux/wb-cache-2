2500|$|Since {{structural}} columns {{are commonly}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>length,</b> the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty {{in the behavior of}} columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 [...] 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load Fmax given by: ...|$|E
