In this procedure, cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin or cisplatin with lipiodol are administered and the arteries supplying the liver are blocked by <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> or other particles. Because most systemic drugs have no efficacy in the treatment of HCC, research into the molecular pathways involved in the production of liver cancer produced sorafenib, a targeted therapy drug that prevents cell proliferation and blood cell growth. Sorafenib obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007. This drug provides a survival benefit for advanced HCC.|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{transglutaminase}} (mTG) {{was used}} as a crosslinking agent in the preparation of <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges.</b> The physical properties of the materials were evaluated by measuring their material porosity, water absorption, and elastic modulus. The stability of the sponges were assessed via hydrolysis and enzymolysis. To study the material degradation in vivo, subcutaneous implantations of sponges were performed on rats for 1 – 3 months, and the implanted sponges were analyzed. To evaluate the cell compatibility of the mTG crosslinked <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> (mTG sponges), adipose-derived stromal stem cells were cultured and inoculated into the scaffold. Cell proliferation and viability were measured using alamarBlue assay and LIVE/DEAD fluorescence staining, respectively. Cell adhesion on the sponges was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that mTG sponges have uniform pore size, high porosity and water absorption, and good mechanical properties. In subcutaneous implantation, the material was partially degraded in the first month and completely absorbed in the third month. Cell experiments showed evident cell proliferation and high viability. Results also showed that the cells grew vigorously and adhered tightly to the sponge. In conclusion, mTG sponge has good biocompatibility and can be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform a number of {{preliminary}} in vitro evaluations on an array of modified <b>gelatin</b> gel <b>sponge</b> scaffolds for use in a bone graft application. The gelatin gels were modified through the addition of a number of components which each possess unique properties conducive to the creation and regeneration of bone: a preparation rich in growth factors (PRGF, a bioactive, lyophilized form of platelet-rich plasma), hydroxyapatite, and chitin whiskers. Platelet-rich plasma therapy is an emerging practice that has proven effective in a number of clinical applications, including enhancing bone repair through improved deposition of new bony matrix and angiogenesis. As such, the inclusion of PRGF in our gelatin scaffolds was intended to significantly enhance scaffold bioactivity, while the addition of hydroxyapatite and chitin whiskers were anticipated to increase scaffold strength. Additionally, the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges,</b> which readily dissolve in aqueous solutions, were subjected to 1 -Ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) cross-linking, either during or post-gelation, to control their rate of degradation.

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that not all children with aural atresia are candidates for atresia repair. Candidacy for atresia surgery is based on the hearing test (audiogram) and CT scan imaging. If a canal is built where one does not exist, minor complications can arise from the body's natural tendency to heal an open wound closed. Repairing aural atresia is a very detailed and complicated surgical procedure which requires an expert in atresia repair. [...] While complications from this surgery can arise, the risk of complications is greatly reduced when using a highly experienced otologist. Atresia patients who opt for surgery will temporarily have the canal packed with <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> and silicone sheeting to prevent closure. The timing of ear canal reconstruction (canalplasty) depends on the type of external ear (Microtia) repair desired by the patient and family. Two surgical teams in the USA are currently able to reconstruct the canal at the same time as the external ear in a single surgical stage (one stage ear reconstruction).|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{investigated}} whether {{bone morphogenetic protein}} 2, released {{slowly from}} a <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge,</b> could induce cartilage regeneration in a canine model of tracheomalacia and evaluated the long-term results. MethodsA 1 × 5 -cm gap {{was made in the}} anterior cervical trachea by removing 5 -cm long strips of 10 sequential cartilagines. In the control group (n = 5), the gaps were left untreated. In the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> group (n = 5), a <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> soaked in a buffer solution was implanted in each defect. In the bone morphogenetic protein group (n = 5), a <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> soaked in a buffer solution containing 12 μg bone morphogenetic protein 2 was implanted in each defect. ResultsTracheomalacia was observed in the control and <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> groups but not in the bone morphogenetic protein group. No regenerated cartilage was detected in the control or <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> groups, even 6 months after surgery. In contrast, regenerated cartilage, which had developed from the host perichondrium, was observed around the stumps of the resected cartilagines in the bone morphogenetic protein group. This regenerated cartilage maintained the integrity of the internal lumen for longer than 6 months. A compressive fracture test revealed that the tracheal cartilage in the bone morphogenetic protein group was significantly more stable than that in the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> and control groups (P =. 0015 and P =. 0001, respectively). ConclusionsIn this canine model of tracheomalacia, cartilage regeneration was induced around the stumps of tracheal cartilagines by bone morphogenetic protein 2 released slowly from a <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge.</b> This regenerated cartilage was not reabsorbed for longer than 6 months and was strong enough to maintain the integrity of the internal lumen of the trachea...|$|E

Subjects and Methods The subjects comprised 278 participants who underwent transrectal prostate needle biopsy. They were randomly allocated to the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> insertion group (group A: 148 participants) and to the non-insertion group (group B: 130 participants). In group A, the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> was inserted into the rectum immediately after biopsy. A biopsy-induced hemorrhage {{was defined as a}} case in which a subject complained of bleeding from the rectum, and excretion of blood clots was confirmed. A blood test was performed before and after biopsy, and a questionnaire survey was given after the biopsy. Results Significantly fewer participants in group A required hemostasis after biopsy compared to group B (3 (2. 0 %) vs. 11 (8. 5 %), P= 0. 029). The results of the blood tests and the responses from the questionnaire did not differ significantly between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, only &# 8220;insertion of a <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> into the rectum&# 8221; emerged as a significant predictor of hemostasis.

40|$|The {{application}} of freeze-dried <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> as alternative bone grafting substitutes has many advantages, including {{the ability to}} swell, high porosity, tailorable degradation, and versatility to incorporate multiple components such as growth factors and nanofillers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to mineralize (M) and further characterize 1 -Ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) cross-linked <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> enhanced with preparations rich in growth factors, hydroxyapatite, and chitin whiskers (PHCE). Sponges were characterized for their swelling and in vitro mineralization potential, surface characteristics, protein release, mechanical properties, and MG- 63 cell attachment and infiltration. All sponges swelled up to 50 % of their original volume upon hydration. Scanning electron microscopy showed sparse mineral deposition for gelatin-M scaffolds while PHCE-M scaffolds exhibited more uniform mineral nucleation. Over 21 days, PHCE-M scaffolds cumulatively released significantly more (30 %) of its initial protein content than all other scaffolds. PHCE-M scaffolds reported lower modulus values (1. 3 – 1. 6 MPa) when compared to gelatin control scaffolds (1. 6 – 3. 2 MPa). Increased cell attachment and infiltration was noticed on PHCE and PHCE-M scaffolds. The results of the study demonstrate the enhanced performance of PHCE and PHCE-M scaffolds to serve as bone healing scaffolds. Their potential to release incorporated factors, comparable composition/mechanical properties to tissues developed in the early stages of bone healing, and enhanced initial cellular response make them suitable for further studies evaluating more complex cellular interactions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{lymphatic system}} {{controls}} tissue homeostasis by draining protein-rich lymph to the vascular system. Lymphangiogenesis, {{the formation of}} lymphatic vessels, is a normal event in childhood but promotes tumor spread and metastasis during adulthood. Blocking lymphangiogenesis may therefore be of therapeutic interest. Production of adenosine is enhanced in the tumor environment and contributes to tumor progression through stimulation of angiogenesis. In this study, we determined whether adenosine affects lymphangiogenesis. METHODS: Lymphatic endothelial cells (HMVEC-dLy) were cultured in presence of adenosine and their proliferation, migration and tube formation was assessed. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> embedded with the stable analogue of adenosine 2 -chloro adenosine were implanted in mice ear and lymphangiogenesis was quantified. Mice were intravenously injected with adenoviruses containing expression vector for 5 '-endonucleotidase, which {{plays a major role}} in the formation of adenosine. RESULTS: In vitro, we observed that adenosine decreased the proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells, their migration and tube formation. However, in vivo, <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> containing 2 -chloro adenosine and implanted in mice ear displayed an elevated level of lymphangiogenesis (2. 5 -fold, p< 0. 001). Adenovirus-mediated over-expression of cytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase IA stimulated lymphangiogenesis and the recruitment of macrophages in mouse liver. Proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells was enhanced (2 -fold, p< 0. 001) when incubated in the presence of conditioned medium from murine macrophages. CONCLUSION: We have shown that adenosine stimulates lymphangiogenesis in vivo, presumably through a macrophage-mediated mechanism. This observation suggests that blockade of adenosine receptors may help in anti-cancer therapies. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Methods: This is an in vitro study comparing polyvinyl alcohol triangular sponges (TS 6, TS 8), polyvinyl alcohol fluid wicks (EFW), and absorbable <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> (AGS 3, AGS 5), from which five different types of transport units were obtained. Seven pieces of sponge of each transport unit type were obtained as follows: two transverse strips were obtained at 6 and 8  mm from the apex of TS and divided into three equal pieces; 4 × 4  mm pieces of EFW; 3 × 3 and 5 × 5  mm pieces of absorbable <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> were cut. Filter paper was placed on a precision scale (0. 01  mg). The seven sponge pieces of each type were weighed three times consecutively in dry and wet states, the latter after immersion for 15  seconds in 0. 2  mg/mL MMC. The difference between the weights of the dry and wet filter paper at the end of each measurement sequence was also calculated and considered as an estimate of the amount of mitomycin delivered. Results: The amounts of MMC absorbed by each transport unit were as follows: (mean ± standard deviation) 27. 43 ± 5. 13 for TS 6, 31. 91 ± 6. 63 for TS 8, 15. 96 ± 2. 23 for EFW, 17. 96 ± 2. 05 for AGS 3, and 33. 81 ± 2. 05 for AGS 5. The amounts of MMC delivered to the filter paper were as follows: 21. 70 ± 2. 84 for TS 6, 23. 83 ± 4. 03 for TS 8, 12. 93 ± 1. 75 for EFW, 14. 69 ± 1. 79 for AGS 3, and 27. 30 ± 1. 58 for AGS 5.

In conclusion, we suggest arterial embolization {{to be a viable}} option for first-line treatment in the management of vulvovaginal hematomas...|$|R
40|$|Background Many {{data suggest}} that the density of mast cells is highly {{correlated}} with the extent of both normal and pathological angiogenesis. Objective In this study we have compared in an in vivo assay, the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, the angiogenic potential of mast cell suspensions isolated from rats, degranulated mast cells and their secretory granules. Methods <b>Gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> adsorbed with cell suspensions of rat mast cells, degranulated mast cells and their secretory granules were implanted {{on the top of the}} chorioallantoic membrane at day 8 of incubation. At day 12 the angiogenic response was evaluated macroscopically, microscopically and by a morphometric method of 'point counting'. Results Isolated mast cells and their secretory granules, but not degranulated mast cells, induced an angiogenic response in the chorioallantoic membrane. The addition of antifibroblast growth factor- 2 or antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies reduced the angiogenic response of both mast cells and their secretory granules by 50...|$|R
40|$|Effective therapies for the {{regeneration}} {{of large}} osteochondral defects are still lacking; however, various approaches have been used. We evaluated {{the efficacy of}} Escherichia coli-derived dimeric recombinant human BMP- 2 (E-rhBMP- 2) for the repair of large osteochondral defects in a rabbit model. Osteochondral defects made in the femoral patellar groove of the knee were treated by transplanting <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> onto which no or various doses of E-rhBMP- 2 were loaded. The outcomes were {{compared with those of}} an untreated control group four, 12 and 24  weeks after transplantation. At early time points, the cartilage tissue was repaired in a dose-dependent manner, and bone repair was accelerated in the defects treated with high doses of E-rhBMP- 2. At 24  weeks, the repair of cartilage tissue was better with E-rhBMP- 2 treatment, even at low doses, than without E-rhBMP- 2 treatment. Our findings suggest that the use of E-rhBMP- 2 improves and accelerates the repair of osteochondral defects in a rabbit model...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesWalter C. RenbergObjective: To {{compare the}} in vitro elution {{characteristics}} of six common analgesic medications from a commercially available absorbable <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge.</b> Study Design: Experimental study. Methods: Gelatin sponges were loaded with various analgesic medications, including two opioids, preservative-free morphine and fentanyl, two local anesthestics, bupivacaine and lidocaine, and two α 2 -adrenergic agonists, dexmedetomidine and xylazine. The loaded sponges {{were placed in}} dishes containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and maintained at 37 ° C with constant agitation. Concentrations of each drug were determined at various time points up to 24 hours post-inoculation using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Two phases were conducted, utilizing undried loaded sponges (phase one) and dried loaded sponges (phase two). Results: In both phases, all analgesic medications eluted from the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> and equilibrated rapidly with the PBS, achieving maximal concentration within 30 minutes. In phase two, the rapid nature of the release was captured by increasing sampling within the initial 30 minutes. Results were consistent for each medication with minimal variation. Steady state concentrations were significantly higher in phase two with four out of six medications. Conclusions: Analgesic medication elution from an absorbable <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> was rapid and consistent. Drying the loaded sponge prior to use will likely substantially {{increase the amount of}} medication eluted but not prolong release. Clinical Relevance: The rapid release of analgesic medications from the <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> makes a prolonged analgesic effect unlikely without further modification. Toxicity may be a concern. Further study is required to investigate efficacy in vivo, safe dosing regimens and prolongation of duration of action...|$|E
30|$|Jiang et al. (2011) {{guessed that}} the low {{frequency}} of pulmonary infarction {{and the absence}} of ischemic complications following TAE are likely explained by the abundant available collateral circulation from the bronchial, intercostal, inferior phrenic, and other nearby arteries. However, Abe et al. (2011) noted that compensatory enlarged bronchial arteries may become collateral vessels to the affected lung and cause risk of recurrent hemoptysis. Moreover, Rubin et al. (1994) reported a case of fatal massive hemoptysis associated with anomalous systemic arterial supply to the basal lung by vulnerable anomalous artery breakdown. Delivery of a large amount of thin <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> particles may induce pulmonary infarction. The small amount of relatively large-sized (2  mm) <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> particles used in our case might not only reduce the risk of reperfusion to distal anomalous arteries from collateral vessels but also reduce the number of embolic coils needed. Therefore, we used <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> particles because we believe that their use to embolize distal arteries reduces the risk of recurrence. Although we experienced pulmonary infarction as a complication, the lesion was localized and conservative treatment was feasible, which caused no major adverse events in our patient. In fact, there are a few reports of complications after TAE of the anomalous systemic arterial supply, and these were treated with conservative management (Jiang et al. 2011). Additionally, in examining the possibility of such complications, it was certainly necessary that bronchial angiography be performed to evaluate the vascularity of the lung parenchyma. However, it might be better to avoid the use of <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> particles in patients with a similar anomaly without pulmonary artery distribution because of the possibility of causing severe pulmonary infarction.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This Phase 3, international, randomized, single-blind, {{controlled}} trial (FINISH- 3) {{compared the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} Fibrocaps, a ready-to-use, dry-powder fibrin sealant containing human plasma-derived thrombin and fibrinogen, vs <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> alone {{for use as a}} hemostat for surgical bleeding in 4 indications (ie, spinal, hepatic, vascular, soft tissue dissection). STUDY DESIGN: Adults with mild to moderate surgical bleeding (randomized 2 : 1; Fibrocaps vs <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge)</b> were treated at a single bleeding site (day 1). Time to hemostasis (TTH) during 5 minutes was compared (log-rank statistic) within each indication. Safety follow-up continued to day 29. RESULTS: Patients were treated (Fibrocaps, n = 480; <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge,</b> n = 239) when undergoing spinal (n = 183), vascular (n = 175), hepatic (n = 180), or soft-tissue (n = 181) procedures. Fibrocaps was applied by spray device in 53 % of all procedures (94 % of hepatic and soft-tissue procedures). Fibrocaps significantly reduced TTH compared with gelatin sponge; estimated hazard ratios were 3. 3, 2. 1, 2. 3, and 3. 4 for the 4 surgical indications, respectively (each p < 0. 001; primary end point). Fibrocaps significantly reduced median TTH for each indication (p < 0. 001) and was superior for secondary efficacy end points of restricted mean TTH (p < 0. 001) and probability of hemostasis at 3 (p < 0. 001) and 5 (p CONCLUSIONS: Fibrocaps was well tolerated and significantly reduced TTH relative to <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponge</b> alone in all 4 surgical indications. These findings demonstrate the broad utility of Fibrocaps as a hemostatic agent for mild to moderate surgical bleeding. ((C) 2015 by the American College of Surgeons...|$|E
40|$|The topical haemostatic {{agents have}} been {{developed}} to be used as adjunctive measures to promote haemostasis. These include bone wax, absorbable gel sponges, microfibrillar collagen, oxidised regenerated cellulose, <b>gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> with thrombin, gelatin-thrombin matrix sealant or fibrin sealants. Gelatin-thrombin matrix sealant is a mixture of a bovine-derived gelatin matrix and human-derived thrombin component that are mixed together at the time of use. This agent {{has been found to be}} more effective haemostat than thrombin-soaked gelatine sponges. The possible adverse effects of this can be transmission of diseases from human or bovine sources, allergic reactions, thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), perilesional oedema, and compression of neural tissue. Although it is used routinely in the operating room, there is little literature available on the perioperative implications with use of intraoperative gelatin-thrombin matrix sealant. Here, we present clinical report of 20 neurosurgical patients where the sealant was used and literature in view of current evidence has been reviewed...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{bilateral}} renal angiomyolipoma without tuberous sclerosis is reported. A 49 -year-old woman {{was admitted to}} the general practitioner with a sudden onset of severe left flank pain. An excretory urogram and ultrasonogram revealed an enlargement of the left kidney. She was subsequently referred to our clinic for further investigation and treatment. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging using Tl-weighted image showed several tumors with a fatty, dense area in the bilateral kidney. An arteriogram demonstrated a hypervascular renal mass with aneurysms in her left kidney. Diagnosis {{of bilateral}} renal angiomyolipoma was confirmed by percutaneous needle biopsy. Superselective embolization of the tumor was successfully performed, preserving normal renal tissue. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> containing Carboquone (CQ sponge) were used as embolic material. Angiomyolipoma has become relatively easy to diagnose by CT, ultrasound, MRI and so on. However, there are some cases of angiomyolipoma which are indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma using these modes of testing. Therefore, in selecting a conservative management, we indicated that percutaneous biopsy or open biopsy should be done to confirm the results of the above procedures. Moreover, therapeutic embolization for angiomyolipoma was concluded to be very useful...|$|R
40|$|Aim Due {{to a lack}} of {{regenerative}} potential, current {{treatments for}} periodontal defects do not always provide satisfactory clinical results. Previously, the implantation of a biomaterial scaffold-cell construct has been suggested as a clinically achievable approach. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the contribution of implanted periodontal ligament (PDL) cells to periodontal tissue regeneration. Materials & Methods <b>Gelatin</b> <b>sponges</b> were seeded with green fluorescent protein (GFP) transfected PDL or gingival fibroblasts (GF) cells, and implanted into a surgically created rat intrabony periodontal defect model. After six weeks, decalcified maxillae were used for histomorphometrical and immunohistochemical analyses. Results After six weeks, animals that had received the PDL cells exhibited significantly more functional bone and ligament. Furthermore, there were remarkable differences in the distribution of the transplanted cells. Periodontal ligament cells were always located directly lining the newly regenerated areas. In contrast, GF cells dispersed over the whole defect area, and did not provide a favourable effect on the regeneration of the periodontal tissues. Conclusion We concluded that PDL cells transplanted into a periodontal defect survive and favour regeneration of periodontium, possibly in a paracrine manner...|$|R
