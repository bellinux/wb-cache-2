5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Paul Neurath {{approached}} EA {{to discuss a}} port of Ultima Underworld to the Pocket PC. EA rejected the suggestion, but allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for possible developers; Neurath found that ZIO Interactive enthusiastically supported the idea, and EA eventually licensed {{the rights to the}} company. Doug Church and Floodgate Entertainment assisted with portions of its Pocket PC development, and the port was released in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Various {{candidates}} were put forward {{as a possible}} wife for Ernest. His own father wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> high-up for a wife, such as a Russian grand duchess. One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans, a daughter of Louis Philippe I, whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries. Such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism however, and consequently nothing came of it. She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina as a possible husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain, and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the speech}} the President said:"If there is anyone who still wonders why {{this war is}} being fought, let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Norway. If there is anyone who has any {{delusions}} that this war could have been averted, let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Norway; {{and if there is}} anyone who doubts the democratic will to win, again I say, let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Norway." ...|$|R

It will {{be bad for}} {{him when}} men he has injured, and at whom he has jeered, are {{thinking}} of getting hanged. Let HIM get ready for HIS fate, when that comes about. There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of, or he wouldn't have had brains enough to say it. Let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> it; let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> it! When men he has wronged, and on whom he has bestowed his insolence, {{are getting ready to}} be hanged, there is a death-bell ringing. And not for them.' ...|$|R

5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E
5|$|Though Henry Beecher's Lawrenceburg church {{declared}} {{its independence from}} the Synod to retain him as its pastor, the poverty that followed the Panic of 1837 caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a new position. Banker Samuel Merrill invited Beecher to visit Indianapolis in 1839, and he was offered the ministry of the Second Presbyterian Church there on May 13, 1839. Unusually for a speaker of his era, Beecher would use humor and informal language including dialect and slang as he preached. His preaching was a major success, building Second Presbyterian into the largest church in the city, and he also led a successful revival meeting in nearby Terre Haute. However, mounting debt led to Beecher again seeking a new position in 1847, and he accepted the invitation of businessman Henry Bowen to head a new Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher's national fame continued to grow, and he took to the lecture circuit, {{becoming one of the}} most popular speakers in the country and charging correspondingly high fees.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix's {{investigation}} brings <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into {{an incident}} seven years ago, in which Athena's mother Metis {{was killed and}} Blackquill was convicted for the murder. With one day until Blackquill's planned execution, his sister Aura takes several people hostage, including Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy, demanding that a re-trial of the case is held to convict Athena for Metis's murder. Upon receiving a letter from Maya Fey, Phoenix decides to hold the trial in the courtroom destroyed in the earlier bombing. Together with chief prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix deduces that a third party {{was responsible for the}} murder, proving Athena's and Blackquill's innocence. Edgeworth declares Blackquill a free man, and places him back in charge as prosecutor for the case while he retrieves vital information. Phoenix learns that the true culprit behind both Metis's and Clay's murders was the Phantom, an international spy that has disguised himself as the deceased Fulbright. The Phantom posed as Fulbright to steal evidence to conceal his true identity, fearing he will be killed by his enemies should it be revealed. With the assistance of Edgeworth, Blackquill, Apollo and Athena, Phoenix manages to break the normally emotionless Phantom, after which the Phantom is shot by an unseen sniper. After proving the Phantom's guilt and Athena's innocence and bringing an end to the dark age, the Wright Anything Agency sees Solomon off as he heads into space.|$|E

25|$|Dirac's {{first step}} into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925. Ralph Fowler, his {{research}} supervisor, had received a proof copy of an exploratory paper by Werner Heisenberg {{in the framework of}} the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld. Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into this paper carefully.|$|E

At the next restrictor-plate race at Talladega Superspeedway, he won his first career Cup pole position, but finished last due to mechanical issues. After winning a second career pole at Talladega, he was only able to improve his points position by five spots. At the end of the year, sponsorship problems at Melling forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> elsewhere for a job.|$|E
25|$|Dark Fall was written, {{designed}} and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, {{who was working}} as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, {{and he was able to}} get inside and explore the buffet room.|$|E

25|$|Different {{soldiers}} appeared carrying another person, {{whom the}} grand dukes finally recognized as their cousin Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich. They were then each escorted {{arm in arm}} with a soldier on each side towards a trench that had been dug in the courtyard. As they passed the cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul where their ancestors were buried, the grand dukes crossed themselves. The prisoners were lined up before the ditch, in which there were already thirteen bodies. Nicholas Mikhailovich, who had been carrying his cat, handed it to a soldier, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after it. All of the grand dukes faced death with the greatest courage. George and Dimitri prayed quietly. Grand Duke Paul, who was very sick, was shot on a stretcher. Grand Dukes Nicholas, George and Dimitri {{were killed by the}} same blast. The fusillade of shots sent them reeling into the ditch.|$|E
25|$|However, in January 1989, Colin's health deteriorates, and Legg finally {{reveals that}} he has MS. Colin is furious at Legg for lying and threatens to report him to the authorities.

Problems arise in Colin and Guido's relationship in 1989; Colin begins to believe that Guido is only staying with him out of pity. Colin decides to move to his brother's in Bristol. He opts not to tell Guido that he is going, but a surprise visit from Barry stalls his departure and Guido comes home to see Colin packed and ready to leave. Colin tells Guido that he needs some space and asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after his flat while he sorts himself out. He then leaves Walford whilst his friends wave him goodbye.|$|E
25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her two sons and for him to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He buried her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E
