Kennedy and that they smoked {{marijuana}} in a White House bedroom. According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a Secret Service agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom. He stated that Meyer and Kennedy regularly met in that manner, sometimes {{two or three times}} each week, until his assassination. Truitt said the two would [...] "usually have drinks or dinner alone or sometimes with one of the aides", and claimed that Meyer offered marijuana cigarettes to Kennedy after one such meeting on April 16, 1962. He said after they smoked three joints she commented, [...] "This isn't like cocaine. I'll <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> of that." [...] According to the Enquirer, Meyer also kept a diary of the affair. The paper quoted Tony Bradlee — Meyer's sister — as confirming the existence of the affair and the diary, stating that Bradlee found the diary in Meyer's studio after her death, then turned it over to James Jesus Angleton who subsequently burned it at CIA headquarters.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Tulsa World Walker said, [...] "I approached the second album {{a little bit differently}} from the first one, because it's kind of like scuba diving, the first time, you're down there at the bottom, and it's a little bit dirty, so you have to feel around a lot before you can find the treasure. For the second one, the water was a little more clear." [...] He also said, [...] "The only thing I try to do is just look for good songs, and not worry about what kind they are. I think if you do that, it does two things: It <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> hits on radio, and it gives the listener a little variety." ...|$|R
