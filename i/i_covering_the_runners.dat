This paper studies the time-varying formation tracking for multiple manipulator systems (MMSs) under fixed and switching directed graphs with a dynamic leader, whose acceleration cannot change too fast. An explicit mathematical formulation of time-varying formation is developed based on the related practical applications. A class of extended inverse dynamics control algorithms combining with distributed sliding-mode estimators are developed to address the aforementioned problem. By invoking finite-time stability arguments, several novel criteria (including sufficient criteria, necessary and sufficient criteria) for global finite-time stability of MMSs are established. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results...|$|R

40|$|Landfill design {{requires}} a low permeability closure cap {{as well as}} a low permeability liner. The Savannah River Site, in South Carolina, has approximately 85 acres of mixed waste landfills covered with compacted kaolin clay. Maintaining low permeability of the clay cap requires both that the permeability of the compacted clay itself remain low and that the integrity of the barrier be maintained. Barrier breaches typically result from penetration by roots or animals, and especially cracks caused by uneven settling or desiccation. In this study, clay layers, 0. 81 m in diameter and 7. 6 cm thick, were compacted in 7 lysimeters to simulate closure caps. The hydraulic conductivity of each layer was measured, and the compacted clay layers (CCL`s) were cracked by drying. Then various repair techniques were applied and the effectiveness of each repair was assessed by remeasuring the hydraulic conductivity. Finally the repaired CCL was again dried and measured to determine how the repair responded to the conditions that caused the original failure. For a full report of this investigation see Persoff et al. Six repair techniques have been tested, four of which involve the use of injectable barrier liquids colloidal silica (CS) and polysiloxane (PSX) described below: (<b>I)</b> <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> crack with a bentonite geosynthetic clay liner (GCL), (ii) recompaction of new kaolinite at STD+ 3 moisture content joined to existing kaolinite that had dried and shrunk, (iii) direct injection of colloidal silica to a crack, (iv) injection of colloidal silica (CS) to wells in an overlying sand layer, (v) direct injection of polysiloxane to a crack, and (vi), injection of polysiloxane (PSX) to wells in an overlying soil layer...|$|R

40|$|Freshly {{prepared}} acid-cleaned biosilica of 21 different diatom {{species was}} studied {{using a combination}} of wide, small, and ultrasmall angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS, SAXS, and USAXS) in order to determine whether the structural and fractal properties from the subnanometer level up to dimensions of several microns are species-specific, and if so to quantify them. WAXS data are in line with the amorphous nature of this kind of biosilica: no Bragg reflections were observed at the level below 1 nm. Straight domains in the scattering spectra (in both SAXS and USAXS) revealed the presence of different fractal regions with highly species-specific transition points, as part of the surface structure. All silica specimens had four of these fractal regions, but with a length scale per region characteristic for each specimen except for <b>the</b> region (Region <b>I)</b> <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> WAXS domain (d 396 nm), revealed the roughest surface. Transition points between straight regions in the scattering spectra did relate to the dimension of meso- and macro-pores that are known to be present in diatom biosilica; the pore sizes determined from the spectra agreed with estimates made from electron micrographs. Interestingly, dominant scattering peaks were observed in USAXS, as if we were dealing with crystals as in highly ordered MCM-type silicas. This crystallinity was only apparent, not real; it is most probably due to the high regularity in pore distributions in diatom biosilica in the size range of 100 to similar to 500 nm. Our data show that diatom biosilica has quantifiable species-specific fractal surface properties, next to the well known species-specific pore architecture that is well beyond those of other well-ordered artificial silica materials. Consequently, it is likely that each also has its own surface pattern of reactive sites and in view of these large variations each diatom species potentially can be the source for the design of a different silica-based material...|$|R

Message propagation, either for emergency or pleasure purposes, constitutes a major category of VANET applications, and is particularly challenging in infrastructure-less vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenarios.

We first derive the exact expression for the average size of the connected components in the one-dimensional case, i. e., messages propagating along a main street, and give a close approximation to the size distribution.
