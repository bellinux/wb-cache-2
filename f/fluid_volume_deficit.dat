40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} the nursing interventions in the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) related to the real and risk situation for <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> <b>deficit</b> in trauma patients attended in a pre-hospital advanced unit. Methods: descriptive crossed mapping study, based on nurses’ description of the interventions and further refining. Approval {{was obtained from the}} Research Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo (0949 / 2008). Of the 39 nurses in the sector, 11 complied with the inclusion criteria: two years of work in pre-hospital advanced units and agreement to participate in the study. The data collection instrument comprised the subjects’ identification and space to include the activities performed in the real and risk situation for <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> <b>deficit</b> in trauma patients. The collected data were mapped comparatively and the adopted interventions were classified. This mapping was validated by experts. Results: 16 interventions and 59 activities were identified for the real situation, against 11 interventions and 37 activities for the risk situation. Conclusion: the activities of the adopted NIC interventions are performed in this context; we suggest adding the interventions "emergency care, emergency care and routing protocol for diagnosis” for the real and risk diagnosis, and the intervention "Supply management" for the <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> <b>deficit</b> diagnosis only...|$|E

40|$|Surgical fluid {{replacement}} is {{a critical}} issue in medicine as the <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> excess or <b>deficit</b> can both complicate the patient 2 ̆ 7 s condition. Currently, the administration of <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> is carried out primarily based on the experience and expertise of the anaesthetist {{as there is no}} analytical method available to estimate the patient 2 ̆ 7 s fluid level. The development of a decision support system (DSS) to assist the anaesthetist in estimating the required fluid infusion rate fora particular patient {{has been the focus of}} the research work reported in this thesis. The DSS is developed based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) technique which is ideal for developing input/output models in an unstructured and imprecise environment. The fuzzy rules used in the DSS are derived automatically from the clinical data produced in surgical operations. The DSS employs a Multi Rule Base (MRB) learning scheme to adapt its model according to the significant variation in the physiological parameters of a patient. The performance of the developed algorithms is validated through experimental work using clinical data. The results obtained so far are encouraging...|$|R

She {{was referred to}} Cornell from her primary veterinarian following a six day history of mastitis, weakness, anorexia and drop in milk production. On presentation she was febrile (105. 1 F), tachycardic (HR 96 beats/min), moderately dehydrated and had bilateral hemorrhagic sclerae. Her udder was warm, firm, hyperemic and asymmetrically swollen and her milk was yellow and watery with white flakes. Initial blood work revealed several hematological and biochemical abnormalities suggestive of systemic inflammation including an inflammatory leukogram.

40|$|Haemodynamic {{responses}} to graded haemorrhage were studied in unanaesthetized black ratsnakes (Elaphe 0. obsoleta) wherein fixed percentages {{of the blood}} volume were removed at regular intervals over periods which varied from one to several hours. Initially measured whole blood volumes averaged about 6 % of the body mass and were determined from plasma dilutions of Evans blue dye or the bleeding and washing out of red cells. In response to haemorrhage, heart rate increased, haematocrit decreased, plasma protein concentration decreased, and arterial pressure remained relatively constant until a critical blood loss at which pressure dropped precipitously. Critical <b>volume</b> <b>deficits</b> occurred at the withdrawal of 63 - 122 % of the initially measured blood volume. It appears that cardiovascular reflexes assist the regulation of arterial pressure during haemorrhage; additionally, there occurs a progressive and significant restitution of plasma volume owing to the absorption of extravascular <b>fluid.</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>volumes</b> absorbed by the circulation during haemorrhage replaced 20 - 71 % of the haemorrhaged blood loss and were correlated with {{the magnitude of the}} critical <b>volume</b> <b>deficit.</b> Body movements increased arterial pressure by improving venous cardiac return...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate rates of residual-limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change within one day for people with transtibial limb loss. Rates of <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change during 30 min test sessions of sitting, standing, and walking activities were measured twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, on 12 regular prosthesis users with the use of bioimpedance analysis. Between test sessions, all subjects consumed food and drink, and subject activity ranged from low to high. The rate of <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change within sessions ranged from − 8. 5 to 5. 9 %/h (median: − 2. 2 %/h). The rate of <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change between sessions ranged from − 2. 7 to 0. 9 %/h (median: − 1. 0 %/h).

Two different experimental protocols were used: hypervolemia (iv saline infusion, 0. 9 % NaCl, 20 ml/min, volume up to 5 % body weight) and controlled hemorrhage (up to a 50 % drop in mean arterial pressure). Mean ileocolonic flow (N = 6) was gradually and significantly decreased during the expansion (17. 1 %, P< 0. 05) and expanded (44. 9 %, P< 0. 05) periods while mean ileal flow (N = 7) was significantly decreased only during the expanded period (38 %, P< 0. 05). Mean colonic flow (N = 7) was decreased during expansion (12 %, P< 0. 05) but returned to control levels during the expanded period. Mean ileocolonic sphincter flow (N = 6) was not significantly modified. Mean ileocolonic flow (N = 10) was also decreased after hemorrhage (retracted period) by 17 % (P< 0. 05), but saline flow was not modified in the other separate circuits (N = 6, 5 and 4 for ileal, ileocolonic sphincter and colonic groups, respectively). The expansion effect was blocked by atropine (0. 5 mg/kg, iv) both on the ileocolonic (N = 6) and ileal (N = 5) circuits.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 INTRODUCTION: Over {{1 million}} Americans {{currently}} {{live with a}} lower limb amputation. Lower limb prostheses {{have been designed to}} produce a secure and comfortable fit between residual limb and prosthesis throughout the day. However, significant <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> fluctuations in the residual limb deteriorate socket fit and may cause decreased mobility due to discomfort or soft tissue injury from increased pressures and shear stresses. Extracellular fluid is thought to be the primary source of limb volume fluctuation and commonly decreases {{over the course of the}} day. Technologies designed to address limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss are ineffective and cumbersome. Methods to assess limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change are also poor, lacking the capability to quantify <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss at high temporal resolution and while the prosthesis is donned. METHODS: Bioimpedance analysis provides tools to rapidly estimate extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> while a subject performs regular activity with the prosthesis donned. Using a custom bioimpedance analyzer, we tested 16 subjects each on three separate occasions in a repeated measures study. Each test session consisted of an activity sequence followed by a 30 minute period of calm sitting (dubbed the recovery sit). During the recovery sit, subjects sat with their prosthesis donned (ON), prosthesis doffed (OFF), or liner donned (LINER). An identical activity sequence followed the 30 minute sit. RESULTS: Volume changes during the OFF 30 minute recovery sit were significantly higher than during ON (p < 0. 001). We observed that after the limb gained <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> during the OFF protocol, subsequent volume loss was negligible in 12 of 16 subjects during the following activity sequence. Conversely, volume lost during the 30 minute recovery period during ON was not recovered during three cycles of activity. During the LINER protocol, volume gains during the 30 minute sit were similar to those during OFF, but returned to baseline levels during subsequent activity. Gains in LINER during subsequent activity still remained elevated as compared to ON (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing applied pressure to the residual limb may function to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume,</b> allowing socket users to maintain a comfortable fit between limb and prosthesis. There exists a potential for development of socket technology that leverages pressure release to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{changes that}} occur in human fluid and {{electrolyte}} physiology during the acute and adaptive phases of adaptation to spaceflight are summarized. A number of questions remain to be answered. At a time when plasma <b>volume</b> and extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> are contracted and salt and water intake is unrestricted. ADH does not correct the <b>volume</b> <b>deficit</b> and serum sodium decreases. Change in secretion or activity of a natriuretic factor during spaceflight is one possible explanation. Recent identification of a polypeptide hormone produced in cardiac muscle cells which is natiuretic, is hypotensive, and has an inhibitory effect on renin and aldosterone secretion has renewed interest {{in the role of}} a natriuretic factor. The role of this atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in both long- and short-term variation in extracellular volumes and in the inability of the kidney to bring about an escape from the sodium-retaining state accompanying chronic cardiac dysfunction makes it reasonable to look for a role of ANF in the regulation of sodium during exposure to microgravity.
