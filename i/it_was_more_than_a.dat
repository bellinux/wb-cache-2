Before, their Marsaxlokk provenance had not been proposed by anyone, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> century later that the claim was discredited. The attribution to Tas-Silġ was apparently reached by inference, because the candelabra were thought, with some plausibility, to have been dedicated and set up inside the temple of Heracles.|$|E

She contacted Pokin to share Meier's story with him. Once the story broke, it quickly spread to national and international news outlets.|$|E

25|$|Franklin saw the {{printing}} press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> business venture, for like many publishers since, {{he believed that the}} press had a public-service duty.|$|E
25|$|A second thirty-minute {{practice}} session was held the following day, with Mortara setting the fastest time; the only driver {{to break into}} the 2:10s. His lap of 2:10.593, was an unofficial lap record as it was the fastest lap ever recorded at the Guia Circuit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> second under Marko Asmer's official lap record, set in 2007. Eight other drivers were also under the old mark, with tenth place Bianchi just outside the record. Ricciardo continued his fine form in second, despite not improving his time after a mid-session setup change. Bottas was third ahead of Hartley, Ericsson, Bird and the rest. Apart from an accident involving Chen at Maternity, this session passed relatively peacefully.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the siege}} of Louisbourg was the regiment's first battle, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> century before the War Office {{recognized}} the part they played. For decades, commanders of the regiment petitioned the War Office for the Louisbourg honour, which had been granted to the other eleven regiments present during the siege. However, the War Office continually refused, stating {{that there was no}} record of the regiment being present. This was true because the records which showed they were present were not held in the War Office. By acting as marines, they had been on the Royal Navy's books and thus the records verifying their part in the battle were held by the Admiralty. The regiment finally received the Louisbourg honour in 1910.|$|E

25|$|Ubisoft {{formally}} {{announced a}} return to online authentication on 9 February 2010, through its Uplay online gaming platform, starting with , , and Assassin's Creed II. Silent Hunter 5 was first reported to have been compromised within 24 hours of release, but users of the cracked version soon found out that only early parts of the game were playable. The Uplay system works by having the installed game on the local PCs incomplete and then continuously downloading parts of the game-code from Ubisoft's servers as the game progresses. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month after the PC release {{in the first week}} of April that software was released that could bypass Ubisoft's DRM in Assassin's Creed II. The software did this by emulating a Ubisoft server for the game. Later that month, a real crack was released that was able to remove the connection requirement altogether.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days prior}} to the start of Battleaxe, to help soften the Axis forces, the Royal Air Force was to bomb Benghazi while all {{aircraft}} capable of ground attack were to bomb Axis movement on the frontier. Once the battle began, fighters were to patrol defensively over Allied ground forces, while medium bombers were to stand by to engage Axis columns. Such was the priority on Battleaxe, that Arthur Tedder (Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Middle East) was instructed by the Chiefs of Staff to accept significant risks in other theatres by diverting all possible air support for it. Beresford-Peirse and Tedder established headquarters well to the rear, at Sidi Barrani and Maaten Baggush. Beresford-Peirse chose Sidi Barrani as, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> five-hour drive from the battlefield, it was equipped with the most advanced airfield for reconnaissance aircraft and was also the most forward position from which communications could be maintained with Maaten Baggush.|$|E
25|$|While the {{evolution}} of paramedicine described above is focused largely on the US, many other countries followed a similar pattern, although often with significant variations. Canada, for example, attempted a pilot paramedic training program at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1972. The program, which intended to upgrade the then mandatory 160 hours of training for ambulance attendants, {{was found to be}} too costly and premature. The program was abandoned after two years, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade before the legislative authority for its graduates to practice was put into place. An alternative program which provided 1,400 hours of training at the community college level prior to commencing employment was then tried, and made mandatory in 1977, with formal certification examinations being introduced in 1978. Similar programs occurred at roughly the same time in Alberta and British Columbia, with other Canadian provinces gradually following, but with their own education and certification requirements. Advanced Care Paramedics were not introduced until 1984, when Toronto trained its first group internally, before the process spread across the country. By 2010 the Ontario system involved a two-year community college based program, including both hospital and field clinical components, prior to designation as a Primary Care Paramedic, although it is starting to head towards a university degree-based program (for example, the joint degree in paramedicine offered by Centennial College and the University of Toronto). Some services, such as Toronto Paramedic Services, continue to train advanced care paramedics internally.|$|E

500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character.

Cristian Ritondo, legislator of the Republican Proposal, said that [...] "Alfonsín was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism". Gerardo Morales said that [...] "when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace. We were part of the collective project led by Alfonsín". Elisa Carrió pointed that she had political disputes with him, but respected him nonetheless. Julio César Strassera, judge of the trial of the juntas, hoped that Alfonsín would be remembered as a great democrat. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province, praised that he died with a complete peace of mind. Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, considered that he must have died in peace, after fulfilling his goals.|$|E

Then I went back to my place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because {{so much of}} {{the story}} is set in the winter, it was crucial to film the series where it was likely snow would be available.

Other Canadian provinces were rejected because the production crew was told it would be too cold to operate the needed equipment. Slovakia, where a 95% chance of snow was predicted, was selected for the March filming, and there was a blizzard two days before shooting began. But it quickly melted, and eventually the scenic designers had to utilize 1000 bags of artificial snow. Producer Hugh Warren recalled, [...] "We had all the expense of going to Slovakia as well as the trouble of crossing the border, and then there was no snow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> little ironic." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1881, {{the court}} martial found Flipper {{innocent}} {{of the main}} charge, but another charge was added during the trial, and he was found guilty [...] "of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman", and sentenced to be [...] "dismissed from {{the service of the}} United States". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> harsh sentence. In two prior situations involving white officers who were found guilty of embezzlement, neither officer was dismissed nor dishonored. The letters exchanged between Mollie Dwyer (Nolan's sister-in-law) and Flipper were used against Flipper. Relationships between whites and blacks were strictly forbidden in the viewpoint of the white officers on the board. Despite appeals, and denial of a lighter sentence from President Chester A. Arthur, Flipper was drummed out of the army with a dismissal, the officer equivalent of a dishonorable discharge, on June 30, 1882. For the rest of his life, Flipper contested the charges and fought to regain his commission.|$|E
2500|$|Financed by The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, Morrison {{was sent}} on an {{exploration}} journey to New Guinea.

On 24 July 1883 Morrison with a small party started {{with the intention of}} crossing to Dyke Acland Bay 100 miles (160km) away. Much high mountain country barred the way, and it took 38 days to cover 50 miles. The natives became hostile, and about a month later Morrison was struck by two spears and almost killed. Retracing their steps, with Morrison strapped to a horse, Port Moresby was reached in days.

His youngest sister, whose married name was Evelyn Hilda Gaunt (1877-1967), presented a miniature daily devotional book with an inscription [...] "Ernest with Hilda's love.
