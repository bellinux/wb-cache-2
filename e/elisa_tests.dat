5000|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an assay that {{utilizes}} {{the principle}} of antibody-antigen recognition to test {{for the presence of}} certain substances. The three main types of <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> which are indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and competitive ELISA all rely on the fact that antibodies have an affinity for only one specific antigen.

50|$|Antibody tests {{may give}} false {{negative}} (no antibodies were detected {{despite the presence}} of HIV) results during the window period, an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV seroconversion. Most people develop detectable antibodies approximately 30 days after infection, although some seroconvert later. The vast majority of people (97%) have detectable antibodies by three months after HIV infection; a six-month window is extremely rare with modern antibody testing. During the window period, an infected person can transmit HIV to others although their HIV infection may not be detectable with an antibody test. Antiretroviral therapy during the window period can delay the formation of antibodies and extend the window period beyond 12 months. This was not the case with patients that underwent treatment with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Those patients must take <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> at various intervals after the usual 28-day course of treatment, sometimes extending outside of the conservative window period of 6 months.

5000|$|The Introduction of ELISA testing (1988)In the mid-1980s, equine {{drug testing}} was for all {{practical}} purposes dependent on a screening technique called thin layer chromatography (TLC). This technology is not particularly sensitive, and in the mid-1980s some horsemen were reportedly attempting to affect the outcome of horse races by using high potency narcotics, stimulants, bronchodilators, and tranquilizers with impunity. In 1988 ELISA testing was introduced to racing by a group at the University of Kentucky. It soon became the primary technique employed in equine drug testing. ELISA is an acronym for Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. Simply put, an ELISA test is a variant on the home pregnancy test technology. It requires a drop of urine, can be performed relatively rapidly, is highly sensitive, and test results can be read by eye. Initially, the <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> were [...] "one-step" [...] tests meaning that urine was added to the test well followed by the addition of antibody for the test. This was expensive as much more antibody was wasted than reacted on the test. Later, a cheaper [...] "two-step" [...] method was devised.
