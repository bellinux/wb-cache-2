5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E

500|$|Porpoises {{are small}} {{cetaceans}} {{of the family}} Phocoenidae. They are distinct from dolphins, although the word [...] "porpoise" [...] {{has been used to}} refer to any small dolphin, especially by sailors and fishermen. The most obvious visible <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> is porpoises have spatulate (flattened) teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. In addition, porpoises are relatively r-selected compared with dolphins: that is, they rear more young more quickly than dolphins. All seven species have small flippers, notched tail flukes, and no beaks. All carry at least 11 pairs of small teeth in their upper and lower jaws.|$|E
2500|$|Bilaterians can be divided, {{based on}} events that occur {{very early in}} {{embryonic}} development, into two groups (superphyla) called protostomes and deuterostomes. [...] Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms, hemichordates (mainly acorn worms), and Xenoturbellidans. Protostomes, the more diverse group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms. [...] There is a basic <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> in {{the placement of the}} nervous system within the body: [...] protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal (usually top) side. [...] In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal-to-ventral gradients. [...] Most anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and deuterostomes are [...] "flipped over" [...] with respect to each other, a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates. [...] Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline.|$|E

50|$|The order Redlichiida {{is divided}} into two suborders: Olenellina and Redlichiina.

In other trilobites, dorsal sutures may be opisthoparian, gonatoparian, proparian or they may be lost secondarily. The absence in the fossil record of the earliest larval stage, the protaspid, suggests that the may have been uncalcified, which would be a second unique character that distinguishes the Olenellina from all other trilobites.|$|E
