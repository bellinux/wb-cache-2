5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that <b>got</b> harder the more tired you <b>got.</b> Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which <b>got</b> soft {{in the rain and}} <b>got</b> churned up by so many riders using them and then you <b>got</b> stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you <b>got</b> covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gots</b> {{was born}} in Moscow into a wealthy Jewish family. He studied at the University of Moscow and joined 'The People's Will' in 1884. In October 1886 {{he was arrested and}} banished to Siberia. In 1889 he took part in a convicts' {{uprising}} in Yakutsk and was sentenced to hard labour in Siberia for life. In 1895 an amnesty enabled <b>Gots</b> to emigrate to Paris, where he collaborated with Nikolai Rusanov and Ilya Rubanovich in editing the PSR newspaper Herald of the Russian Revolution (Vestnik Russkoi Revoliutsii). With Victor Chernov, <b>Gots</b> also edited the PSR's theoretical journal, Revolutionary Russia (Revoliutsionnaia Rossiia). <b>Gots</b> was also instrumental in establishing relations between the PSR and French and Italian socialist parties. In 1901, the Russian government demanded Gots' extradition from Italy. This led to a diplomatic crisis and to the cancellation of the Tsar's proposed visit to Italy. <b>Gots</b> died of cancer in 1906.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Ethiopia, the {{utilization}} of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLITN) is hampered by behavioural factors such as low awareness and negative attitude of the community. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the design and baseline results of a cluster randomized trial on the effect of training of household heads on the use of LLITN. Methods This baseline survey was undertaken from February to March, 2009 as part of a randomized cluster trial. A total of 11 intervention and 11 control <b>Gots</b> (villages) were included in the Gilgel Gibe Field Research Centre, south-west Ethiopia. House to house visit was done in 4135 households to collect information about the use of LLITN and socio-demographic variables. For the diagnosis of malaria and anaemia, blood samples were collected from 2410 under-five children and 242 pregnant women. Results One fourth of the households in the intervention and control <b>Gots</b> had functional LLITN. Only 30 % of the observed LLITN in the intervention and 28 % in the control <b>Gots</b> were hanged properly. Adults were more likely to utilize LLITN than under-five children in the control and intervention <b>Gots.</b> The prevalence of malaria in under-five children in the intervention and control <b>Gots</b> was 10. 5 % and 8. 3 % respectively. The intervention and control <b>Gots</b> had no significant difference concerning the prevalence of malaria in under-five children, [OR = 1. 28, (95 %CI: 0. 97, 1. 69) ]. Eight (6. 1 %) pregnant women in the intervention and eight (7. 2 %) in the control <b>Gots</b> were positive for malaria (P = 0. 9). Children in the intervention <b>Gots</b> were less likely to have anaemia than children in the control <b>Gots,</b> [OR = 0. 75, (95 %CI: 0. 62, 0. 85) ]. Conclusion The availability and utilization of LLITN was low in the study area. The prevalence of malaria and anaemia was high. Intervention strategies of malaria should focus on high risk population and vulnerable groups. </p...|$|R
