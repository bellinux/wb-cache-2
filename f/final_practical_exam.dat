40|$|BACKGROUND / AIM : Feedback on {{clinical}} reasoning skills during fieldwork education {{is regarded as}} vital in occupational therapy students’ professional development. The nature of supervisors’ feedback however, could be confirmative and/or corrective and corrective feedback could be with or without {{suggestions on how to}} improve. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the impact of supervisors’ feedback on final-year occupational therapy students’ clinical reasoning skills through comparing the nature of feedback with the students’ subsequent clinical reasoning ability. METHOD : A mixed-method approach with a convergent parallel design was used combining the collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data. From focus groups and interviews with students, data were collected and analysed qualitatively to determine how the students experienced the feedback they received from their supervisors. By quantitatively comparing the <b>final</b> <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> grades with the nature of the feedback, their fieldwork End-of-Term grades and average academic performance it became possible to merge the results for comparison and interpretation. RESULTS : Students’ clinical reasoning skills seem to be improved through corrective feedback if accompanied by suggestions on how to improve, irrespective of their average academic performance. Supervisors were inclined to underrate high performing students and overrate lower performing students. CONCLUSIONS : Students who obtained higher grades in the final practical examinations received more corrective feedback with suggestions on how to improve from their supervisors. Confirmative feedback alone may not be sufficient for improving the clinical reasoning skills of students. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Various {{factors have}} an impact on the {{development}} of the clinical reasoning skills of occupational therapy students during their training. The aim of this study was to investigate how the interpersonal communication skills of the supervisors impact on their students’ ability to learn clinical reasoning skills during their education in the physical field. Thirty final year students at the University of Pretoria and 14 supervisors from six different hospitals formed the study sample. A mixed research design was employed. Data were collected by means of focus groups and one-on-one interviews conducted with fieldwork educators and students on their inter-subjective experience of supervision. It was then analysed by a clinical psychologist using the Interpersonal Pattern Analysis diagnostic instrument, and finally compared with the grades students obtained for their clinical reasoning skills in the <b>final</b> <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> in the physical field. The findings of this study indicated that the supervisors of students who received good grades, were predominantly linear in their approach, showed limited empathy and confirmation, were rigid in their expectations and solved problems effectively. Supervisors of students who received lower grades were mainly circular in their approach, were flexible and partly empathetic, validated students and also solved problems effectively. Regarding the interpersonal approach to human behaviour there is no one role or pattern of interaction that is more effective in all contexts. A style or a pattern that may be highly effective in one kind of relationship may be ineffective in another. What is emerging here is that a style which is characterised by flexibility and empathy is not necessarily an effective teaching style, whereas one characterised by a linear approach, rigidity and limited empathy may prove to be significantly more effective. This paper is based on the research at the University of Pretoria for the PhD in Occupational Therapy. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ultrasonography {{protocols}} {{are easy}} to learn, frequently used in emergency medicine, and could be useful for inexperienced doctors. In this field, only a few protocols are needed to give an initial diagnosis and to start fast and proper treatment. Until now, only Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) protocol training studies {{have been reported in}} the medical literature. Our point-of-care course, comprised of extended FAST, lung scan and ocular scan trainings. The students’ curriculum usually does not include such ultrasonography courses, thus, we wanted to check its utility for the undergraduate medical students. Methods: Training lasted six days and consisted of two parts: 22 hours of theoretical classes and 18 hours of practical activities, all trained and evaluated by six experienced medical doctors. Eighty-five elected students completed pre- and post-study questionnaires about emergency ultrasonography and passed the <b>practical</b> <b>final</b> <b>exam.</b> Results: Eighty-five participants of the course were present in the pre- and final test.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In a {{previous}} study, we discovered students {{would not be}} opposed to a PowerPoint practical using photos of lab specimen (HPERS 2008). The midterm <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> utilized PowerPoint. However, the <b>final</b> <b>practical</b> was a traditional exam using tagged specimen. PURPOSE: To evaluate student perceptions of different <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> formats. METHODOLOGY: Optometry (N= 104), Physical (N= 43) and Occupational (N= 29) Therapy students were given a multiple choice survey. RESULTS: Almost {{all of the students}} found the <b>practical</b> <b>exams</b> enjoyable (45 %) or helpful (50 %). Many students felt this traditional practical was much better than (46 %) traditional <b>practical</b> <b>exams</b> they had taken previously. Most students indicated they would request this method in the future (81 %). Almost the entire class said specimens were clear (94 %). However, only 67 % of the students preferred the traditional tagged practical over the PowerPoint method. Almost unanimously (92 %), the class preferred this multiple choice <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> over the typical fill-in-the blank lab <b>practical</b> <b>exams.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although students were very pleased with the PowerPoint practical, they preferred the traditional exam. However student perceptions of this exam may be affected by the use of a multiple choice format. Regardless, it is clear the combination of multiple choice and tagged neuro-anatomical structures is the preferred testing method. It allows for word recognition without anxiety over spelling, while validating time spent studying in lab...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{outcomes}} for students whose education {{takes place in}} the physical field are, among others, knowledge and skills to implement the occupational therapy process. In this process patients’ problems are assessed and recorded, treatment planned, implemented, continuously evaluated, and the progress of each such patient professionally recorded. Since this is a process which requires distinct clinical reasoning skills {{on the part of the}} student various factors can influence the development of such skills during their training. Many authors are of the opinion that it is the interpersonal communication between supervisor and student which underpins successful fieldwork education. In this study the purpose therefore was to investigate how the interpersonal communication factors in the supervisory relationship play a role in enhancing occupational therapy students’ clinical reasoning during physical fieldwork education. At the outset a partially mixed, sequential dominant, status-qualitative design was employed. An inter-subjective or interactional epistemological position was adopted in order to generate data from the participants’ subjective experiences, and an interpretive approach was used to understand how occupational therapy students and supervisors perceive the supervisory relationship during the formers’ learning of their clinical reasoning skills. Data was generated from four sources. First of all, from focus groups conducted separately with students and their supervisors on completion of the fieldwork block; secondly from semi-structured one-on-one interviews held with students as well as supervisors on completion of the formers’ fieldwork block; thirdly from students’ Work Habits Reports, and finally by recording the practical exam grades students obtained in the physical field. To analyse the data both qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed. Information obtained from the focus groups and one-on-one interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. After this process, transcribed data was coded and analysed following both a bottom-up and top down approach. The former was carried out by an independent coder and the latter by the researcher herself to determine which interpersonal communication themes and patterns might emerge from the collected data. A clinical psychologist using the Interpersonal Pattern Analysis, a diagnostic instrument, analysed the audio tapes of 14 supervisors who participated in the focus groups and one-on-one interviews. The themes which emerged from the thematic-content analysis and the Interpersonal Pattern Analysis were compared with the grades students obtained for their clinical reasoning skills in the <b>final</b> <b>practical</b> <b>exam</b> in the physical field. The findings of this study indicated that supervisors of students who received high grades solved problems effectively, were predominately linear in their approach, showed only limited empathy, were rigid in their expectations and gave only limited confirmation. In line with these findings supervisors of students who received lower grades were also effective in terms of problem solving skills and also gave limited confirmation, but were circular in their approach, showed partial empathy and were flexible. Finally in respect of the interpersonal approach to human behaviour there is no one role or pattern of interaction that is more effective in all contexts. A style or a pattern that may be highly effective in one kind of relationship may be ineffective in another. What is emerging here though is that a style which is characterised by flexibility and empathy may not necessarily be an effective teaching style, whereas a style characterised by a linear approach and limited empathy did indeed prove to be significantly more effective.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} students' {{academic success}} at {{delivered in a}} traditional continual course, spread over the two semesters, or in alternating course blocks. [...] - METHOD: We analyzed the data on exam grades for Anatomy and Chemistry courses {{in the first year}} of the curriculum for academic year 2001 / 02, with the traditional continual delivery of the courses (n= 253 for chemistry and n= 243 for anatomy), and academic year 2003 / 04, with block delivery of the courses (n= 255 for Chemistry and n= 260 for Anatomy). Grades from the final examination were analyzed only for students who sat the exam at the first available exam term and passed the course. For the Anatomy block course, grades at 2 interim written tests and 2 parts of the <b>final</b> <b>exam</b> (<b>practical</b> stage <b>exam</b> and oral exam) in each block were analyzed for students who passed all interim tests and the final exam. [...] - RESULTS: There were no differences between two types of course delivery in the number of students passing the final examination at first attempt. There was a decrease in passing percentage for the two Anatomy block course student groups in 2003 / 04 (56 % passing students in block 1 vs 40 % in block 2, P= 0. 014). There was an increase in the average grades from 2001 / 02 to 2003 / 04 academic year due to an increase in Chemistry grades (F 1, 399 = 18. 4, P< 0. 001, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was no effect of the sequence of their delivery (F 1, 206 = 1. 8, P= 0. 182, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was also a significant difference in grades on interim assessments of Anatomy when it was delivered in the block format (F 3, 85 = 28. 8, P< 0. 001, between-within subjects 2 x 4 ANOVA). [...] - CONCLUSIONS: The type of course delivery was not associated with significant differences in student academic success in Anatomy and Chemistry courses in the medical curriculum. Students can successfully pass these courses when they are delivered either in a continual, whole year format or in a condensed time format of a course block, regardless of the number and type of courses preceding the block course...|$|R

Their use in physiotherapy education, however, has not been fully investigated. The aim of this project was to determine the effectiveness of a video-based learning activity for improving student confidence, satisfaction, and performance in <b>practical</b> <b>exams.</b> Methods: Focus groups and surveys were used to explore student perceptions (n= 62) of <b>practical</b> <b>exams,</b> including preparatory methods, understanding of marking criteria, and associated anxiety. Feedback was used to construct a series of videos of physiotherapy assessment and an activity was designed whereby students viewed the videos and graded performance against the same rubric used to assess their <b>practical</b> <b>exam.</b> Videos were then made available on the course website. Student satisfaction was determined using surveys, focus groups, and standard course evaluations. Student grades were compared with those of the previous year cohort. Results: Students were not confident about their <b>practical</b> <b>exams</b> and were uncertain of what to expect, suggesting they needed examples to aid their preparation. Students were very supportive of the new activity with 96. 4 % responding positively when asked of its effectiveness. Students attested that the activity improved their confidence with the exam (94. 5 %) and felt that the activity should be used in future courses (98. 1 %). Student grades were greater (81. 6 ± 8. 7 vs 78. 1 ± 9. 0, p= 0. 01) in the current cohort (n= 62) when compared with the previous one (n= 50).
