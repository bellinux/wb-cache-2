25|$|The {{proposed}} harbours {{called for}} many huge caissons of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures {{to provide the}} roadways. The caissons were built {{at a number of}} locations, mainly <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including Balfour Beatty, Henry Boot, Bovis & Co, Cochrane & Sons, Costain, Cubitts, French, Holloway Brothers, John Laing & Son, Peter Lind & Company, Sir Robert McAlpine, Melville Dundas & Whitson, Mowlem, Nuttall, Parkinson, Pauling & Co. and Taylor Woodrow. On completion they were towed across the English Channel by tugs to the Normandy coast at only 4.3 Knots (8km/h or 5mph), assembled, operated and maintained by the Corps of Royal Engineers, under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts.|$|E
500|$|Dreadnought was {{originally}} named Fury and {{was designed by}} the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Edward Reed, as an improved and enlarged version of the preceding [...] turret ships. The ship was laid down, fully framed and partially plated up {{to the bottom of}} the waterline belt armour when work was ordered stopped in 1871 in light of the loss of the ironclad turret ship [...] in a heavy storm the previous year. A Committee on Designs was formed in January 1871 to evaluate <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> designs with special consideration as to their stability and buoyancy and found that the designs of Devastation and Fury were lacking in both qualities and needed to be modified.

500|$|Paramount made a {{decision}} early on to use <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> models for filming, meaning the old models—some {{more than a decade}} old—had to be refurbished, adapted, and reused. As some ships had not been examined for some time, electrical problems had developed. The Klingon cruiser first seen in 1979's The Motion Picture was altered to suggest an important flagship, with a flared design applied to the underside of the vessel. Effects supervisor William George wanted to make it distinct from the earlier ships, since {{it was one of the}} few models that could be altered: [...] "We did some research into military costuming, and came up with the concept that when these ships return victorious from battle, the Klingons build some sort of epaulet onto their wings or paint a new stripe on." [...] The model was repainted brown and red and etched with brass.|$|E

500|$|The {{oil boom}} helped {{expansion}} of several Texas ports including four ports currently ranked {{as the top}} twenty busiest ports in the United States in terms of cargo tonnage. [...] The Houston Ship Channel and Port of Houston became the state's busiest shipping resources. [...] , the Port of Houston ranks second in the United States in terms of cargo tonnage (and first in foreign trade). [...] Although Houston took the lead, the oil boom benefited other areas. [...] The Sabine–Neches Waterway, located in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, saw growth {{as a result of}} the oil boom. [...] The <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> channel was deepened following the 1901 Spindletop discovery and has been deepened several times since then. [...] That waterway serves two of the United States's ports ranked in the top twenty in terms of cargo tonnage. The Port of Beaumont is ranked 4th and the Port of Port Arthur is ranked 18th. [...] As of December 2013, The Sabine–Neches Waterway is the third-busiest waterway in the United States in terms of tons of cargo behind the Port of South Louisiana and the Houston Ship Channel. [...] The Sabine–Neches Waterway is also the top bulk crude oil importer, the top bulk liquid waterway, and is projected to become the largest LNG exporter in the United States. [...] Discovery of oil also helped the eighth (8th) ranked Port of Corpus Christi. [...] Oil discoveries in nearby counties in the early 1930s resulted in the construction of refineries near the port. [...] The principle cargo shifted from cotton to petroleum products. [...] The Port of Texas City was another port which benefited from the oil boom. [...] That port is currently ranked 14th in terms of cargo tonnage.|$|E
500|$|RKO {{had scored}} a major {{financial}} success with Cat People (1942). The film, which cost $141,659, brought in almost $4 {{million in its}} first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel {{to build on the}} success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story [...] "The Amorous Ghost" [...] instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. [...] "He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain." [...] One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991, {{researchers}} Dana M. Wegner and Colan Ratliff {{from the}} David Taylor Research Center and Kevin Lynaugh, from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, published an exhaustive {{report on the}} question. Their research noted several key pieces of historical evidence that the two ships were not the same vessel. This included {{the fact that the}} timbers from the dismantled 1797 Constellation were auctioned off after the ship-breaking process ended in September 1853, the fact that the keel-laying for the 1854 ship had been done in June 1853, before the 1797 ship had been dismantled completely, and building records that meticulously accounted for each piece of timber that was used to build the new ship; in fact, only 204 oak knees were re-used, but these came from existing stocks, not the original vessel and they stated that, [...] "There was no evidence that any material was transferred directly from the old ship to the new." [...] In March 1989, they had come upon the builder's half-hull model of Constellation in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. This was important because half-hull models are only built for new designs, not rebuilds, and the use of half-hull models was not introduced until after 1797. The authors conclude that this is definitive evidence that the vessel launched in 1854 was new, as it was [...] "impossible to accurately scale down the form of an <b>existing</b> <b>ship</b> to model format," [...] and that [...] "a new half model would not have been employed by Lenthall unless he was forging a fully new design." ...|$|E

50|$|Gas {{carriers}} {{built before}} 1977 (the <b>Existing</b> <b>Ship</b> Code)The regulations covering gas carriers built before 1977 {{are contained in}} the Code for Existing Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. Its content {{is similar to the}} GC Code, though less extensive.The <b>Existing</b> <b>Ship</b> Code was completed in 1976 after the GC Code had been written. It therefore summarises current shipbuilding practice at that time. It remains as an IMO recommendation for all gas carriers in this older fleet of ships. The Code is not mandatory but is applied by some countries for ship registration and in other countries as a necessary fulfilment prior to port entry. Accordingly, many ships of this age are required by charterers to meet with Code standards and to have on board a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the century}} {{came to a}} close, the {{familiar}} modern battleship began to emerge; a steel-armored ship, entirely dependent on steam, and sporting a number of large shell guns mounted in turrets arranged along the centerline of the main deck.

During this period, a rebuild could amount to anything from stripping off planking to facilitate replacement of rotten timbers and adjustments to suit the required dimensions, or complete dismantlement and construction of what was, for all intents and purposes, a completely new ship making but the scantiest use of timber from the old ship.|$|R
