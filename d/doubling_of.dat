Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
