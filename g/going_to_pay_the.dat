25|$|Early in 1879, some Gundagai {{residents}} were in {{fear that the}} Ned Kelly gang was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> town a visit and while Extra rifles and ammunition to defend the town.. were applied for and special constables were sworn in, the Kelly Gang did turn up in the town.|$|E
25|$|Clarkson {{was born}} in Doncaster, the son of Shirley Gabrielle Clarkson, a teacher, and Edward Grenville Clarkson, a {{travelling}} salesman. His parents, who ran a business selling tea cosies, put their son's name down in advance for private schools, with no idea how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> fees, until at the last moment, when he was 13, they made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys for each of their children. These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business with sufficient success {{to be able to}} pay the fees for Clarkson to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876, Egypt went bankrupt. A {{group of}} European {{financial}} commissioners led by Evelyn Baring {{took charge of}} the Egyptian finances in an attempt to pay off the European banks who had lent so much money to Egypt. With Egypt bankrupt, the money to carry out the reforms Gordon wanted was not there. With over half of Egypt's income <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> 7% interest on the debt worth 81 million Egyptian pounds that Isma'il had run up, the khedive was supportive of Gordon's plans for reform, but unable to do very much as he lacked the money to pay his civil servants and soldiers in Egypt, much less in the Sudan.|$|E
50|$|In Malta Fellows {{received}} a few pleasant surprises. <b>The</b> museum was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> expedition. Fellows {{was invited to}} stay on at the museum. The marbles {{became known as the}} Xanthian marbles.|$|R
6000|$|... “I met {{a gentleman}} {{who was at}} Mr. Raymond’s yesterday, and he has hired us to perform at his house this evening from eight o’clock to nine. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> us <b>the</b> same amount, twelve dollars.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] he said, [...] "to {{prove to}} you that I am in earnest. I am {{therefore}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>the</b> amount I promised, although I am perfectly well aware {{that the story of}} Madame is--false!" ...|$|R
2500|$|His revelations {{cost him}} both his {{coaching}} {{role at the}} University of Saskatchewan and his Canadian shot put record. Among his statements, {{he also said that}} he looked upon his past steroid use with regret, noting that he had suffered mentally and physically as a direct result. While still working as a coach, he had used these experiences in order to warn the next generation of athletes of the dangers of drug use: [...] "I give people the examples of individuals that I have known that have gotten sick from the use of steroids and I try to come across and give the kids the message, 'Look, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price at some point in time.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{when two}} University of South Florida {{students}} were arrested on explosives charges in South Carolina, Bedier {{was at the}} forefront of calling for a fair trial and due process. Bedier knew one of the students, Youssef Megahed, casually. For some of his critics, this is proof that he is a terrorist in sheep’s clothing. When the facts are reviewed, they reveal that Bedier had no connections with the man who was convicted, and the man he knew casually was found innocent on all charges. In an interview with the Tampa Tribune, Bedier stated that the video produced by Ahmed Mohamed showing how to make a remote detonator was unacceptable. Mohamed [...] "was sent here on a scholarship to do a doctorate in engineering and not to make videos, and now he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> {{price for}} the thing you did at the little {{bungalow}} in the Waziri country," [...] replied the ape-man.|$|E
50|$|Running fan-funded campaigns cost bands {{a large sum}} of money. They {{must pay}} for video {{production}} for the video that every campaign has, a producer and an engineer to mix and master their album, and fulfill all of the rewards promised to their fans {{as well as the}} shipping on them. Often the money made off these projects ends up <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> costs of running a successful fan funded campaign. For example, {{a large portion of the}} $1 million that Amanda Palmer raised went into funding her Kickstarter project itself. Artists such as Palmer have huge fan bases to appeal to for money, but for the average artist raising that kind of money isn't a reliable method.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{came across}} the fellow we got the pumps from this afternoon,” Jimmy remarked. “The last time I saw him he was fairly civil, but he’s turned abusive now. Wanted to know when we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him <b>the</b> rest of his money, and made some pointed {{observations}} about our character.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... 4 Jul: The RHD claimed {{responsibility}} for shooting dead a Catholic civilian {{as he waited for}} a lift to work in Antrim. The attack was a drive-by shooting by gunmen on a motorbike. In a call to a newspaper, a RHD spokesman said the teenager had been shot in [...] "direct response to the Catholic people of Antrim voting in two Sinn Féin councillors. They are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price for it. God Save Ulster".|$|R
6000|$|... "I am only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> {{one that}} I engaged," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but, poor thing, I mean {{to give her}} two coppers, instead of one, she looks so sick and miserable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse!" [...] {{her husband}} {{answered}} gloomily. [...] "We've been living on our capital for years. Every acre of Queen's Norton is mortgaged, and I'm shot if I {{can see how}} we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> interest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of making silly {{conditions}} like that!" [...] the man grumbled. [...] "If I knew where they were, I'd earn the quid soon enough, but I don't, and that's the long and the short of it! And if you ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> eighteen and six, well, I've answered all the questions I feel inclined to." ...|$|E
50|$|In addition, Laker Airways {{agreed with}} Japanese lessor Mitsui that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> buy the {{aircraft}} from McDonnell-Douglas before leasing them <b>to</b> Laker <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> leases out of flying revenues only. This meant the airline was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> aircraft {{if they were}} not revenue-earning. It proved to be effective to minimise the financial risk an investment on this scale posed.|$|R
5000|$|... "Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> city's day {{of purple}} spray?" [...] asked Don Holliday of the Cape Argus. [...] "As the {{controversy}} continues over who is <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> clean-up of buildings, streets, cars and clothing sprayed purple by police during Saturday's Mass Democratic Movement's attempted march to parliament, police {{announced that they}} would release details {{of the effects of}} the dye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sixteen {{is awful}} old, isn't it?" [...] said Jimmy reflectively. [...] "I'll {{tell you what}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do when I'm sixteen, Theodora. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off <b>the</b> mortgage, and buy mother a silk dress, and a piano for the twins. Won't that be elegant? I'll {{be able to do}} that 'cause I'm a man. Of course if I was only a girl I couldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> rent? And {{the taxes}} are falling due. It's {{all very well}} {{for you to say}} they must go away. If they go away I can't pay the bills." [...] She turned to Philip, with tears {{streaming}} down her face. [...] "Ach, Herr Carey, you will not say what you have heard. If Fraulein Forster--" [...] this was the Dutch spinster--"if Fraulein Forster knew she would leave at once. And if they all go we must close the house. I cannot afford to keep it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead! I {{thought it}} 'ud be that! Dear, dear! poor Margy, so strong {{as she was}} only last Saturday, and dead! Poor Margy, poor dear--we was always friendly"--here she wiped away a tear--"as good a soul as ever breathed! That she was, though she did die like that; but she never had a chance, {{and went to the}} bad all on account of him. Dead, and he on the drink--Lord only knows where he gits it--and lying there asleep in his room, and his poor wife dead at the hospital, and never {{thinking}} how he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> rent. I've stood it long enough for poor Margy, poor dear, because we was friends like, and she'd her troubles the same as me, but I ain't going to stand it from him. That I'll let him know fast enough; and now she's dead he can take himself off, and good riddance. But how're you going to live--begging about the street? A big girl like you--I'm ashamed of such goings on, and ain't going to have it in my house." ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo and James {{were both}} sorry {{they had not}} thought of it themselves; and, as soon as Jonas {{mentioned}} it, they wanted to give some of their money to the girl; but Jonas said he knew that Georgie would prefer to do it. At last, however, {{it was agreed that}} Rollo and James should furnish one cent each, and Georgie the rest. This was all agreed upon after a low conversation by themselves {{in a corner of the}} store; and then Jonas came forward, and told the shopman that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> additional five cents, and that he might let the girl have the slate. So Jonas paid the money, and it was agreed that Rollo and James should pay him back their share, when they got their money changed. The boys were very much pleased to see the little girl go away so happy with her slate in her hand. It was neatly done up in paper, with two pencils which the shopman gave her, done up inside.|$|E
50|$|The budget {{contained}} few surprises: {{most major}} initiatives had been announced long beforehand. These included $2 billion for health care, money for municipalities, and $1 billion to help livestock farmers harmed by the Mad Cow crisis. Government spending {{was set to}} increase {{at the same rate}} as Gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years with any surplus <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> down <b>the</b> national debt.|$|R
5000|$|At the trial, Charlie Moses (Janet's {{paternal}} grandfather) took {{a stance}} supporting the defendants: [...] "We've made our peace with them. They didn't {{know what they}} were doing, even though I told them not to go down that road. They chose to do it anyway. For that mistake ... they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> rest of their lives. I wish them well all the same." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} all the missed {{opportunities}} against Levante in La Liga and Auxerre in the Champions League, Mourinho said, [...] "One day some poor rival is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>the</b> chances we've missed today." [...] The following match at the Bernabéu ended with a 6–1 victory over Deportivo de La Coruña. The following league games confirmed Mourinho's statement, defeating Málaga by 1–4 and Racing de Santander again by 6–1.|$|R
6000|$|None but Englishmen or Englishwomen do {{such things}} as this. To other people is wanting {{sufficient}} pluck for such enterprises; is wanting also a certain mixture of fun, honest independence, and bad taste. Let us go into some church on the Continent--in Italy, we will say--where {{the walls of the}} churches still boast of the great works of the great masters.--Look at that man standing on the very altar-step while the priest is saying his mass; look at his gray shooting-coat, his thick shoes, his wide-awake hat stuck under one arm, and his stick under the other, while he holds his opera-glass to his eyes. How he shuffles about to get the best point of sight, quite indifferent as to clergy or laity! All that bell-ringing, incense-flinging, and breast-striking is nothing to him: he has paid dearly to be brought thither; he has paid the guide who is kneeling a little behind him; he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> sacristan who attends him; he is quite ready to pay the priest himself, if the priest would only signify his wish that way; but he has come there to see that fresco, and see it he will: respecting that he will soon know more than either the priest or his worshippers. Perhaps some servant of the church, coming to him with submissive, almost suppliant gesture, begs him to step back just for one moment. The lover of art glares at him with insulted look, and hardly deigns to notice him further: he merely turns his eye to his Murray, puts his hat down on the altar-step, and goes on studying his subject. All the world--German, Frenchman, Italian, Spaniard--all men of all nations know that that ugly gray shooting-coat must contain an Englishman. He cares for no one. If any one upsets him, he can do much towards righting himself; and if more be wanted, has he not Lord Malmesbury or Lord Clarendon at his back? But what would this Englishman say if his place of worship were disturbed by some wandering Italian? ...|$|E
6000|$|As Nero {{traveled}} very fast, {{they began}} {{by this time}} to draw near {{to the place where}} they had left the sailor. When they came up to the house, they fastened the horse to a post, and went in. The man who lived there had gone away, but the woman said that the sailor was somewhat hurt, and asked them to come in and see him. They found him in the kitchen, with his foot up in a chair. He seemed to be in some pain. There was a great bruise on his ankle, made by the cork of one of the horses' shoes. These corks, as they are called, are projections, made of steel, at the heel of a horse-shoe, to give the horse a firm footing. They are made quite sharp in the winter season, when there is ice and snow upon the ground, but they are generally more blunt in the summer. This prevented the ankle's being cut as badly as it would have been, if the corks had been sharper. Forester looked at the ankle, and found that nothing had been done for it. It was inflamed and painful. He got the woman to give him a basin of warm water, and then he bathed it very carefully, which relieved the sense of tension and pain. Then he made an ointment of equal parts of tallow and oil, which he put upon the end of a bandage, and thus bound it up. This treatment relieved the poor sailor very much. Then Forester proposed to the sailor to get into the wagon and go with him to the next house, and the sailor consented. Forester was then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> woman for his night's lodging, but the sailor said at once,--"No, squire, not at all. I'm much obliged to you for doing up my foot, but you need not pay any thing for me. I've got plenty of shot in the locker." ...|$|E
50|$|If the Conservative {{movement}} {{chooses to}} do something {{at the expense of}} the halachic system, then it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price down the road... The erosion of our fidelity to Halacha is what brings us close to Reform Judaism.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right here, in {{this great}} city. Mr. Bartol is to take me into his office. He's like a father to me already; but I don't expect him to give me anything. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you back <b>the</b> money you have lost." ...|$|R
50|$|Tommy Stewart {{enrolled}} at Alabama State College without knowing {{how he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tuition. <b>The</b> problem solved itself {{when he joined the}} Bama State Collegians, a dance band formed in 1929 who at various times featured Erskine Hawkins, Avery Parrish, Joe Newman, Sam Taylor, Julian Dash, Benny Powell, and Vernall Fournier. Other musicians who attended Alabama State are Clarence Carter, Fred Wesley (James Brown), and Walter Orange (Commodores). The popular band made enough money to fund Stewart's way through four years of college.|$|R

50|$|The Eastern League was to {{be governed}} by annual {{meetings}} to be held each year in Philadelphia on the second Wednesday of January. Annual dues were $100 per club, with $500 of this amount <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> salary of the league's permanent Secretary.|$|E

60|$|Ellen {{looked up}} wistfully, hoping Mrs. Page was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> her for <b>the</b> last work.

50|$|In 1999, Upper Deck Company {{spent in}} excess of $1.1 million in {{acquiring}} vintage baseball memorabilia items at the Barry Halper Collection auction held at Sotheby's in New York City. One of the items was a Ty Cobb jersey that Upper Deck paid $332,500 for. As part of a sweepstakes prize, it gave the jersey to 14-year-old Robert Shell of Milwaukee. At the time, the estimated tax Robert was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> on <b>the</b> prize was $125,000. The amount, his mother said, would force the family to sell the jersey.|$|R
