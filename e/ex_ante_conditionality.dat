40|$|Award date: 28 November 2014 Supervisor: Professor Claire Kilpatrick, European University InstituteThe thesis {{engages in}} a {{comprehensive}} legal study of the fundamental rights conditionalities as introduced in the 2014 - 2020 European Structural and Investment Funds normative framework. It focuses on three general <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>conditionalities</b> {{in the area of}} antidiscrimination, gender equality and disability. Conditionality in fundamental rights is a long-standing EU policy tool, used mainly to enforce compliance with fundamental rights values on third countries. The 2013 Cohesion policy reform marks a strong transition of fundamental rights conditionality to internal policy. The development stirred a great interest as the tool addresses directly the EU Member States. It conditions the access to funding on a prior fulfilment of specifically prescribed fundamental rights criteria. In this context, the thesis inquires what is the nature and reach of the novel fundamental rights conditionalities. To facilitate a robust understanding of the newly introduced tool, the thesis firstly undertakes a conceptual analysis of conditionality. It further takes an evolutivecomparative approach, locating the fundamental rights conditionalities in the broader context of EU conditionality policy {{as well as in the}} context of European Structural and Investment Funds framework. Tested against the two areas, the research finds that the analysed <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>conditionalities</b> endorse the novelty claim, but, at the same time, they present similarities with the EU general use of conditionality in fundamental rights. Equally, fundamental rights conditionalities build harmoniously on the prior arrangements of European Structural and Investment Funds. The thesis concludes with a general assessment of the novel fundamental rights conditionalities’ potential and limits, primarily with regards to Cohesion policy and secondly with regards to the overall EU goal of promoting equality and combating status discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> {{real rate}} of {{interest}} {{is one of the}} most important concepts in economics and finance. Because the universally-used Fisher theory of interest requires positive <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> real interest rates, empirical estimates of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> real interest rate derived from the Fisher theory of interest should also be positive.

40|$|Traditional {{conditionality}} in policy-based lending {{is often}} criticized as being ineffective, intrusive, and corrosive. Disillusionment {{has led to}} proposals to replace <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> with ex post conditionality and to focus on ownership, selectivity, and partnerships. This paper reviews experiences with conditionality in the World Bank’s policy-based lending and explores the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches. It argues that conditionality should {{play a central role}} in policy-based lending—but cannot substitute for country ownership and good policies. Moreover, an exclusive focus on conditionality based on ex ante commitments or ex post results may not be practical or useful for the Bank’s policy-based lending. Thus a key recommendation is to use conditionality selectively, tailored to country circumstances. Indeed, an eclectic mix of traditional and new approaches is already being used—with programmatic policy-based lending offering a particularly promising way to reconcile the debate between the traditional ex ante approach and the aspirations of a results-based approach to conditionality...|$|E

40|$|With {{regions and}} nations having {{formally}} fulfilled the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>conditionality,</b> this book provides a first overall review of RIS 3 policy processes, aiming {{to assess the}} consistency of the concept of smart specialization from an applied, policy-oriented perspective. Moving from the theory of design to the practice of implementation, the reflections and case studies in this volume reveal strengths and weaknesses in the way concrete strategies have been conceived and implemented, enabling reflections {{on the future of the}} concept in a more general sense. In many cases, smart specialization strategies turn out to be new variants of regional development policies, embracing the importance of a place-based approach. However, the approach's potential to add distinctive value will stem from its capacity to turn innovation and knowledge into tools for local development by harnessing them for wider territorial development goals. By helping regions to identify and leverage untapped resources through new processes, smart specialization-based policies may help to reconcile cohesion and competitiveness objective. Consequently, new approaches appear most promising where institutional, administrative and political conditions allow the setup of genuinely new processes and where their focus is on territorial assets in a comprehensive manner rather than mere industrial renewal...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} {{is to examine the}} way in which the EU has {{differentiated}} its relations with its Eastern and Southern neighbours, as well as the basis for such differentiation. The analysis shows that differentiation lies at the heart of the EU relations with these countries, and also describes factors that have led to ‘differentiation’ in the context of the ENP. The deepening of the cooperation with the ENP countries is not always and only due to political conditionality; it is linked to ex post rather than <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>conditionality.</b> The high level of variable geometry in the ENP does not, however, concern EU restrictive measures. The EU has adopted a fairly uniform policy in this area and has imposed restrictive measures vis-à-vis neighbour countries, regardless of their different geopolitical position and specific relations with the EU. In the near future, the level of variable geometry in the ENP is likely to grow: new contractual arrangements will be offered to Armenia and Azerbaijan; and differentiation and flexibility are the hallmarks of the 2015 review of the ENP. The question arises: Can the ENP remain a single policy framework, considering the high degree of differentiation? It is submitted herein that the ENP should remain the overall framework for the EU-ENP relations, since this counters the risk of a re-nationalization of this policy. A different issue is whether the EU’s choice of engaging with countries which have rejected EU values, in whole or in part, can be reconciled with a value-based foreign policy...|$|E
