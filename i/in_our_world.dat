He now works for Kevin as part of Hare-Link and is married to George's former wife Martha. Another is Daisy, a daisy plant made intelligent by the GBC. It lives with the Dewclaws as a pet, having the same intelligence as a dog or cat <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E

5000|$|Constructed {{languages}} play {{an important}} role in Ill Bethisad, and it can be said that Ill Bethisad is the central meeting point, if not the cradle, of an entire subgenre of conlangs, namely alternative languages. To date there are over thirty languages at varying levels of construction that play part. Among the languages spoken in Ill Bethisad are Brithenig (a Romance language with strong Celtic substrate influences, based on Welsh), Wenedyk (Polish as a Romance language), Bohemian (Pémišna: Germanized Czech), Dalmatian (a romance language similar to Romanian, based on the actual extinct language of the same name), Xliponian (another Romance language with a superficial resemblance to Albanian, spoken <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world's</b> Epirus) and several Finnish-like [...] "North Slavic" [...] languages, including Nassian (spoken <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world's</b> Karelia).|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} year of Narnia, the Creation of Narnia was {{witnessed}} by six creatures: Jadis, Empress of Charn, Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Andrew Ketterley, Frank the cabman, and his cab horse Strawberry. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer Jadis from London <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> back to her own world of Charn, the group arrived in the unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.|$|E

25|$|The Empire of Brazil seizes {{control of}} Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Guyanas in the 1870s, the same decade which sees the United Kingdom uniting Australia and New Zealand as the Dominion of Australasia. In addition, the Republic of Gran Colombia never breaks {{up into the}} nations of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b> This exemplifies the trend in the series of fewer and fewer nations {{achieving}} sovereign independent status.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the animals}} found <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> {{can also be found}} in Narnia. In addition, there are talking {{versions}} of most of these animals. When Aslan breathed upon the first animal pairs, some not only gained thought and speech, but changed in size as well. Smaller animals (rodents, birds and small mammals) are larger than their non-talking relatives and larger animals are slightly smaller. Talking beasts can be divided into three main categories: Avian, Mammal, and Reptile. There are no talking fish or insects.|$|E
25|$|Thelma learns from Peggy, {{the ghost}} of a woman who died in the 1918 {{influenza}} pandemic, that the gestation of Azazeal's child is weakening the veil between worlds, allowing more ghosts to appear to the living. If the child is born, the veil will be torn, allowing the rest of the Nephilim to enter our world. If the pregnancy is terminated, the veil will heal, preventing the Nephilim from returning and leaving Azazeal the only one of his kind <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b> But there is a side effect: ghosts will also vanish from this world.|$|E

25|$|Also, the time-symmetric {{interpretation}} of the electromagnetic waves {{appears to be in}} contrast with the experimental evidence that time flows in a given direction and, thus, that the T-symmetry is broken <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b> It is commonly believed, however, that this symmetry breaking appears only in the thermodynamical limit (see, for example, the arrow of time). Wheeler himself accepted that {{the expansion of the universe}} is not time-symmetric in the thermodynamic limit. This, however, does not imply that the T-symmetry must be broken also at the microscopic level.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>world,</b> 1966, Isaac Heller (the Author) {{is working}} at a {{television}} shop as a struggling writer trying to sell color tvs, until he gets a letter from Star Publishing saying that he is wanted for hire. He arrives to find a mostly empty room, with the Apprentice at the desk, who then lays out a selection of different writing materials and demands that Isaac choose one as a test. Isaac picks the magic quill, which seems to approve of him in turn. The Apprentice creates a magic door to another realm, and both he and the Author go through it.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} {{plot device}} in The Chronicles is {{the interaction between}} the various worlds that make up the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis's contemporary Tolkien's Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the world of Narnia is flat and geocentric and has different stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of time does not correspond directly to the passage of time <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

50|$|France and the British Isles are {{combined}} into a single state as the Anglo-French Empire, whilst Russia, Italy, and Germany continue as loose collections of small states. Society is stratified - most important government positions are held by nobles, who dispense justice and still maintain private soldiers. The Church is powerful and a central component of everyone's life (there {{had never been a}} Reformation, or it took a very different form, as some of the worst abuses of the late-Medieval/Renaissance Catholic Church seem to have been eliminated or minimized). However, serfdom is as dead as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>world,</b> and the rights of the common people appear to be as well protected as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world's</b> Western democracies, if in different ways.|$|R

25|$|From {{the time}} of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby {{daughter}} as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world.</b> And {{to the accompaniment of}} live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English.|$|E
25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E
