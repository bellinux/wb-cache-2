50|$|The display {{consists}} of an LED display apparatus including multiple LED <b>display</b> <b>modules,</b> an inner frame member, and a supporting unit. The LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> has an array of light emitting diodes mounted thereon, and a longitudinal axis. The inner frame member is disposed to confine the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> therein, and has a size sufficient to permit movement of the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> in opposite directions of the longitudinal axis. The supporting unit mounts the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> in the inner frame member such that the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> is movable {{back and forth in}} the inner frame member along the longitudinal axis. As the drum spins, the system controls the lighting of each pixel at a precise location to produce a visible image.|$|R

The {{size of the}} vibrotactile <b>display</b> <b>module</b> is 5 mm× 5 mm× 5 mm, which is smaller than any vibrator motors. The method of making a user feel tactile sensation with the vibrotactile <b>display</b> <b>module</b> is by small pin stimulation to bare skin of a human, which {{is different from that}} with vibrator motors. The power consumption is about 0. 3 ~ 0. 4 W per one module, which {{is similar to that of}} a vibrator motor.

40|$|Abstract The {{failure of}} <b>display</b> <b>modules</b> in {{cellular}} phones due to drop impact {{depends on the}} materials, stiffnesses and shapes of the phones. In the early development stage of cellular phones, {{the behavior of the}} <b>display</b> <b>modules</b> due to drop impact is tested using jigs where the <b>display</b> <b>modules</b> are installed. In this study, jigs of cellular phones for drop impact test of OLED modules were designed. The material, thickness and number and orientation of ribs were considered as design variables. Jigs were designed in a way that responses of modules due to drop impact were similar to those of modules in cellular phones. The maximum principal stresses at the upper glasses of modules were considered as responses, which were analyzed using a commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit. The drop impact analysis at the height of 1. 5 meters showed that the responses o...|$|R

40|$|Uncovering and {{interpreting}} phenotype/genotype relationships {{are among the}} most challenging open questions in disease studies. Set cover approaches are explicitly designed to provide a representative set for diverse disease cases and thus are valuable in studies of heterogeneous datasets. At the same time pathway-centric methods have emerged as key approaches that significantly empower studies of genotype-phenotype relationships. Combining the utility of set cover techniques with the power of network-centric approaches, we designed a novel approach that extends the concept of set <b>cover</b> to network <b>modules</b> <b>cover.</b> We developed two alternative methods to solve the <b>module</b> <b>cover</b> problem: (i) an integrated method that simultaneously determines network modules and optimizes the coverage of disease cases. (ii) a two-step method where we first determined a candidate set of network modules and subsequently selected modules that provided the best coverage of the disease cases. The integrated method showed superior performance in the context of our application. We demonstrated the utility of the <b>module</b> <b>cover</b> approach for the identification of groups of related genes whose activity is perturbed in a coherent way by specific genomic alterations, allowing the interpretation of the heterogeneity of cancer cases. 1...|$|R
