The first single actually issued from this album was Alone in My Room, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. 'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she had in her Skunk Anansie days.|$|E

A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E

We <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> tapes run and play like we do when we're playing live; do a three-hour track and then cut it up into pieces, use one piece as a complete section, and join it up to another piece with a synthesiser link or something... It's improvised, but it's together in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{first major}} break {{came from his}} {{starring}} role in director Barry Levinson's Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film is set in 1965 during the Vietnam War, with Williams {{playing the role of}} Adrian Cronauer, a radio shock jock who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, he created voice impressions of people, including Walter Cronkite, Gomer Pyle, Elvis Presley, Mr. Ed, and Richard Nixon. [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> cameras roll," [...] said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams [...] "managed to create something new for every single take." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles stuttered {{throughout}} his career despite trying almost every sort of stuttering therapy, ranging from rhythmic control, relaxation, slow speech, and breathing exercises, to psychoanalysis and hypnosis. He eventually managed to become very fluent even though he continued to stutter. Charles {{wrote in a letter}} to a newsletter that he had lived a [...] "very successful and happy life", a result of an idea that came to him while hitch-hiking his way home from Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where he had spent a month as the hired man on a farm, pretending to be a deaf mute because his stuttering was so severe that he could not get any other employment: he met an old stutterer who said that he was [...] "too old and tired to fight myself now so I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> words leak out"; Charles realised that he should have been seeking a way of stuttering that would be tolerable both to others and himself, instead of avoiding and hiding his stutter.|$|E

5000|$|Britney Spears, {{about to}} go {{out in front of her}} largest ever concert {{audience}} in Rio de Janeiro in 2001, allegedly complained about the organization of her entourage, saying, [...] "Don't tell me that they're <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> audience <b>just</b> fucking stand out there like that. Oh my God! This is retarded." [...] Her record company denied that it was Spears' voice that was broadcast to the 170,000 in attendance at the event.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an article}} by Tim Hanson that {{appeared}} in the Spokesman Review article on August 26, 1984 Schuckardt is quoted as saying: [...] "If there is some way I can <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> people know we didn't run away. We were sent away. We were thrown out of our home. If there was anyway we could have stayed there, we would have. They must know that it was made impossible." [...] The article goes on to state that On June 7, 1984 Chicoine filed a lawsuit in Superior court asking that Schuckardt and 10 of his associates be prohibited from returning to the church property at Mount St. Michael's or Schuckardt's mansion at E2314 South Altamont Blvd. As a result of this lawsuit, a document was served at his mansion. The article states: [...] "Schuckardt said last week he thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued." [...] Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: [...] "There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on [...] "either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property." [...] Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.|$|E

50|$|The {{attempt to}} {{exacerbate}} relations between allies is one method of diverting hatred from an enemy and was attempted {{by both the}} Allied and Central Powers in World War I.

5000|$|Others helped {{perpetuate}} the story over the years. Tom Meany, {{who worked for}} Joe Williams {{at the time of}} the called shot, later wrote a popular but often embellished 1947 biography of Ruth. In the book, Meany wrote, [...] "He pointed to center field. Some say it was merely as a gesture towards Root, others that he was <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> Cubs bench know that he still had one big one left.
