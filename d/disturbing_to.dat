5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
5|$|More <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> Lord Howe {{were the}} actions of HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and {{allowing}} her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of the}} line.|$|E

25|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{is perhaps}} amongst the most {{shocking}} of contemporary Victorian novels. In seeking to present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past {{as an artist and}} wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.|$|E
25|$|The internecine struggles {{between the}} two camps was, however, <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> the Comintern, which sent a {{representative}} to oversee the Party's 1925 convention. A telegram from the Comintern directed the Party, after a vote which Foster had won decisively over his opponent, Benjamin Gitlow, to install Ruthenberg as {{general secretary of the}} Party. Foster challenged the telegram, stormed out of the meeting, and attempted to appeal to the Comintern itself, over the objections of his opponents and even his allies in the Cannon faction, who would not accept the possibility that the Comintern could be wrong.|$|E

25|$|After the rupture of {{the wars}} with Portugal and Catalonia, the Junta changed its attitude, this time {{due to the}} {{exhaustion}} of Galicia, now involved not just in naval or oversea operations, but also in an exhausting war with the Portuguese, war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> the local economy and commerce. So, {{in the second half}} of the 17th century the Junta frequently denied or considerably reduced the initial petitions of the monarch, and though the tension didn't rise to the levels experienced in Portugal or Catalonia, there were frequent urban mutinies and some voices even asked for the secession of the Kingdom of Galicia.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{air superiority}} was {{maintained}} {{during the height}} of both battles, and the increased effectiveness of Allied air activity proved <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> the German Army's top-level Oberste Heeresleitung command staff. A complete reorganisation of the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches into what became officially known as the Luftstreitkräfte followed and had generally been completed by October 1916. This reorganisation eventually produced the German strategic bombing squadrons that were to produce such consternation in England in 1917 and 1918, and the specialist close support squadrons (Schlachtstaffeln) that gave the British infantry such trouble at Cambrai and during the German Spring offensive of 1918. Its most famous and dramatic effect, however, involved the raising of specialist fighter squadrons or Jagdstaffeln – a full year after similar units had become part of the RFC and the French Aéronautique Militaire. Initially these units were equipped with the Halberstadt D.II (Germany's first biplane fighter), the Fokker D.I and D.II, along with the last few surviving Eindeckers, all three biplane design types using a single lMG 08, before the Fokker D.III and Albatros D.I twin-gun types arrived at the Front.|$|E

500|$|The book {{moves on}} to the various foreign orchids Darwin had {{received}} from others. His experiments showed that the [...] "astonishing length" [...] of the 11inch (290mm) long nectary hanging from Angraecum sesquipedale flowers implied {{the need for an}} as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 10–11inches (250–275mm) long to pollinate these flowers in Madagascar. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that [...] "there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths". This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race, but was <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{with the}} arrival of PT-35, all of MacArthur's group had reached Mindanao safely, but there were no {{aircraft}} at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked [...] {{in the hope that the}} general would have some news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> the party, as the Japanese were only [...] away, at Davao on the south coast of Mindanao.|$|E
500|$|The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese {{neighboring}} Robinson's) who had alleged the [...] "touching", {{was then}} {{reported to have}} said, during the investigating committee's telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of what felt to him like intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as [...] "natural," [...] yet the incidents were <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> him nonetheless. The investigating committee's report also stated that man regretted having used the word [...] "harassment" [...] in his e-mail, and that man declined an invitation to bring formal charges. After a two-day investigation, neither allegation proved of merit. The House of Bishops voted for Robinson in the affirmative, with 62 in favor, 43 opposed, and 2 abstaining.|$|E
500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} the action {{sequences}} and violence with several noting they were better suited to a theatrical version rather than literature.

Reviewers {{also noted that the}} [...] "action sequences [...] keep the critique from becoming preachy" [...] or otherwise too serious. In The San Diego Union-Tribune, the reviewer wrote [...] "As a motorhead, I liked a lot of elements in this novel. On the other hand, I found a lot of the corporate and corp-rat behavior ranged from <b>disturbing</b> <b>to</b> disgusting." [...] The reviewer in The Mercury concluded, [...] "This is not comfortable or enjoyable bedtime reading.
