5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator <b>football</b> <b>players</b> practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his <b>football</b> <b>players</b> did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that <b>football</b> <b>players</b> were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that <b>football</b> <b>players</b> were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
