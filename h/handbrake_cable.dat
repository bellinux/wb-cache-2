5000|$|August - 5488/5537 - Pivoting {{quadrant}} {{on radius}} arm for <b>handbrake</b> <b>cable</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulically}} operated simplex brakes were operated via a single circuit, which was usual at the time. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>cable</b> {{was prone to}} rust.|$|E
50|$|Brakes {{were the}} same across the range using a hub {{integrated}} (i.e. not a hat rotor) front ventilated disc design of 287 mm and single piston callipers sliding on the hub carrier. The rear used solid discs also at 287 mm and the rear callipers carried over the Ford handbrake system using a threaded piston applying the <b>handbrake</b> <b>cable</b> forces to the rear disc pads.|$|E
50|$|Steering is by {{rack and}} pinion and has a {{comparatively}} low ratio. MacPherson strut suspension is used at the front and semi-trailing arms at the rear. Brakes are by disc and single-piston calipers at the front, with drums at the rear also serving for <b>handbrake</b> function, via <b>cables.</b>|$|R
