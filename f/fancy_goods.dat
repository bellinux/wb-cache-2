5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small <b>fancy</b> <b>goods,</b> {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125. In 2005 the base of the cross was rediscovered in excavations during renovation of the market area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.|$|E

Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion Of Happiness print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the copyright, the Ives family chose lithographer F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion Of Happiness in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new litho stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained. In addition to continue publishing The Mansion of Happiness, H. P. Ives and A. A. Weeks published at least two new games: Experts and Tournament & Knighthood.|$|E

Main Street consists mostly of clothes shops and the cross roads, which are known as Cross Streets where {{each of the five}} streets specializes in a specific business. For example, the First Cross Street is mostly electronic goods shops, the Second cellular phones and <b>fancy</b> <b>goods.</b> Most of these businesses are dominated by Muslim traders. At the end of the Main Street further away from Fort is the Sea Street — Sri Lanka's gold market — dominated by Tamil interests. This mile-long street is full of jewellery shops, including the former head office of SriLankan Airlines.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{was born}} near the Old Town Square in Prague, then {{part of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family were middle-class Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a [...] or ritual slaughterer in Osek, a Czech village with a large Jewish {{population}} located near Strakonice in southern Bohemia. Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used {{the image of a}} jackdaw ( [...] in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as kafka) as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in Poděbrady, and was better educated than her husband.|$|E
500|$|Henry Brougham {{wrote of}} the public {{reaction}} to Charlotte's death, [...] "It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child." [...] The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. [...] Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. [...] The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. [...] Even gambling dens shut down {{on the day of}} her funeral, as a mark of respect. [...] Wrote The Times, [...] "It certainly does not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity." [...] Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. [...] A dissenting note was struck by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in his An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for plotting to overthrow the government was a greater tragedy.|$|E
500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E

Our object is rather to show that what might very naturally be supposed to be trifling and easy work, is, in truth, very much the reverse.|$|R

While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} £40 from a Quaker charity. In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, [...] "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?" [...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank." [...] That job was an entry-level position in Singer & Friedlander.|$|E
2500|$|After Kelly and Schroeder {{had moved}} in, two other well-to-do men of German {{extraction}} made country retreats {{for themselves in}} Woodside. They were Gustav Sussdorf and Louis Windmuller. [...] Like Kelly and Schroeder, Sussdorf was a Charleston merchant. [...] In 1859 he sold his <b>fancy</b> <b>goods</b> business and moved to New York. Not long after, he bought a farm owned by the family of Thomas Cumberson {{who had died in}} 1849. It is quite possible that he learned of the place through acquaintance with Schroeder or, more likely, Kelly. [...] Windmuller was of a younger generation than Kelly, Schroeder, and Sussdorf. [...] He emigrated to New York {{in the aftermath of the}} Revolutions of 1848. [...] Only 18 years old and penniless, he found success as a commission agent, bringing goods to clients in the U.S. from Germany and other European countries. In 1867 he had accumulated enough savings to buy property adjoining Sussdorf's. The land had formerly belonged to the Morrell family, but had been acquired by a speculator, Antonie J.D. Mecke, and became available to Windmuller on Mecke's going bankrupt.|$|E

2500|$|It remains {{unsettled}} whether {{promissory estoppel}} may arise in pre-contractual relationships. In the case Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr [...] 2 All ER 753 CA, a landlord made an oral promise to his tenants {{that if they}} bought a 99 year lease to their flats he would repair the roofs of the flats at his own expense. After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof {{at a cost of}} £15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that promissory estoppel may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in Durham <b>Fancy</b> <b>Goods</b> v Michael Jackson [...] 2 QB 839, [...] where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is “a pre-existing legal relationship which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties”.|$|E

It was--this is not one of those mystery stories--it was Clarence Tresillian. Over the heads of the bevy of gilded youths who clustered round the stall their eyes met. A thrill ran through Isabel. She dropped her eyes. The next moment Clarence had made his spring; the gilded youths had shredded away like a mist, and he was leaning towards her, opening negotiations for the purchase of a yellow Teddy-bear at sixteen times its face value.|$|E
60|$|The {{bills of}} lading, and some notes and letters which lay upon the desk, sufficed to inform {{me that the}} Brazilian brig Nossa Sehnora da Vittoria had cleared from Bahia a month before.

She was bound for London, and a glance at the bills of lading was {{sufficient}} to show me that we were not likely to profit {{much in the way of}} salvage. Her cargo consisted of nuts, ginger, and wood, the latter in the shape of great logs of valuable tropical growths. It was these, no doubt, which had prevented the ill-fated vessel from going to the bottom, but they were of such a size as to make it impossible for us to extract them. Besides these, there were a few <b>fancy</b> <b>goods,</b> such as a number of ornamental birds for millinery purposes, and a hundred cases of preserved fruits.

60|$|Having {{become quite}} an old {{inhabitant}} of Dobbo, I will endeavour to sketch {{the sights and}} sounds that pervade it, and the manners and customs of its inhabitants. The place is now pretty full, and the streets present a far more cheerful aspect than when we first arrived. Every house is a store, where the natives barter their produce for what they are most in need of. Knives, choppers, swords, guns, tobacco, gambier, plates, basins, handkerchiefs, sarongs, calicoes, and arrack, are the principal articles wanted by the natives; but some of the stores contain also tea, coffee, sugar, wine, biscuits, &c., for the supply of the traders; and others are full of <b>fancy</b> <b>goods,</b> china ornaments, looking-glasses, razors, umbrellas, pipes, and purses, which take the fancy of the wealthier natives. Every fine day mats are spread before the doors and the tripang is put out to dry, as well as sugar, salt, biscuit, tea, cloths, and other things that get injured by an excessively moist atmosphere. In the morning and evening, spruce Chinamen stroll about or chat at each other's doors, in blue trousers, white jacket, and a queue into which red silk is plaited till it reaches almost to their heels. An old Bugis hadji regularly takes an evening stroll in all the dignity of flowing green silk robe and gay turban, followed by two small boys carrying his sirih and betel boxes.|$|E
