50|$|For the individual, {{there are}} a few {{suggestions}} to be made in regards to becoming a <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple</b> based on implications of past research. First, the division of labor should be discussed and made clear to both spouses, so it each individual’s expectations are apparent. The stability of the relationship should also be considered, as well as the possible reactions each individual might have in response to societal views. The expenses of traveling and each spouse’s history of being alone (i.e., their attachment styles) should be considered as well. Finally, couples should consider discussing the decision with other commuter couples to gain first-hand knowledge. Organization, frequent communication, and rituals {{have been found to be}} three of the most important aspects of successfully maintaining a commuting lifestyle. Weekly organized meetings can provide an opportunity for the couple to practice communication, improve organization, take care of household responsibilities, and keep in touch about past and future events. Developing a set of rituals and schedules can help commuter couples ease the stress of departing and reuniting with each other. Rituals such as daily phone calls, sharing dinner while talking on the phone, regular dependable visitation times, a predictable routine for reuniting and departing, special dinner dates for their first nights together, and leaving intimate messages and signs of affection have been found to be helpful for many commuter couples. These rituals help the couple establish a shared history that they can draw on during lonely moments.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the field}} of study {{regarding}} coupled careers is extending, {{it has not yet}} focussed on the glass ceiling effect. In this article, partner effects on promotions to top positions are investigated. Discrete time event history analysis is performed on data from the Panel Study of Belgian Households (PSBH, 1994 – 2001). Two types of partner effects are analysed: the effect of having a partner and the effect of certain characteristics of the partner. The data do not provide evidence for effects of merely having a partner. With regard to partner characteristics, it is confirmed that positive partner effects dominate, both for labour market and for financial resources. These results can be explained by social capital theory: resources of the partner stimulate the personal social capital and therefore also the personal career. Therefore, it is stated that being in a <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple</b> {{is in the interest of}} both partners’ individual careers. On the other hand, a negative effect of the number of working hours of the male partner on women’s promotion probabilities is found.

More {{and more}} couples are working full-time in Canada {{giving rise to}} the dual career phenomenon. On the other hand, more and more social scientists are doing research on careers from {{different points of view}} including the one adopted in this study; that is, the organizational point of view. Since working couples, and especially dual-career couples, are more numerous, it seems appropriate to study their potential effects on organizational life. We know almost nothing about the impact on an organization of having members of dual career couples, in terms of performance, job satisfaction, absenteism, turnover, etc. Rapoport and Rapoport (1978) noted the absence of the employer's point of view in research on working couples. There are a few exceptions. Rosen et al (1975), Berger and Wright (1977) and Le Louarn and DeCotiis (1982) have studied the effect of a dual-career status on several personnel decisions within organizations. The results of the empirical studies suggest that being a member of a <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple</b> could be a hindrance when it cornes to making important decisions like hiring, promoting, relocating, etc. In those cases, employers belonging to a <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple</b> are perceived as a greater risk for an organization than a member of a single career family. It is feared that if the spouse does not like the new place, or finds another job somewhere else, the couple (including the newly hired or transferred employee) will leave the organization (Holmstrom, 1972). Following these three studies, one can ask whether some of thèse decisions {{have an impact on the}} career progression of the manager when he or she is a member of a working couple. Mooney (1981) and Pfeffer and Ross (1982) have already shown the negative effect on salary of being married to somebody who works. The purpose of this study is to pursue this Une of research by studying the impact of a working couple status on managers' career progression using three different definitions of this construct. It is hypothesized that: (1) the more a spouse works outside home, the less is the manager's salary, hierarchical level and number of promotions obtained when the effect of certain variables is controlled; (2) the effect of the working spouse on these three variables will be different according to the manager's sex and whether he or she works in the public or private sector. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire sent to managers from Quebec as part of a larger study conducted by the last two authors. The data from the public sector corne from ail segments of the governmental bureaucracy. Those from the private sector corne from a chain of retail food stores. Data were collected at two different periods of time in 1982 and represent ail the hierarchical levels of the organization. The total sample size is 2324 (1817 from the public and 507 from the private sector). The results show that the salary level of the respondents is negatively related to the working spouse status. That is, when the effects of age, education, spoken language (English or French), sex, civil status (married or not), sector (public or private), hierarchical level, number of promotions, number of employers, length of service and global performance are controlled, the manager who is married to a working spouse has significantly lower salary that the one who is married to somebody who does not work outside the house. Having a working spouse, however, has no significant effect on the manager's hierarchical level on his or her number of promotions. When the sample is divided into two parts, the results of the multiple regression shows that the negative effect on salary is only true in the public sector and for the men only. Different explanations for these results results are presented and suggestions are made for future research on the effect of dual-career couples on organizational life...|$|E
40|$|With dual-career couples {{comprising}} {{the most common}} family type, {{it is important for}} mental health professionals, employers, and policy makers to understand the unique challenges of this population (Haddock et al., 2001; Saginak & Saginak, 2005.) Numerous researchers have studied the consequences of family and work role strain for dual-career couples. However, when dual-career couples are able to share responsibilities and negotiate degendered roles they experience the benefits of dual-career couples. The literature clearly supports the importance of egalitarian roles for marital satisfaction and life satisfaction of dual-career couples. While researchers have studied social role strain, gender role strain, marital satisfaction, and life satisfaction and discussed the importance of degendered roles and responsibilities for dual-career couples, no studies have examined gender ideology. Saginak and Saginak (2005) called for researchers to investigate how gender ideologies and the gender socialization process perpetuate the challenges faced by dual-career couples in balancing work and family. This study investigated the associations between gender ideology and gender role strain, job-family role strain, marital satisfaction, and life satisfaction among 70 individual members of dual-career couples. A multivariate analysis of variance was utilized to investigate the relationship between gender ideology and the criterion measures. Gender ideology was partially associated with gender role strain with the androgynous gender ideology group scoring significantly lower on gender role strain than the masculine or undifferentiated gender ideology groups but not significantly lower than the feminine gender ideology group. Gender ideology was not associated with job-family role strain or marital satisfaction. In addition, gender ideology was also partially associated with life satisfaction with the androgynous gender ideology group scoring significantly higher on quality of life than the masculine or undifferentiated gender ideology groups but not significantly higher than the feminine gender ideology group. Thus, the current study indicates there are partial associations between gender ideology and gender role strain and life satisfaction for dual-career couples. Mental health professionals, employers, and policy makers working with dual-career couples should assess the socially constructed gender norms and expectations internalized by individuals into a gender ideology as the possible source of challenges experienced by the <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple...</b>|$|E

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComResearch {{indicates}} that approximately {{fifteen years ago}} there were over three (3) million dualcareer couples representing 20 % of dual-worker couples. It is expected {{that the amount of}} dual-career couples will continue to increase, as most college students, both men and women, anticipate participating in a career as well as in a family (Spiker- Miller & Kees, 1995). Individuals and organizations are confronted with a hyper turbulent environment and individuals are also faced with a myriad of challenges and adversity in their work and personal lives. Due to the economy and the changing needs of individuals, today very few families reflect the configuration of a typical family (a husband who worked outside the home, a wife who fulfilled the duties of homemaker and child-carer), as both partners are normally employed. The <b>dual-career</b> <b>couple</b> phenomenon has added to the pressure of managing multiple demands and has a considerable impact on the nature of people's careers(Greenberg & Baron, 2003). Dual-career couples‘ career advancement is largely affected by the career barriers they perceive to encounter. The perceptions of career barriers encountered differ from one couple to another based on factors such as: age, race and parental demand(children). Differences may also exist between partners in a dual-career relationship based on their gender. Most studies that have been conducted have looked at work-life balance of dual-career couples or have focused on the problems dual-career couples face solely from the woman‘s perspective. The aim {{of this study is to}} look at dual-career couples not only from female‘s perspective and to tap into their perceptions regarding career barriers encountered in the workplace. The findings could help organisations realize the importance of assisting dualcareer couples and how they could improve their career development. Dual-career couples therefore warrant attention as a special group seeing as the career salience, strategies and transitions of one partner inevitably affects those of the other, which could also have repercussions for their employers (Smith, 1997). A self-developed Demographic Questionnaire and the Career Barriers Inventory (Revised) was used to gather the data. The research was conducted within a large retail organisation. The sample comprised of men and women, permanent and contract employees within the following departments: Human Resources, Marketing, Logistics, Finance, Group Merchandise Procurement (GMP), Buying, Sourcing, Audit, Planning and Group Services. The sampling procedure that was utilised was non-probability sampling. Statistical analyses involved descriptive statistics (Frequencies, Means and Standard deviations) and inferential statistics (T-Test and Analysis of variance). The study revealed that the most highly rated career barriers which respondents perceived to experience or which affected their career advancement were multiple-role conflict, decisionmaking difficulties, sex discrimination and racial discrimination. Whilst, the career barriers which were rated the lowest by respondents included disapproval by significant others, disability/health concerns and discouraged from choosing non-traditional careers. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the perceptions of dual-career couples based on gender regarding career barriers in the workplace is partially accepted because there are statistically significant differences regarding the perceptions amongst females and males in terms of lack of confidence as a career barrier. The hypothesis proposing that there are significant differences in the perceptions of dual-career couples who have and those who do not have children, is partially accepted, as there was a statistically significant difference regarding disapproval by significant others. The findings for the perceptions of dual-career couples based on race regarding career barriers in the workplace is partially supported because significant differences were found for the following career barriers: difficulties with network/socialisation, lack of confidence and race discrimination based on employees‘ race. Lastly, significant differences in the perceptions of dual-career couples based on age regarding career barriers in the workplace was rejected, as no significant differences regarding career barriers based on employees‘ age were found. Amongst others, a limitation of this study is evident. The study may lack generisability as the sampling procedure used was non-probability sampling and only included those employees who were easily accessible. Additionally, a quantitative study was used by making use of questionnaires, but no observation or interviews were used. The present study also only focuses on the differences in perceptions of dual-career couples, based on biographical factors such as; gender, age, number of children (parental demands), race and age. Ideally all research should have a broad speck of people or participants, to ensure higher generalizability. In an effort to deal with the limitations of the current study, the following are recommended, future research should use a large proportionate stratified random sample as this would allow the findings to be reliably generalised to the population. A combination of both quantitative and qualitative methodology would help to develop detailed understanding of dual-career couple‘s and their differences in perceptions of career barriers. It is important for organisations to have continuous negotiations with employees in order to integrate the demands of the organisation and the career needs of its employees. Furthermore,they should respond to the shifting demographics by adopting voluntary policies such as alternative work schedules and child and elder care assistance to help workers meet family needs, which in turn will be beneficial to the organisation by attracting and retaining the best talent...|$|E

I embarked on this study from an interpretivist stance in terms of which a qualitative research strategy, using in-depth, semi-structured life-story interviews, was employed in order to gain a greater understanding of the various factors that mould the perceptions that couples currently hold with regard to the career advancement of women. Purposive as well as snowball sampling strategies were used to identify nine <b>dual-career</b> Indian <b>couples,</b> who constituted the sample for this study. A comprehensive analysis was conducted that involved thematic analysis. This process was aided by using the qualitative analysis software Atlas. ti. The results of this study reveal that, although there is a shift towards greater acceptance of career women, the spouses have not reached a level of parity as Indian women are not completely emancipated from their duties in the home domain.

Two key assumptions of the model are that occupations differ both in wages and in an amenity termed flexibility, and that children require a nontrivial amount of parental time that has no market substitute. When men and women face identical labor market conditions but women have an advantage in child care, men always have a higher return to entering the higherearning occupation than women. Occupations with more costly flexibility, modeled as a nonlinearity in wages, have a lower fraction of women, less positive assortative mating on earnings, and lower fertility among <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples.</b> Costly flexibility may induce highearning couples to share home production, which rewards husbands who are simultaneously high-earning and productive in child care.

Similarities and differences from previous findings and implications are discussed. ANTECEDENTS AND OUTCOMES OF WORK-FAMILY INTERFACE Work and family conflicts have emerged as an increasingly important research topic in the last few decades.

Furthermore, today’s workplace is increasingly populated with working parents, single parents, and <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> (Thomas & Ganster, 1995).

25|$|In August 1990, Power Partners: How Two-Career Couples Can Play to Win, {{written by}} Cuozzo's wife Jane, was published. As both Cuozzo {{and his wife}} had careers as writers, the book focused on how <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> can enhance their {{relationships}} by promoting each other's careers. The book played on tennis analogies and suggested that couples behave as coordinated doubles teams—for instance, providing their spouses' business card at opportune times to help them acquire new clients or accounts. About two years later, in November 1992, Cuozzo's father-in-law Solomon G. Hershey died.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{statistics}} from {{as early as}} 1989 report that 53% of married households were dual-earner couples. By 1996, the percent of dual-earner couples grew to 61%. According to data from 1989, approximately 7 million employees (15% to 20% of all dual-earner marriages) were classified as <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples.</b> By 2003, U.S. workers take more than 400 million long-distance business trips (i.e., trips over 50 miles) each year. Commuter marriages are on the rise, with recent estimates indicating {{that as many as}} 3 million Americans reside in different locations from their spouses.|$|R
40|$|The dual-career {{phenomenon}} {{has become increasingly}} prevalent worldwide. This lifestyle often generates stresses and strains, {{at home and at}} work, for couples juggling multiple demands, which can have negative consequences for organisations. While most empirical research into this lifestyle has been conducted in the United States and Britain, very little has been carried out in Australia. This particular study, based on data from an Australian sample of 121 lawyers and accountants, was therefore aimed at analysing the levels of stress, work-family conflict and overload among <b>dual-career</b> and single-career <b>couples.</b> The results confirm that <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> experience higher levels of stress, work-family conflict and overload than single-career couples. To enhance labour productivity and organisational effectiveness, human resource managers therefore need to take account of the potential for dual-career stress, overload and conflict, and respond flexibly to dual-career employee status...|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} {{econometric model}} of retirement of <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> is specified and estimated with panel {{data from the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women. A coincidence of spouses retiring together, despite the younger ages of wives, suggests explicit efforts at coordination. The estimates suggest that one reason is a correlation of tastes for leisure. More important, each spouse, and perhaps husbands in particular, values retirement more once their spouse has retired. The opportunity set accounts for peaks in the retirement hazards of each spouse individually, but not for peaks in the simultaneous retirement of both spouses.

40|$|The work-family life {{conflict}} affects {{various aspects}} of dual-career families. Parenthood and the work-family life balance lead to an overload of responsibility and disparity {{at the expense of}} women, on a private as well as on a social level. In our research, we examined WIF (work to family) and FIW (family to work) conflicts in a sample of 483 <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples.</b> The main results underline an increase in familiar duties concerning child birth and childcare, as associated with the traditional work-family life balance strategy. The data seems to reflect differences in traditional roles between public-male- breadwinner and private-female-homemaker...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} of strategic international human resource management models. It then focuses on the practical implementations of specific human resource policies in an international environment. It suggests human resource management strategies to manage expatriate managers as well as highlights best practices for expatriate and local staffing, recruitment and planning. It recognises the complexities of adaptation of expatriate <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> and women managers and provides examples of managerial interest in international assignments. It explores cross-cultural training of expatriates, complexities of performance evaluation for expatriates and discusses issues in designing an international compensation policy...|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in women’s career opportunities also increases {{the problems of}} couples pursuing two careers in the same place, and can cause conflict regarding which spouse’s career should take precedence. One major concern for <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> is finding employment in the same geographic location. One partner usually compromises by taking a less desirable job so that the other can take a position that might further his or her career. However, if this compromise cannot be reached, the option of commuting can be the result, where both spouses enjoy highly desirable jobs at the sacrifice of maintaining separate residences.|$|R
40|$|Orientation: Spousal {{support is}} a crucial area to explore, {{particularly}} due to the increased prevalence of <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> in South Africa and the dynamics facing them. Research purpose: The main objective {{of this study was}} to explore Indian wives’ perceptions regarding the support they receive from their husbands and the impact that such support has on their career progression. Motivation for the study: The limited qualitative research available globally on the subject and the dearth of research that focuses on Indian professional females in the South African context motivated the study. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative research approach was followed, and the data were collected through in-depth, life-story interviews. Purposeful and snowball sampling methods yielded a sample of nine Indian female managers who were in dual-career marriages. Main findings: Spouses are essential sources of support for Indian professional women. The findings revealed that there are various marital and socio-cultural dynamics that impact on the spousal support received by these women, which ultimately influences their career advancement. Practical/managerial implications: The findings provided valuable information regarding the marital challenges that Indian women face in their career progression. The awareness of such dynamics can assist management in devising strategies to accommodate and retain the unique talent that Indian women have to offer. Contribution/value-add: The study contributes to the evolving body of knowledge on <b>dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> by focusing on an under-researched, but essential aspect of the dual-career arrangement. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Gilbert and Rachlin {{address the}} {{difference}} between dual-earner families and dual-career families, distinguishing that dual-earner couples are those in which both spouses are earning for the family, but {{one or both of}} them consider their occupational involvement as a job. Jobs are unlike careers in that they do not require extensive training or commitment. In dual-earner couples, one spouse's work is generally considered secondary. <b>Dual-career</b> <b>couples</b> are families in which [...] "both heads of household pursue careers {{and at the same time}} maintain a family life together". Both have high degrees of commitment to their careers, and neither partner's career is thought to be more important than that of the other.|$|R
