50|$|<b>Invisible</b> <b>mending</b> is labour {{intensive}} and very time consuming {{and it may}} sometimes be cheaper to replace the garment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Invisible</b> <b>mending</b> is a {{sophisticated}} weaving method consisting in rebuilding {{the fabric of}} a damaged garment or upholstery, following damage caused for example by a snag, burn, or accidental scissor cut.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} 1970s, <b>invisible</b> <b>mending</b> was common practice, but {{has now become}} a fine craft {{associated}} with tapestry weaving. However, it is a service that is still provided by quality dry cleaners.|$|E
50|$|In such an incident, {{both the}} warp and the weft of fabric {{may have been}} damaged. <b>Invisible</b> <b>mending</b> is the {{reconstruction}} of both the warp and weft using a long needle. The mender garners the material for the repair by picking all the necessary weft from the hem, and the warp from the extra fabric {{on the inside of}} longitudinal seams. The mender will reconstruct the warp and weft to match the original weave exactly. After this is done and the garment has been pressed, the mended part will be undetectable {{on the outside of the}} fabric, though on the reverse side the restored area will be marked by long hanging threads where the re-weaving was done. These hanging threads occur because (unlike in darning work) <b>invisible</b> <b>mending</b> is done without tacking, in case it deforms the fabric.|$|E

Mike Ladd's new collection, <b>Invisible</b> <b>Mending</b> ranges across genres including essay, memoir, short story and poetry. Based loosely on the ideas of scarring and healing, <b>Invisible</b> <b>Mending</b> extends from family intimacies to connection and disconnection in the Australian community, environmental damage and repair. It also has an international view. Parts of it were written at an artist's residency in Malaysia and while travelling through South America...|$|E
