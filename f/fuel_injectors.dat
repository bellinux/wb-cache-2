40|$|Abstract. <b>Fuel</b> <b>injector</b> in {{automotive}} {{engine is}} a very important component in injecting the correct amount of fuel into the combustion chamber. The injection system need to be in a very safe and optimum condition during the engine operation. The mulfunction of the injection system can be avoided if the current working condition is known and a proper maintenence procedure is implemented. This paper proposes the development of a <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> monitoring method using strain signals captured by a single-channel strain gage attached on the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> body. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> was operated under three main sets of parameters; pulse width (ms), frequency (Hz) and pressure (bar) which were varried from 5 ms to 15 ms, 17 Hz to 25 Hz and 10 bar to 70 bar respectively. The settings produce 27 different engine operations and the strain signal will be captured at each operation. The captured strain signals will be analyzed using I-kazTM Multilevel technique and will be correlated with the main parameters. The relationship between the I-kazTM Multilevel coefficient and the main parameters indicate good correlations which can be used as the guidance for <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> monitoring during actual operation. The I-kaz Multilevel technique was found to be very suitable in this study since it is capable of showing consistence pattern change at every parameter change during the engine operation. This monitoring system has a big potential to be developed and improved for the optimization of <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> system performance in the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Low-emissions combustor design is crucially important to gas turbine engine manufacturers. Unfortunately, many designs are susceptible to unsteady oscillations that can result in structural fatigue and increased noise. Computational approaches that resolve flow unsteadiness, for example Large Eddy Simulation (LES), are being explored as one avenue to help understand such phenomena. However, in order to quantifY the accuracy of LES predictions, benchmark validation data in suitably chosen test cases are required. Comprehensive experimental data covering both time-averaged and timeresolved features are currently scarce. It was {{the aim of this}} thesis, therefore, to provide such data. in a configuration representing the near-field of a typical gas turbine <b>fuel</b> <b>injector.</b> It was decided to focus on the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> since many unsteady events are believed to originate because of the transient interactions between the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> flow and the main combustor flow. A radial fed two-stream <b>fuel</b> <b>injector,</b> based on a preexisting industrial gas-turbine Turbomeca design was used, since this geometry was known to be susceptible to unsteadiness. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> was investigated under isothermal conditions to place emphasis on the fluid mechanical behaviour of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector,</b> including detailed capture of any unsteady phenomena present. Light Sheet Imaging (LSI) systems were used as the primary experimental technique to provide high quality spatially and temporally resolved instantaneous velocity and scalar field information in 2 D planes (using ParticieImage Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar LaserInduced Fluorescence (PUF) techniques). Several methods were employed to extract information quantifYing the flow unsteadiness and improve visualisation of timedependent large-scale turbulent structures. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis enabled clear identification of the dominant modes of energy containing structures. The results indicated that periodic high-energy containing vortex structures occurred in the swirl stream shear layer, emerging from the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector.</b> These formed a two-strong two-weak rotating vortex pattern which propagated down the main duct flow path. The formation of these vortices was found to be a function of the swirl number and originated due to an interaction between the forward moving swirl flow and the furthest upstream penetration point ofthe recirculation zone present in the main duct flow. Dependent on the magnitude of the swirl number (influencing the swirl stream cone angle) and the geometry of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector,</b> the vortex formation point was sometimes found inside the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> itself. If the vortices originated inside the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> they appeared much more coherent in space and time and of higher energy. A second unsteady high energy containing phenomenon was also identified, namely a Precessing Vortex Core (PVC), which was damped out if the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> contained a central jet. The dynamics of the PVC interacted with the dynamics of the swirl stream shear layer vortices to reduce there strength. Transient scalar measurements indicated that there was a clear connection between the unsteady vortex pattern and the rate of mixing, resulting in bursts of high heat release and is therefore identified as one source of combustor oscillations. Future <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> designs need to pay close attention to these unsteady features in selecting swirl number and internal geometry parameters...|$|R
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of <b>fuel</b> <b>injectors</b> (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of direct injection (DI) Diesel engines {{over the last}} 20 years has been quite remarkable. The trend in technology is towards diesel fuel pressurisation in the excess of 250 to 300 MPa thus leading to simultaneous reduction of soot and NOx emissions. At high diesel fuel pressures, the excessively high velocity values occurring during the discharge of the liquid through the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> nozzles (up to 660 m/s with a maximum Reynolds number of 1. 3 105 observed in this study) induce high wall friction, which in turn leads to significant fuel heating with Brinkman number values ranging from 20 to 60. The combination of significant pressure reduction within the sac volume (during low needle lifts) and the nozzles, together with high <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> wall temperatures occurring by both heat conduction from the cylinder head and heat convection from the hot gases within the engine cylinder, may potentially lead to heterogeneous flow boiling of the diesel liquid close to the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> walls. In this paper a non-isothermal study of diesel flow within a <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> is carried out. The extensive engine cylinder data available from both test results and combustion simulations are characterized {{to set up the}} appropriate thermal boundary conditions for the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations carried out in this study. The thermal boundary conditions for the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> simulations are affected by both the thermal state within the engine cylinder (which in turn is primarily affected by combustion) and hence the temperature within the cylinder head. Due to the transient nature of the engine cylinder temperature and heat transfer variations, a sensitivity analysis is performed in order to better understand the effects of such variations on the nozzle wall temperature. The steady state CHT simulations of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> are carried out, using ANSYS Fluent®, based on the assumption of single phase flow and constant physical properties of the diesel liquid. From the results of CHT simulations, a comparison between the wall nozzle temperature and the saturation temperature of the diesel liquid inside the nozzle, are presented. The second set of simulations presented here use a typical constant wall temperature of 180 C for the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> as the boundary conditions for the non-isothermal two phase cavitating flow simulations based on the assumption of variable properties of diesel liquid with respect to both temperature and pressure. These simulations were carried out using City University’s CFD code (GFS). Overall, the simulations reveal that at certain locations within the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> geometry (mainly close to the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> walls), the diesel liquid temperature reaches values well above the saturation temperature of the flowing diesel liquid, thus implying the occurrence of heterogeneous flow boiling regions within the <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> used for this study...|$|R
