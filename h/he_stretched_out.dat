500|$|Six {{placed a}} Japanese male {{at the front}} of the {{centipede}} for two reasons: first to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film. Six stated in the director's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his [...] "own nightmare." ...|$|E
500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I kept waiting for the matchup with Chrome, but he just didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that no one knew what exactly happened, [...] "We don't know if he just wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury went down, and he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Aaron first {{functioned as}} Moses' assistant. Because Moses {{complained that he}} could not speak well, God {{appointed}} Aaron as Moses' [...] "prophet" [...] (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1). At the command of Moses, he let his rod turn into a snake. Then <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues. After that, Moses tended to act and speak for himself.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} Sama is {{credited}} to Rumi, Sufi master and in whose name the Mevlevi Order was founded. The {{story of the}} creation of this unique form of dhikr tells that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day, when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, [...] "la elaha ella'llah" [...] in Arabic [...] "لا اله الا الله", or in English, [...] "There is no god but Allah (The God)", spoken by the apprentices beating the gold, and was so filled with happiness that <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> both of his arms and started spinning in a circle. With that, the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi Order were born.|$|E
2500|$|The pseudepigraphic Epistle of Barnabas, which {{scholars}} suggest {{may have}} been {{before the end of}} the 1st century, and certainly earlier than 135, whether the writer was an orthodox Christian or not, described the shape people at the time attributed to the device on which Jesus died: the comparisons it draws with Old Testament figures would have had no validity for its readers if they pictured Jesus as dying on a simple stake. Referring to what he saw as Old Testament intimations of Jesus and his cross, he likened the cross to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), thus describing it as having a crossbeam. He also wrote, with regard to : [...] "The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer, that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> his hands, and so Israel was again victorious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrick Ireland had regained {{and lost}} {{consciousness}} several times after being shot by Klebold. He crawled {{to the library}} windows where, at 2:38p.m., <b>he</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> the window, intending {{to fall into the}} arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood. They were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall. Eighteen-year-old Lisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained in the library. In a subsequent interview, she recalled hearing a comment such as, [...] "You in the library," [...] around the time of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's suicides. Kreutz lay in the library, keeping track of time by the sound of the school's bells until police arrived. She had tried to move but became light-headed. She was finally evacuated at 3:22p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson and the three library staff who had hidden in the break room.|$|E
60|$|Yes. [She {{looks at}} him, her lips quivering. <b>He</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> his arms, and she, {{breaking}} down, hides her face on his shoulder.] Now don't be an ass, Betsy.... I know you'll {{say in a}} minute I'm the only man you ever loved.|$|R

60|$|Impatient tears rise to {{the eyes}} of the {{trembling}} little beauty, and her face flames; but as she again rises to leave him in indignation, and seek protection within the house, <b>he</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> his hand towards the porch, as though he invited her to enter it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> {{his arms}} towards {{the place where}} she should be.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not so, Master. Then we {{will win}} through the reeds and lie hid in their edge till {{darkness}} comes, for in them those half-men will never dare to seek for us. Afterwards we will swim the water and disguise ourselves as jugglers and try to reach the coast, and so back to Egypt, having learned much. Never <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> your hand to Death till <b>he</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> his to you, which he will do soon enough, Master." ...|$|R
