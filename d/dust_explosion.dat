5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks <b>dust</b> <b>explosion.</b> The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Georgia sugar {{refinery}} explosion was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on February 7, 2008 in Port Wentworth, Georgia, United States. 13 {{people were killed}} and 40 injured when a <b>dust</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar. Dust explosions had been an issue of concern among United States authorities since three fatal accidents in 2003, with efforts made to improve safety and reduce the risk of recurrence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosion</b> in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>explosions</b> may be {{classified}} as being either [...] "primary" [...] or [...] "secondary" [...] in nature. Primary <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> may occur inside process equipment or similar enclosures, and are generally controlled by pressure relief through purpose-built ducting to the external atmosphere. Secondary <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> {{are the result of}} dust accumulation inside a building being disturbed and ignited by the primary explosion, resulting in a much more dangerous uncontrolled explosion inside the workplace. Historically, fatalities from <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> have largely been the result of secondary <b>dust</b> <b>explosions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Dust layers on {{the bottom}} of mine tunnels, on factory floors, or on the floors of grain {{elevator}} passages are the most frequent cause of highly destructive <b>dust</b> <b>explosions.</b> Typically, such layered <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> involve a high velocity, accelerating, turbulent flame which is fed by the dust layer and results in high destructive static and dynamic pressures. In some cases transition to detonation has been observed, and such explosions are the most destructive. Scientific studies of such layered <b>dust</b> <b>explosions,</b> conducted at the University of Michigan, are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Ignited {{methane gas}} {{is a common}} source of explosions in coal mines, which in turn can {{initiate}} more extensive coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosions.</b> For this reason, rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> {{as well as to}} limit the extent of potential explosions, in a process known as rock <b>dusting.</b> Coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> can also begin independently of methane gas explosions. Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and coal dust. For this reason, water is often used to cool rock-cutting sites.|$|R
25|$|A dust {{extractor}} should be fitted if sawdust {{is prone to}} build up under the cutting blade. Through friction the spinning blade will quickly ignite the accumulated dust, and the smoke can be mistaken for an overheated blade.

It criticized both Kings Bay for not following safety regulations and the Commissioner of Mining for not carrying out the necessary inspections. Kings Bay's board rejected the conclusions in the report, arguing that {{there had not been}} a coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{water was}} first {{produced}} in 1932, {{a few months}} after the discovery of deuterium. With the discovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, and the need for a neutron moderator that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early nuclear energy research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons. These heavy water reactors have the advantage of being able to run on natural uranium without using graphite moderators that pose radiological and <b>dust</b> <b>explosion</b> hazards in the decommissioning phase. Most modern reactors use enriched uranium with ordinary water as the moderator.|$|E
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{applying}} active barrier systems in mines is to suppress methane explosions, prevent methane explosions escalating into coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> and to suppress coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> and prevent the explosions from propagating. The use of active explosion-suppression systems {{remains one of the}} most underutilised explosion controls in underground coal mines (du Plessis and Späth 2014).|$|R

25|$|In 1993, Dr. Robert Ballard, {{the famous}} {{explorer}} who discovered Titanic and Bismarck, conducted an in-depth {{exploration of the}} wreck of Lusitania. Ballard tried to confirm John Light's findings of a large hole {{on the port side}} of the wreck, and he didn't find anything. During his investigation, Ballard noted a large quantity of coal on the sea bed near the wreck, and after consulting an explosives expert advanced the theory of a coal <b>dust</b> <b>explosion.</b> He believed dust in the bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the vibration from the explosion; the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark, causing the second explosion. In the years since he first advanced this theory, {{it has been argued that}} this is nearly impossible. Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations; additionally, the coal bunker where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{month of}} the accident, OSHA, fearing that {{relevant}} employers may be unaware their facilities presented a risk of dust explosions, {{sent a letter to}} 30,000 employees to alert them to the danger of a similar explosion occurring. OSHA also proposed the Combustible <b>Dust</b> <b>Explosion</b> and Fire Prevention Act of 2008, a new bill aimed at introducing regulations {{to reduce the risk of}} dust explosions. The bill passed the United States House of Representatives but never passed the United States Senate. In 2009 OSHA began developing a federal standard for combustible dust. Congress introduced a bill in 2013 to require OSHA to issue an interim standard based on the voluntary combustible standard set by National Fire Protection Association ...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} spherical apparatus {{for measuring}} explosion characteristics was modified to give increased and controlled turbulence within a dust–air mixture. This {{was intended to}} mimic the local effects which may occur during industrial <b>dust</b> <b>explosions,</b> particularly secondary ones which may develop in ducts or mine galleries where the initial explosion causes an increased air velocity and suspension of further quantities of dust. The results show {{that there may be}} a doubling of the maximum explosion pressure and of the rate of pressure rise during the explosion under more turbulent conditions. This is significant for modelling of <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> and suggests that explosion relief may be inadequate if this factor is not taken into consideration. The modified apparatus therefore gives a laboratory method for assessing the effect of turbulence in <b>dust</b> <b>explosions.</b> Web of Science 26121420...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>explosions</b> {{continue}} {{to represent a}} danger that must be seriously addressed, as is verified by the reports that have been gathered together for over 25 years by the Institute for Occupational Safety (BIA) of the Berufsgenossenschaften on incidents of <b>dust</b> <b>explosions.</b> The results of statistical analyses and brief incident descriptions have thus far been published in two BIA reports (no. 4 / 82 and no. 2 / 87) and have also {{been the subject of}} numerous specialist lectures. This report provides an up-date on the current situation regarding work undertaken to document these explosions. With the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic, information relating to the occurrence of <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> in the GDR could also be incorporated into the existing statistics. The present analyses are thus based on approx. 600 recorded incidents of <b>dust</b> <b>explosions,</b> and the statistical data cover the whole period of observation of experiences of <b>dust</b> <b>explosions</b> in the Federal Republic of Germany, including the new eastern German federal states, up until 1995. With this documentation, it is hoped that the main causes of explosions will be established, both in terms of specific plant characteristics and potential ignition sources. The findings thus ascertained may be a source of valuable help towards assessing the dangers and drawing up risk analyses and may, ultimately, play a considerable part in educating those affected by this problem.
