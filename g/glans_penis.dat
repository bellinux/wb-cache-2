5|$|The <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> is rounded, short, {{and small}} and is superficially divided into {{left and right}} halves by a trough {{at the top and}} a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with penile spines, except for an area near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the <b>glans</b> <b>penis,</b> the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat (Mormopterus eleryi), {{previously}} {{known as}} the hairy-rostrum or hairy-nosed freetail bat, is a small insectivorous bat {{that is the only}} member of the molossid sub-genus Setirostris. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat differs from all other bats in the Family Molossidae by possessing unique dentition, a distinctive echolocation call, diagnostic genital and <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> morphology and small body size. It is readily distinguished from other Mormopterus species by the presence of characteristic stout bristles on the muzzle and face.|$|E
40|$|A 69 -year-old male patient visited our clinic with {{complaints}} of dysuria and bleeding at the <b>glans</b> of <b>penis</b> on May 2, 1985. At the first presentation the tumor mass with necrotic and hemorrhagic character was localized around the urethral orifice {{and the entire}} <b>glans</b> of <b>penis</b> had a hard consistency. Moreover, numerous soft cutaneous nodules ranging from a small bean to a hen's egg in size spread over the total body surface. The nodules varied in property from even in height on the skin surface, half-spherical, and pedunculated. His family history was not contributory as far as neurofibromatosis was concerned. On May 15, the <b>glans</b> of <b>penis</b> was amputated and histological diagnosis was malignant melanoma with marked vascular and neural permeation. Review of the literature showed that our patient is the third case of malignant melanoma associated with neurofibromatosis in Japan...|$|R

5000|$|The head-and-body {{length is}} {{typically}} between 16 and 20.5 cm, the hindfeet measure 2.7 to 3.1 cm and the ears are 2.2 to 2.5 cm long. It weighs nearly 140 g. The dental formula is [...] - typical of all didelphids. Canines and molars are poorly developed. Differences from Marmosa species (mouse opossums) include smaller ears, longer and narrower rostrum, and greater erectness in canines. The monito del monte {{has a similar}} bushy tail. A study of the male reproductive system noted that the bushy-tailed opossum has two pairs of bulbourethral glands, as in Caluromys and Gracilinanus, but unlike other didelphids that have three pairs. The urethral grooves of the <b>glan</b> <b>penis</b> end near the tips.|$|R
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E

5000|$|Cock rings worn {{just behind}} the corona of the <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis</b> are known as glans rings, head rings or cock crowns.|$|R
5000|$|The palang (crossbar in Iban), {{better known}} in the West as ampallang in the term popularised by Doug Malloy, is a male genital {{piercing}} that penetrates horizontally through the entire <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{tip of the}} {{foreskin}} is {{too narrow}} to pass over the <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> This is normal in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner surface}} of the {{foreskin}} is fused with the <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> This is normal in children and adolescents, but abnormal in adults.|$|E
25|$|At birth, {{the inner}} {{layer of the}} {{foreskin}} is sealed to the <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> The foreskin is usually non-retractable in early childhood, and can be as late as 18.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{foreskin}} typically {{covers the}} <b>glans</b> when the <b>penis</b> is not erect (top image), but generally retracts upon erection (bottom image). Coverage of the glans in a flaccid and erect state {{varies depending on}} foreskin length ...|$|R
50|$|In its relaxed (flaccid, i.e. soft/limp) state, {{the shaft}} of the penis has {{the feel of a}} dense sponge encased in very smooth eyelid-type skin. The tip, or <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis</b> is darker in color, and covered by the foreskin, if present.|$|R
50|$|Older genital {{reassignment}} techniques made {{no attempt}} at {{the creation of a}} clitoris at all. The <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis</b> was sutured in the most distal (inner) area of the neovagina to simulate a cervix. The late Stanley Biber preferred this method.|$|R
25|$|Pathological {{phimosis}} (as {{opposed to}} the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from balanitis (inflammation of the <b>glans</b> <b>penis).</b>|$|E
25|$|In boys, {{testicular}} enlargement is {{the first}} physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed gonadarche). Testes in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3cm in length and about 1.5–2cm in width. The size of the testicles is among {{the parameters of the}} Tanner scale for male genitals, from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty. After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the penis will increase and the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions. While 18–20cm3 is an average adult size, there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population.|$|E
500|$|A {{prominent}} {{long and}} slender genital projection {{is present in}} {{both male and female}} bristle-faced free-tailed bats. The function of the projection remains unknown but these features are not shared by any other Australian Chiroptera [...] with the exception of Mormopterus norfolkensis. Males of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat also possess unique serrated lateral flanges on the acutely pointed <b>glans</b> <b>penis.</b> Features of the dentition of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat are also unique this species.|$|E
50|$|A. hadzii has all legs {{except for}} the calcaneus are very hairy and warty. Soil particles, as with most trogulidae, are tightly glued to these warts. The <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis</b> is long and has a hook at the end. The distal end of this is long and thin.|$|R
5000|$|The glans is more {{commonly}} known as the [...] "head" [...] or the [...] "tip" [...] of the penis. The medical name comes from the Latin words <b>glans</b> ('acorn') and <b>penis</b> ('of the penis') - the Latin genitive of this word has the same form as the nominative.|$|R
50|$|Males can be {{aroused by}} {{stimulation}} {{to the sides}} of the <b>glans</b> and <b>penis,</b> upper side of the glans, the foreskin, the front side of the scrotum, the skin between the scrotum and anus perineum, and around the anus. The prostate gland may be stimulated from inside the rectum, such as by anal sex, or by applying pressure on the base of the perineum near the anus. Men who report the sensation of prostate and seminal vesicles stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.|$|R
500|$|An {{inflammation}} of the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> and foreskin is called balanoposthitis, and the condition affecting the glans alone is called balanitis. [...] Most cases of these conditions occur in uncircumcised males, affecting 411% of that group. [...] The moist, warm space underneath the foreskin is thought to facilitate the growth of pathogens, particularly when hygiene is poor. [...] Yeasts, especially Candida albicans, {{are the most common}} penile infection and are rarely identified in samples taken from circumcised males. [...] Both conditions are usually treated with topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (clotrimazole cream) or low-potency steroid creams. Circumcision is a treatment option for refractory or recurrent balanoposthitis, but in recent years the availability of the other treatments have made it less necessary.|$|E
500|$|The <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> is {{long and}} robust, {{averaging}} [...] long and [...] broad, and the baculum (penis bone) is [...] long. As is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum ending in three digits. The central digit is notably larger than those at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but a broad band of nonspinous tissue is seen. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character the marsh rice rat shares only with Oligoryzomys and Oryzomys couesi among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of}} the penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except O.couesi and Holochilus brasiliensis. The baculum is deeper than it is wide.|$|E
500|$|The {{clitoris}} and penis {{are generally}} the same anatomical structure, although the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris {{of humans and}} most other animals. The idea that males have clitorises was suggested in 1987 by researcher Josephine Lowndes Sevely, who theorized that the male corpora cavernosa (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile erection) are the true counterpart of the clitoris. She argued that [...] "the male clitoris" [...] is directly beneath {{the rim of the}} <b>glans</b> <b>penis,</b> where the frenulum of prepuce of the penis (a fold of the prepuce) is located, and proposed that this area be called the [...] "Lownde's crown." [...] Her theory and proposal, though acknowledged in anatomical literature, did not materialize in anatomy books. Modern anatomical texts instead show that the clitoris displays a hood that is the equivalent of the penis's foreskin, which covers the glans, and a shaft that is attached to the glans; the male corpora cavernosa are homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis (the female cavernosa); the corpus spongiosum is homologous to the vestibular bulbs beneath the labia minora, and the scrotum is homologous to the labia minora and labia majora.|$|E
5000|$|Most men {{suffering}} from Venogenic Erectile Dysfunction start {{having trouble with}} their erections from a young age. Common complaints include; A chronic soft erection insufficient for sexual intercourse, position-dependent erectile rigidity, difficulty achieving erections, difficulty maintaining erections without constant manual stimulation and a soft <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis</b> during erection.|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the penis {{consists}} of three cylindrical bodies of spongy tissue filled with blood vessels along its length. Two of these bodies lie side-by-side in the upper portion of the penis called corpora cavernosa. The third, called the corpus spongiosum, is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form {{the tip of the}} <b>penis</b> (<b>glans).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Tapirapé didn't use any {{clothing}} whatsoever {{in their}} daily life; but men were ashamed of their <b>penis</b> <b>glans,</b> which they covered with a small cone attached to the prepuce. Women squatted and sat with their legs together. Both women and men painted their bodies with diverse designs according to age and gender. On special ceremonies and dances they would also use skirts, anklets and wrist bands.|$|R
500|$|The reflexogenic pathway {{activates}} the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} {{in response to the}} sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2–S4. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 {{may not be able to}} experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or [...] "spontaneous" [...] erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex (contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or <b>glans</b> <b>penis)</b> are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock.|$|E
2500|$|Genital lichen planus, {{which may}} cause lesions on the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> or {{skin of the}} scrotum in males, and the vulva or vagina in females. Symptoms may include lower urinary tract {{symptoms}} associated with stenosis of the urethra, painful sexual intercourse, and itching. [...] In females, Vulvovaginal-gingival syndrome, is severe and distinct variant affecting the vulva, vagina, and gums, with complications including scarring, vaginal stricture formation, or vulva destruction. The corresponding syndrome in males, affecting the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> and gums, is the peno-gingival syndrome. It is associated with HLA-DQB1.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Felidae, male felids can urinate {{backwards}} by curving {{the tip of}} the <b>glans</b> <b>penis</b> backward. Urine marking by felids is {{also known}} as [...] "spray-urinating" [...] or [...] "spray-marking".|$|E

50|$|Pheomelanins (or phaeomelanins) impart a pink to red hue, {{depending}} upon the concentration. Pheomelanins are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, <b>glans</b> of the <b>penis,</b> and vagina. When {{a small amount of}} brown eumelanin in hair, which would otherwise cause blond hair, is mixed with red pheomelanin, the result is strawberry blonde. Pheomelanin is also present in the skin, and redheads consequently often have a more pinkish hue to their skin as well.|$|R
