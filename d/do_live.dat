Oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish, who <b>do</b> <b>live</b> above the continental shelf.

They are less common on tropical islands, although a few species <b>do</b> <b>live</b> on islands such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia. Many species breed in coastal colonies, with a preference for islands, and one species, the grey gull, breeds in the interior of dry deserts far from water. Considerable variety exists in the family and species may breed and feed in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial habitats.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to health}} and {{economic}} benefits, the life expectancy in Nepal jumped from 27 years in 1951 to 65 in 2008. Most elderly Nepali citizens, roughly 85%, live in rural areas.

Traditionally, parents live with their children, and today, it is estimated that 90% of the elderly <b>do</b> <b>live</b> in the homes of their family. This number is changing as more children leave home for work or school, leading to loneliness and mental problems in Nepali elderly.|$|E

He also boasted of being a shrewd businessman by wisely investing the money made from his film career. But the Stooges received no subsequent royalties (i.e., residuals) from any of their many shorts; they were paid a flat amount for each one, and Columbia owned the rights (and profits) thereafter. However, according to Larry Fine in the 1970s, Columbia allowed the Stooges to <b>do</b> <b>live</b> tours {{when they were not}} filming in exchange for half-salary during those months. Fine indicated that the profits from the tours substantially increased their yearly take.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, In Flames became {{tired of}} using session musicians to record an album or to <b>do</b> <b>live</b> shows, so the trio asked Björn Gelotte {{to join the}} band as the {{full-time}} drummer, and 6 months later asked Anders Fridén to join the band as the full-time vocalist. That same year, the new line up recorded the band's second studio album, The Jester Race (Released in 1996). This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman, but unlike previous albums, it was co-produced by the studio's owner, Fredrik Nordström. Gelotte also provided some lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Afterwards, In Flames toured with Samael, Grip Inc., and Kreator.|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested that {{it was because of the}} band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they <b>do</b> <b>live.</b> Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished."

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up much as they <b>do</b> <b>live,</b> {{and most of the}} songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carter said that if I Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose a third movie that {{would return to the}} television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. The film grossed $4 million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10.
