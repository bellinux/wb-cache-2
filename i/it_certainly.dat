5|$|Mercator {{was welcomed}} by Duke Wilhelm who {{appointed}} him as court Cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term {{other than that}} <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy {{but at that time}} it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{ruled by}} Kenneth's descendants—older works used the name House of Alpin to {{describe}} them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín ("the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin")—lay {{to the south}} of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the River Tay. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> extended from the Firth of Forth in the south to the Mounth in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain—Druim Alban—is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of Mearns, Forfar, Perth, Fife, and Kinross. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are Dunkeld, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and Cell Rígmonaid (modern St Andrews).|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms {{consists}} of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E
5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Beginning {{in the fifth}} {{millennium}} BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. Archaeologists {{have been unable to}} prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous Mesolithic Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies. Either way, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> emerged through contact with continental Europe, probably as a result of centuries of interaction between Mesolithic people living in southeast Britain and Linear Pottery culture (LBK) communities in northeastern France. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E

25|$|Series result: a 1–0 win to Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene raised points {{similar to}} what he said after the Colombo test, saying England’s {{approach}} was too negative.

England did appear to have given up during day 2, and this possibly acted as a catalyst for the poor batting performance that followed.|$|E
25|$|Immediately at the war's end, in 1945–1946, Allis-Chalmers {{endured a}} {{crippling}} 11-month labor strike.

This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis-Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s.

25|$|Also {{much like}} Williams is the {{theological}} and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes {{the ideas of}} good vs. evil quite seriously and probes deeply into the idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous shaking down before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> is — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.|$|E

40|$|Today, I {{have the}} {{pleasure}} of sharing a story with you about my experiences on a journey with young people from Chicago’s Cabrini Green neighborhood. The quintessential point of what I want you to walk away with here is that, for me, curriculum is not all about what state boards of education decide is {{important for us to}} do with children. <b>It’s</b> <b>certainly</b> not what a teacher is going to construct alone. <b>It’s</b> <b>certainly</b> not fixed or finite. It’s a journey of co-creation and looking to the students for what’s worth-while—what’s worth knowing, doing, being, becoming, thinking about, pondering, wonder-ing, and pondering some more (Schubert, 1986 / 1997). ...|$|R

25|$|In November 1939, {{his father}} was shot to death, most likely by Al Capone's gunmen. During Capone's tax evasion trial in 1931 and 1932, O'Hare's father had {{provided}} incriminating evidence which helped finally put Capone away. There is speculation that this was done to ensure that Butch got into the Naval Academy, or to set a good example; <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> at least partly involved an attempt {{to distance himself from}} Capone's activities. Whatever the motivation, the elder O'Hare was shot down in his car, a week before Capone was released from incarceration.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} the Anglican Church on the prairies had a profile, {{for better or worse}} and with greater or lesser legitimacy, of being {{somewhat}} exclusive.
