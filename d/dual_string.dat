We argue that the <b>dual</b> <b>string</b> equations (with a non-universal maximum velocity) should describe the large scale motion of narrow magnetic flux tubes, because of a large reparametrization (gauge) invariance of the magnetic and electric string fields.

40|$|In {{the paper}} hep-th/ 0504039, it was conjectured {{that in the}} context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the 1 / 2 -BPS {{point-like}} Wilson loop in the N = 4 SYM theory is mapped to the vacuum state of the <b>dual</b> IIB <b>string</b> theory on the pp wave background and the functional derivatives of the Wilson loop are mapped to the excited string states. Motivated by this conjecture, we consider the small deformation of the point-like Wilson loop in the 3 -dimensional N = 6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory. By Taylor expansion of the pointlike Wilson loop in powers of the loop variables, we obtain the BPS operators that correspond to the excited string states of the <b>dual</b> IIA <b>string</b> theory on the pp wave background.

40|$|Abstract. We review {{properties}} of lower-dimension vacuum defects observed in lattice simulations of SU(2) Yang-Mills theories. One- and two-dimensional defects {{are associated with}} ultraviolet divergent action. The action is the same divergent as in perturbation theory but the fluctuations extend over submanifolds of the whole 4 d space. The action is self tuned to a divergent entropy and the 2 d defects {{can be thought of}} as <b>dual</b> <b>strings</b> populated with particles. The newly emerging 3 d defects are closely related to the confinement mechanism. Namely, there is a kind of holography so that information on the confinement is encoded in a 3 d submanifold. We introduce an SU(2) invariant classification scheme which allows for a unified description of d = 1, 2, 3 defects. The scheme fits known data and predicts that 3 d defects are related to chiral symmetry breaking. Relation to stochastic vacuum model is briefly discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|The k-string {{tensions}} are explored in the 4 -d $[U(1) ]^{N- 1 }$-invariant dual Abelian-Higgs-type theory. In the London limit of this theory, the Casimir scaling {{is found in}} the approximation when small-sized closed <b>dual</b> <b>strings</b> are disregarded. When these strings are treated in the dilute-plasma approximation, explicit corrections to the Casimir scaling are found. The leading correction due to the deviation from the London limit is also derived. Its N-ality dependence {{turns out to be the}} same as that of the first non-trivial correction produced by closed strings. It also turns out that this N-ality dependence coincides with that of the leading correction to the k-string tension, which emerges by way of the non-diluteness of the monopole plasma in the 3 -d SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model. Finally, we prove that, in the latter model, Casimir scaling holds even at monopole densities close to the mean one, provided the string world sheet is flat.
