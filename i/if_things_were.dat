25|$|Against such methods the NVA/VC uses {{a variety}} of approaches. If the {{objective}} was to cause attrition, NVA regulars would sometimes fight directly with their opponents using conventional tactics, particularly on the DMZ against the US Marines, and in remote border areas near Laos and Cambodia. Such attrition objectives were sometimes part of the North's overall strategy of drawing the Americans into remote areas, and away from key population clusters dominated or contested by the Viet Cong. Some American postwar memoirs comment favorably on the bravery and tactical discipline of the NVA in these encounters. To stem an advance from airmobile enemies NVA troops sometimes held their ground in prepared fortifications, buying time for their comrades to maneuver elsewhere. PAVN forces also attempted with limited success to attack the quickly constructed firebases from which the lethal firepower issued. Gaps between maneuvering US units were infiltrated and attacks mounted. Ambushes were also executed. Another tactic was fighting close to US units, so close that deadly American artillery and air strikes were discouraged for fear of hitting their own troops. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going badly, PAVN forces withdrew to cross-border sanctuaries, where American ground forces were forbidden to follow. The fast-moving US operations, {{where there was no}} time for the usual months of communist initiative and rehearsed preparations, could catch PAVN off-guard, and casualties against US forces could be heavy. In Operation Dewey Canyon for example, US after-action reports claim some 1,617 NVA killed, for a loss of 121 marines killed, and the capture of hundreds of tons of munitions, equipment and supplies.|$|E
500|$|Although Pasteur {{had little}} idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, Joseph Meister (1876–1940), who {{was brought to}} Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. [...] Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he {{was well aware of}} the {{consequences}} for him <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10days. Later Pasteur wrote, [...] "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs". [...] Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog. Pasteur's method of treatment [...] remained in use for over 50years.|$|E
