5000|$|In {{addition}} to the total hemispherical emissivities compiled in the table above, a more complex [...] "directional spectral emissivity" [...] can also be measured. This emissivity depends upon the wavelength and upon {{the angle of the}} outgoing thermal radiation. Kirchhoff's law actually applies exactly to this more complex emissivity: the emissivity for thermal radiation emerging in a particular direction and at a particular wavelength matches the absorptivity for incident light at the same wavelength and angle. The total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> is a weighted average of this directional spectral emissivity; the average is described by textbooks on [...] "radiative heat transfer".|$|E

The <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> should be kept as small as possible (<[*] 0.2) to minimize the radiation losses.

A frequency-dependent free-carrier relaxation rate is {{found to have a}} similar magnitude for all these elements. For temperatures larger than 1200 K the calculated emissivity is always greater than the measured value, indicating that the high-temperature interband features of transition elements are much weaker than those determined from room-temperature measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The {{emissivity}} {{of a given}} {{surface is}} the measure {{of its ability to}} emit radiation energy in comparison to a blackbody at the same temperature. The emissivity of a surface varies between zero and one. The emissivity of a real surface varies {{as a function of the}} surface temperature, the wavelength, and the direction of the emitted radiation. The fundamental emissivity of a surface at a given temperature is the spectral directional emissivity, which is defined as the ratio of the intensity of radiation emitted by the surface at a specified wavelength and direction to that emitted by a blackbody under the same conditions. [...] The total directional emissivity is defined in the same fashion by using the total intensities integrated over all wavelengths. In practice, a more convenient method is used: hemispherical properties. These properties are spectrally and directionally averaged. The emissivity of a surface at a specified wavelength may vary as temperature changes since the spectral distribution of emitted radiation changes with temperature. Finally the total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> is defined in terms of the radiation energy emitted over all wavelengths in all directions. Radiation is a complex phenomenon. The dependability of its properties in wavelength and direction makes it even more complicated. Therefore, the gray and diffuse approximation methods are commonly used to perform radiation calculations. A gray surface is characterized by having properties independent of wavelength, and a diffuse surface has properties independent of direction.|$|E

Over the temperature range investigated (1350 less than T(sub m) less than 1825 K), the measured liquid density (in g/cc) can be expressed by a quadratic function, pi(P) = p(sub m) - 1. 69 x 10 (exp - 4) (T - T(sub m)) - 1. 75 x 10 (exp - 7) ((T - T(sub m)) (exp 2) with T(sub m) and p(sub m) being 1687 K and 2. 56 g/cc, respectively.

40|$|A {{description}} of the apparatus and methods used for obtaining total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> is presented, and data for several stably oxidized metals are included. The metals which were tested included type 347 stainless steel, tungsten, and Haynes alloys B, C, X, and 25. No values of emissivity were obtained for tungsten or Haynes alloy B {{because of the nature}} of the oxides produced. The refractory oxide coatings tested were flame-sprayed alumina and zirconia. The results of the investigation indicate that strongly adherent, oxidized surfaces of a high stable emissivity can be produced on type 347 stainless steel for which the total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> varied from 0. 87 to 0. 91 for temperatures from 600 F to 2, 000 F. For this same temperature range, the Haynes alloys tested showed values of total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> from 0. 90 to 0. 96 for alloy C, from 0. 85 to 0. 88 for alloy X, and from 0. 85 to 0. 89 for alloy 25. Haynes alloy B and tungsten formed nonadherent oxides at elevated temperatures and, therefore, stable emissivities were not obtained. The results obtained for the flame-sprayed ceramics (alumina and zirconia) showed considerably higher values of total emissivity than those measured for coatings applied by other methods. Emissivity values ranging from 0. 69 to 0. 44 for aluminum oxide and from 0. 62 to 0. 44 for zirconium oxide were measured for temperatures from 800 F to 2, 000 F...|$|E

40|$|Also {{from the}} {{comparison}} of the thick film solution with the "diffuse-gray " approximation [1], the ratio of thick film heat flux to "diffuse-gray " can be obtained for the two cases: rl = 15. 1 deg K, T 3 = 4. 5 deg K, and '/', = 10. 0 deg K, Tz = 4. 5 deg K. Since the measured heat flux should correspond to the thick film solution, the "diffuse-gray " heat flux is obtained by dividing the measured heat flux by the above ratio as shown in Table 4. From the "diffuse-gray " heat flux, an approximate value of the total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> is obtained. The order of magnitude of these values seems to be fairly consistent with the data reported by Betz [11] and Caren [6] in the liquid-nitrogen temperature range.

40|$|A new {{measurement}} technique for <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> and {{specific heat capacity}} of electrically-conducting materials at high temperatures using a feedback-controlled pulse-heating technique has been developed at NRLM (National Research Laboratory of Metrology) {{as a result of}} the cooperation with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) [1 - 3]. This technique is based on a quick resistive self-heating (about 200 ms) of a strip sample up to a preset high temperature, and then, keeping the sample at that temperature for a short time (about 500 ms) as illustrated in Figure 1. In this technique, a computer-controlled feedback system was employed to control the heating current. The sample temperature was measured using a high-speed radiation thermometer operating at 655 nm. The true temperature was decided from the normal spectral emissivity of the sample surface measured with a laser-ellipsometer at 675 nm [4]. The normal spectral emissivity was corrected to correspond to the wavelength of the radiation thermometer based on the emissivity results given at several wavelengths in the literature [5 - 8]. <b>Hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> and specific heat capacity of the sample were calculated from the measured quantities using the heat balance equations (1) and (2) based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Using the present technique, the <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> and specific heat capacity of the four refractory metals (niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten), were measured in the temperature range from about 1500 K to the temperature close to the melting point of each metal.

The ratio of cp/epsilon T {{as a function of}} undercooling was determining from radiative cooling curves measured in the HTHVESL. Using specific heat capacity data obtained by DSC investigations close to the glass transition and above the melting point, epsilon T and cp were separated and the specific heat capacity of the whole undercooled liquid region was determined. Furthermore, the <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> of the liquid was found to be about 0. 22 at 980 K.

These properties are density, thermal expansion coefficient, constant pressure heat capacity, <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity,</b> surface tension, and viscosity. For the first time, we report the densities and the thermal expansion coefficients of both the solid as well as liquid Zr over wide ranges of temperatures. Over the 1700 – 2300 K temperature span, the liquid density can be expressed as ρ_ 1 (T) = 6. 24 × 10 ^ 3 – 0. 29 (T – T_m) kg/m^ 3 with T_m = 2128 K, and the corresponding volume expansion coefficient as α_ 1 = 4. 6 × 10 ^(− 5) /K. Similarly, over the 1250 – 2100 K range, the measured density of the solid can be expressed as ρ_s(T) = 6. 34 × 10 ^ 3 – 0. 15 (T – T_m), giving a volume expansion coefficient α_s = 2. 35 × 10 ^(− 5) /K. The constant pressure heat capacity of the liquid phase could be estimated as C_(pl) (T) = 39. 72 – 7. 42 × 10 ^(− 3) (T – T_m) J/(mol/K) if the <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emissivity</b> of the liquid phase ε_(T 1) remains constant at 0. 3 over the 1825 – 2200 K range.

A clear trend was identified for the ratio of the 0. 6 – 2. 8 μm to the 0. 6 – 40 μm <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivity</b> (assumed to be close to the true α/ε ratio, which is the ratio of the solar absorptivity α to the total emissivity ε) {{as a function of the}} RMS roughness. This ratio is decreasing with increasing RMS roughness rapidly up to around 1 μm and then tends to stabilize for higher roughness. It suggests that increasing the roughness, starting from a flat surface, will progressively give more weight to the long wavelength range emissivities in comparison to the short wavelength ones. Beside the RMS roughness, a sharp surface structure on a finer scale found on some samples also led to an additional decrease of the α/ε ratio, but these structures are not stable at high temperature and disappear due to a natural high temperature smoothing. Finally our results also show that the α/ε ratio of rhenium is lower than the one of tungsten...|$|E
40|$|We analyze far-infrared (10 - 650 cm^- 1) {{emissivity}} {{spectra of}} Saturn's main rings {{obtained by the}} Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). In modeling of the spectra, the single scattering albedos of regolith grains are calculated using the Mie theory, diffraction is removed with the delta-Eddington approximation, and the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emissivities</b> of macroscopic free-floating ring particles are calculated using the Hapke's isotropic scattering model. Only pure crystalline water ice is considered and the size distribution of regolith grains is estimated. We find that good fits are obtained if the size distribution is broad ranging from 1 μm to 1 - 10 cm with a power law index of ∼ 3. This means that the largest regolith grains are comparable to the smallest free-floating particles in size and that the power law indices for both free-floating particles and regolith grains are similar to each other. The apparent relative abundance of small grains increases with decreasing solar phase angle (or increasing mean temperature). This trend is particularly strong for the C ring and is probably caused by eclipse cooling in Saturn's shadow, which relatively suppresses warming up of grains larger than the thermal skin depth (∼ 1 mm) under subsequent solar illumination.
