According {{to the single}} crystal data the CU 2 + ion is pentacoordinated and located in a slightly distorted square pyramidal configuration. Four short Cu-N bonds to two N(7) of the theophyllinate anions and to two nitrogen atoms of a monodentate and a bidentate 2 -aminoethanol ligands are almost in the plane, while a longer Cu-O bond to oxygen of the bidentate 2 -aminoethanol in the apex at distance 2. 350 (8) Angstrom A.

These <b>evolved</b> <b>gas</b> <b>detections</b> indicate nitrates, organics, oxychlorine phase, and sulfates are widespread with phyllosilicates and carbonates occurring in select Gale Crater materials. Coevolved CO 2 (160 ± 248 - 2373 ± 820 μgC (CO 2) /g), and CO (11 ± 3 - 320 ± 130 μgC (CO) /g) suggest organic-C {{is present in}} Gale Crater materials. Five samples evolved CO 2 at temperatures consistent with carbonate (0. 32 ± 0. 05 - 0. 70 ± 0. 1 wt. % CO 3). Evolved NO amounts to 0. 002 ± 0. 007 - 0. 06 ± 0. 03 wt. % NO 3. Evolution of O 2 suggests oxychlorine phases (chlorate/perchlorate) (0. 05 ± 0. 025 - 1. 05 ± 0. 44 wt. % ClO 4) are present while SO 2 evolution indicates the presence of crystalline and/or poorly crystalline Fe- and Mg-sulfate and possibly sulfide. Evolved H 2 O (0. 9 ± 0. 3 - 2. 5 ± 1. 6 wt. % H 2 O) {{is consistent with the}} presence of adsorbed water, hydrated salts, interlayer/structural water from phyllosilicates, and possible inclusion water in mineral/amorphous phases. Evolved H 2 and H 2 S suggest reduced phases occur despite the presence of oxidized phases (nitrate, oxychlorine, sulfate, carbonate). SAM results coupled with CheMin mineralogical and APXS elemental analyses indicate that Gale Crater sedimentary rocks have experienced a complex authigenetic/diagenetic history involving fluids with varying pH, redox, and salt composition.

The gas sensors of the detection modules are classified two types. One is competitiveness <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> module, and uses the same sensors to detect gas leakage. The other is complementation <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> module, and uses variety sensors to classify multiple gases.

In our series of theophyllinato copper(II) complexes containing amine ligands, the structural effect of changing from ethanolamine to diethanolamine is examined. A new mixed ligand copper(II) complex, bis(mu- 2 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) aminoethanolato-O,N,O') bis(theophyllinato-N 7) dicopper(II) (C 22 H 34 N 10 O 8 Cu 2) (1) has been synthesized as model compound from aqueous solutions of CuSO 4, theophylline, and diethanolamine (dea). Its distinct Me 2 L 2 L'(2) structure has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The centrosymmetric binuclear complex contains two strongly distorted square pyramidally (or pseudo-octahedrally) coordinated copper ions bound together by two alkoxo-bridges. The bridging O is a deprotonated oxygen of the monoalcoholate formed from diethanolamine. Both of the theophyllinate anions take part in N 7 /O 6 chelation in the complex 1, while {{only one of the}} theophyllinate anions is able to perform it in the mononuclear complex (SPY- 5 - 12) -(2 -aminoethanol-N) (2 -aminoethanol-N,O) bis(theophyllinato-N 7) copper(II) dihydrate(2). The two copper(II) centres in 1 are found to be antiferromagnetically coupled. The combined thermogravimetric and <b>evolved</b> <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> shows that the tridentate alcoholate anions are fragmented and evolved between 125 and 275 degrees C, whilst the degradation of theophyllinate anions begins at 350 degrees C.
