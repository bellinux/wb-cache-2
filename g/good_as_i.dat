25|$|Dylan's last {{album of}} {{original}} material had been 1990's Under the Red Sky, a critical and commercial disappointment. Since then, he had released two albums <b>Good</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Been To You and World Gone Wrong of folk covers and MTV Unplugged, a live album of older compositions; {{there had been}} no signs of any fresh compositions until 1996.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Dylan {{returned}} to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers: <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song [...] "Lone Pilgrim", written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits. The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included [...] "John Brown", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.|$|E
500|$|On April 25, 2009, Pujols {{picked up}} his 1,000th career RBI with a 441-foot grand slam against David Patton in an 8–2 victory over the Cubs. [...] "I hit that ball as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can hit a ball", he said after the game. On July 3, he hit his 10th career grand slam against Weathers in a 7–4 victory over the Reds, {{breaking}} Musial's record for most grand slams by a Cardinal. The grand slam was also his 350th career home run, making him the third-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey, Jr.. He received {{the highest number of}} votes in NL history for the All-Star Game that year.|$|E

500|$|Northwestern's longest gain was six yards. The only {{threat to}} Michigan's goal {{came in the}} second half when Willie Heston fielded a kickoff and tossed to Everett Sweeley. Northwestern took over at the ten-yard line and moved it by the [...] "tandem play" [...] to the two-yard line. [...] Yost later {{recalled}} the impressive play of his team in preventing Northwestern to score: [...] "The defense at this point was as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen. Northwestern could not advance a foot. When the ball was held for downs and Michigan had again obtained possession, our goal line had passed its only danger of the season." [...] The Pittsburgh Press described the game as follows: [...] "Just to show her superiority during the last few minutes of play, Michigan, put in an all substitute line. The Michigan defence was impregnable and her offensive work grand." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could have ever wished for." ...|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in London, the pastels sold {{particularly}} well and he quipped, [...] "They {{are not as}} <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> supposed. They are selling!" [...] He was actively engaged in exhibiting his other work but with limited success. Though still struggling financially, however, he was heartened by the attention and admiration he received from the younger generation of English and American painters who made him their idol and eagerly adopted the title [...] "pupil of Whistler". Many of them returned to America and spread tales of Whistler's provocative egotism, sharp wit, and aesthetic pronouncements—establishing the legend of Whistler, much to his great satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30 Marquis {{pitched a}} 2-hit, 0-walk, 17-ground-ball-outs, 86-pitch shutout {{to become the}} first 10-game winner in the NL. A {{reporter}} for MLB.com called it [...] "one of the best pitching performances in Rockies history", and Rob Neyer of ESPN described Marquis that night as [...] "Bob Gibson, Orel Hershiser, and Greg Maddux all rolled into one". [...] He beat the LA Dodgers, which had {{the best record in the}} major leagues, and outpitched their ace Chad Billingsley 3–0 in a matchup of pitchers leading the league in wins. It was his third career shutout, and his second complete game of the season. He also drove in two of his team's three runs. [...] "That was something special, as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have seen in my 7½years behind this desk", said Rockies manager Jim Tracy.|$|E

2500|$|They both {{survive the}} crash, and despite being urged {{to back off}} by various other characters, Ziva {{ultimately}} kills Bodnar in the following episode. This leads to DOD investigator Richard Parsons (Colin Hanks) initiating a witch hunt against the team and Ziva being aggressively interrogated about her conduct {{in the aftermath of}} her father's death. When he accuses her of sleeping with an old friend while in Israel, Tony, who had been viewing the interrogation from the observation room, abruptly ends it and forces Parsons out. When he approaches Ziva about the accusation, she admits that it was a [...] "moment of weakness" [...] because she felt alone. This obviously hurts Tony, and he says, [...] "My Hebrew must not be as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> thought because I could've sworn when I dropped you off at the airport, I told you you are not alone". Ziva recalls this, and Tony says that they must have different interpretations before walking away. Despite this, he later confronts Parsons, demanding that Ziva be left alone and calling her his best friend.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2005, Keith {{founded a}} new label, Show Dog Nashville. Its first release was his 2006 album White Trash with Money, {{followed}} by the soundtrack to Broken Bridges. He also abandoned Stroud as co-producer in favor of Cannon's wife, Lari White. The album included three singles: [...] "Get Drunk and Be Somebody", [...] "A Little Too Late", and [...] "Crash Here Tonight". Big Dog Daddy followed in 2007, with Keith serving as sole producer. Its singles were [...] "High Maintenance Woman", [...] "Love Me If You Can", and [...] "Get My Drink On". [...] "Love Me If You Can" [...] became Keith's first number 1 hit since [...] "As <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Once Was" [...] {{more than two years}} prior. A two-disc Christmas album, A Classic Christmas, followed later in 2007. In 2008, Keith completed his Biggest and Baddest Tour. On May 6, 2008, he released 35 Biggest Hits, a two-disc compilation featuring most of his singles to date, as well as the new song [...] "She's a Hottie", which peaked at number 13.|$|E
2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. It was sad {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any <b>good,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wanted them to be and to be honest, I did feel sad about that for a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), {{the body}} that {{develops}} Canada's national list of endangered species, assessed Atlantic Cod. COSEWIC's designations in theory are informed by reports it commissions and expert discussion in the panel, and it claims to be scientific and apolitical. Recognising faults in processes is not recreational, but {{an important step in}} their improvement. In this case much was mishandled. One observer opined [...] "this process stinks"; the same observer later joined, and then became Chair of, COSEWIC. COSEWIC listed Atlantic cod as [...] "vulnerable" [...] (this category later renamed [...] "special concern") on a single-unit basis, i.e. assuming a single homogeneous population. The basis (single-unit) of designation and the level (vulnerable) assigned was in contrast to the range of designations including [...] "endangered" [...] for some of the 10 management (sub) units addressed in the report that COSEWIC had commissioned from Dr. K.N.I. Bell. That contradiction between the report and the listing reflected political pressure from the DFO; such bureaucratic pressure had been evident through three years of drafts. The 1998 designation followed on from a deferral in 1997 and bureaucratic tactics including what one COSEWIC insider characterised as [...] "a plan to make it late". Press interest prior to the 1998 meeting had, however, likely deterred a further deferral. COSEWIC's 'single unit' basis of listing was at the behest of DFO, despite that DFO itself had previously in criticism demanded (properly, given the new evidence) that the report address multiple stocks. The author had agreed with that criticism and revised accordingly, but DFO then changed its mind without explanation. By the time of COSEWIC's 1998 cod discussion, the Chair had been ousted for having said [...] "I have seen a lot of status reports ... t is as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen in regards to content", and COSEWIC had already attempted to unilaterally alter the 1998 report. The report remains one of an undeclared number that are illegally suppressed (COSEWIC refuses to officially release it unless it can change it [...] "so that it ... reflects COSEWIC's designation"), in this case despite kudos from eminent reviewers of COSEWIC's own choice. COSEWIC in defense asserted a right to alter the report or that Bell had been asked to provide a report that supported COSEWIC's designation; either defense would involve clear violations of ethics, of COSEWIC's procedures at the time, and of the norms of science. The key tactics used to avert any at-risk listing centered on the issue of stock discreteness, and DFO's single-stock stance within COSEWIC contradicted the multiple-stock hypothesis supported by the most recent science (including DFO's, hence DFO's earlier and proper demand that the report address these). Bell has argued that this contradiction between fact and tactic effectively painted management into a corner from which it could not acknowledge or explain the contrast between areas where conservation measures were clearly needed and areas where opposite observations were gaining press attention. In effect, DFO's opposition to a listing compromised its ability to carry out its conservation mandate.|$|E
