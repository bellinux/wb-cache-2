5|$|Willis {{continued}} to <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> form with the bat with 33* against Nottinghamshire in {{the interval between}} the fifth and final Tests, though he went wicketless. On 27 August, Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval. The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border, while Willis took four wickets and Botham six. A century from Boycott then defied Lillee's seven wicket haul to take England to 314, and in reply Hendrick and Botham took four wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis went without a wicket in the second innings. With half-centuries from Gatting and Brearley, England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw. England were victorious in the series 3:1, and Botham's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as 'Botham's Ashes'.|$|E
5|$|Henry campaigned {{throughout}} the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to Lyons-la-Forêt in November to <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> hunting, still apparently healthy. There Henry fell ill– {{according to the}} chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, he ate a number of lampreys against his physician's advice– and his condition worsened {{over the course of}} a week. Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop Hugh of Amiens, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture. The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at Port-du-Salut Abbey, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.|$|E

25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals. They {{argue that the}} chase itself causes fear and {{distress}} and that the fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, {{on the grounds that}} animals should <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).|$|E
25|$|Bayern did <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> {{measure of}} success outside of regular league play. They {{captured}} the 1957 German Cup, just their second national trophy, on a 78th-minute goal by Rudi Jobst against Fortuna Düsseldorf. 16 October 1962 marked the debut of the club on the European scene. In the opening round of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup they beat Basel (3–0), but then {{went out in the}} quarter-finals against eventual finalist Dinamo Zagreb (1–4) and (0–0).|$|E
25|$|The general {{result of}} the {{investigation}} has been to disclose the existence of numerous and flagrant discriminations by the railroads in behalf of the Standard Oil Co. and its affiliated corporations. With comparatively few exceptions, mainly of other large concerns in California, the Standard has been the sole beneficiary of such discriminations. In almost every section {{of the country that}} company has been found to <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> unfair advantages over its competitors, and some of these discriminations affect enormous areas.|$|E

The sport's profile is highest during the Commonwealth Games, when British swimmers have their best chance to win gold medals, and during the Olympics.

25|$|It {{would seem}} {{that it was a}} {{pleasant}} day out for a couple of the canons or friars of Wells to hire horses and ride over to talk business with Denys, perhaps an excuse to <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> all-expenses paid entertainment. It appears that Denys held the farm until his death in 1422, although records are not available to confirm this. A cadet branch of the Denys family became lords of the manor of Pucklechurch, probably in the 16th century, and continuing until the death of William Dennis in 1701, last of the male line.|$|E

The major surge in its popularity has come mainly {{within the past}} decade {{with the success of}} its native skaters, but there have been avid fans in the country for international skaters for much longer. Skater Dorothy Hamill is known to have received pearls from the Japanese royal family in the 1970s. Figure Skaters in Japan also <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> level of celebrity—some like Mao Asada and Yuzuru Hanyu (the first Japanese male figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal) becoming household names and gaining large sponsorships. The NHK Trophy, a major figure skating Grand-Prix event, is hosted in Japan every year.|$|E

25|$|At {{its height}} from the 1860s until 1914, the fixture was a prestigious one, though {{in terms of}} quality it fell far short of Test matches and even of the rival North v. South fixture. Until the 1860s, the Gentlemen teams were often very weak {{compared}} with the professionals, and on occasion the fixture had to be arranged on an odds basis, so that the Players eleven took on {{a greater number of}} Gentlemen. The Gentlemen famously became competitive during the career of W. G. Grace, whose performances were so outstanding that the Gentlemen could <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> long-awaited success. The fixture often confirmed the commonly held view of an imbalance between amateur and professional in that amateurs tended to be batsmen first and foremost, hence there were few good amateur bowlers. The Players could nearly always field a strong bowling side.|$|E
25|$|Arab-plan or {{hypostyle}} mosques are {{the earliest}} type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques are square or rectangular in plan with an enclosed courtyard and a covered prayer hall. Historically, {{because of the}} warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate {{the large number of}} worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques have flat roofs on top of prayer halls, necessitating the use of numerous columns and supports. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Mezquita in Córdoba, Spain, as the building is supported by over 850 columns. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades so that visitors can <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, and as a result, these mosques gradually fell out of popularity.|$|E

In the now long-destroyed United States, several Californian theocratic city states <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> independence by playing the Raj off against Dai-Nippon, and regions near the Gulf of Mexico are inhabited by the Seven Tribes, relatively civilized peoples who are loosely allied with the Raj. Other semi-civilised powers in North America include the Kaijun, Cherokee, Kumanch, and Mehk tribes, as well as a small Mormon enclave near the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

Her character, Barbara Newman, is a sexually {{aggressive}} woman unwilling to let a co-worker <b>enjoy</b> <b>some</b> alone time. In 2009, she completed work on her first feature film, Necrosis, which was released internationally as Blood Snow. Necrosis was a psychological thriller in which she starred alongside James Kyson Lee and George Stults. In the film, she acted out the role of Karen, a fun-loving adrenaline junkie who took matters into her own hands after a blizzard had trapped her friends and her in a cabin, and paranoia {{got the best of}} them. Necrosis premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Tiffany's former music rival, Debbie Gibson, had her film Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus premiere at Cannes, as well. Tiffany also starred in a film from The Asylum, the mockbuster Mega Piranha, directed by Eric Forsberg, which also starred Barry Williams. Mega Piranha was the highest-rated SyFy movie of 2011.|$|E
