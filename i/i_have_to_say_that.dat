2500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Detroit News, when asked {{what it was like}} being CEO in a [...] "testosterone-charged industry", McMahon replied, [...] "It's lots of fun. I'm an only child, so I grew up as my father's son and mother's daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. I really have a very good understanding of the male psyche—I'm very comfortable in a guy environment. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there are very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It's still a testosterone business, and I like it." ...|$|E

In another letter, Waitrose's managing director Mark Price stated, [...] "a dairy farm of the size proposed would not fit with the Waitrose way of doing business, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am anxious that it represents the first step along the way towards a highly-industrialised, US approach to farming". [...] On 17 November 2010, Marks & Spencer declared, [...] "M does not buy milk from 'super-dairy' farms and we are committed to our current pool of dedicated dairy farms." [...] Jason Gissing, co-founder of Ocado, said in a letter published on the Ocado web site in December 2010, [...] "Rest assured, Ocado will not be milking it with Nocton.".|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} moments when I wonder — moments when its two senior networks, first set up as a partnership, {{schedule}} simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network. Then there are times when both BBC One and BBC Two, intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre, allow that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules. The result is that other kinds of programmes are not placed, simply {{because of a lack of}} space. Do we really require so many gardening programmes, make-over programmes or celebrity chefs? Is it not a scandal in this day and age, that there seems to be no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or thoughtful in-depth interviews with people other than politicians? ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you look at it in the cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I think back to Cantona and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I can understand how Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E
