The term “stereotype ” is seldom encountered in the sociological or economical papers dealing with farmer, farming and agriculture. There are existing dif-ferences of characteristics of stereotypes therefore article will try to detect features described by W. Lipmann, R. <b>Dyer,</b> <b>S.</b> Oskamp, R. W. Schultz and others. Some of the definitions offer thought that stereotypes are oversimplifications or generalizations while they are more complicated as it seems from the first sight. The current article will discover sociological concern of how stereotypes func-tion in social thought and the specific concerns how stereotypes function in urban youth thoughts. Article will distinguish negative, neutral and positive stereotypes.

40|$|Trust may be {{considered}} a risk moderator in choice under uncertainty and may help people to follow courses of action otherwise too risky to be undertaken. This hypothesis has been tested following a two-step research design. Results confirm the different role of cognitive and affective trust as risk moderators depending on {{the complexity of the}} task to perform. LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES Many scholars agree on the role played by a limited number of strategic relationships in order to achieve and maintain competitive advantages in domestic and international markets (Diericks, Cool, 1989; Morgan, Hunt, 1999; <b>Dyer,</b> <b>Sing,</b> 1996) and underline the critical role of trust in implementing lasting relationships among economic actors (Morgan, Hunt, 1994; Hakansson, Snehota, 1995). Indeed, these relationships require highly specific learning processes and idiosyncratic investments that will appear risky unless high commitment of participants, collaborative climate and trust reduce the chance of failure (Geyskens, Steenkamp, Kumar, 1998; Jap, 1999). Regarding trust, a number of topics are often debated in the marketing literature: the interpersonal...|$|R
40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by external measurement. This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.

40|$|The {{provision}} of care is an increasingly pressing {{issue in the}} Global North. With an ageing population and policies encouraging women into the labour market, {{there is a growing}} need for workers to undertake paid caring. This poses important and urgent questions about the social organisation of labour markets. Care work typically is low paid and undertaken in precarious, informal, or temporary situations. Many posts are filled by economic migrants, raising concerns about a care deficit in sending countries. In this paper we examine the 'caring work' undertaken by migrant workers in a West London hospital. We employ a twofold characterisation of caring work. Like other bottom-end service sector work, this work is characterised by the face-to-face 'emotional labour'. However, it also requires 'body work': close and often intimate physical contact between carers and those they care for. We argue that both of these aspects are important in understanding how caring work is constructed as poorly regarded and low paid. We show how these features play out in particular ways for migrant workers employed in such caring work.
