Results from {{an online}} expert consultation. <b>JRC</b> 60869 <b>Technical</b> <b>Note.</b> Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. This report synthesizes the {{findings}} of a series of four online consultations which were conducted as part of the study “The Future of Learning: New Ways to Learn New Skills for Future Jobs”. The findings suggest that, while the existing physical and formal structures of education and training will remain intact, schools and universities will change significantly with respect to pedagogical strategies. Learning and teaching processes will be more flexible in addressing and implementing individual needs and preferences. Teachers will become mentors and guides in self-regulated, personalised and collaborative learning processes. Schools as institutions will open up to society by integrating external learning resources and practical learning opportunities. Technology will assist learning institutions in facilitating both, personalisation and institutional flexibility. Furthermore, all citizens will have to continuously update and develop their skills; assume responsibility for their qualifications and pro-actively develop their professional career. While attaining formal qualifications will remain key for grasping new employment opportunities, informally acquired skills will be better recognised and mechanisms will be put in place that will allow people to obtain formal recognition for their professional expertise, by upgrading their skills with adequate and targeted training.
