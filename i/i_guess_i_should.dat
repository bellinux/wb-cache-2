Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{try to do what}} I should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, as the second-string quarterback, he saw {{his first}} action against [...] when he was {{substituted}} for injured starter Jordan Steffy. Turner executed a scoring drive and completed four of six passes, but also threw two interceptions. He sat out the next two games and then took one snap against Wake Forest. When the unranked Terps faced 10th-ranked Rutgers, Steffy suffered a concussion and Turner again filled in. He led drives for two touchdowns and two field goals in an upset of the Scarlet Knights, 34–24. About the then relatively unknown Turner, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano said, [...] "I wish I would have seen this guy before." [...] Turner started for the remaining eight games of the season. In his career-first start, he passed for 255yards in a win against Georgia Tech, 28–26. In the game, he threw a 78-yard touchdown pass, which was caught by tight end Jason Goode rather than his intended receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a three-game losing streak, Turner led another upset win over a top-ten team, this time against eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. In the 24–16 loss to Florida State, Turner had his worst performance of the season. Late in the second quarter, he was benched and replaced by Steffy for two possessions. Turner said, [...] "I didn't know that my leash was that short in the first place, to be honest. I didn't think {{it would come to}} this. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have." [...] After an uneven performance by Steffy, Turner played the entire second half and showed improvement. The following week Maryland played their regular season finale against NC State and both teams needed an additional win to attain bowl eligibility. Maryland led in the second quarter, 3–0, but was struggling offensively. Turner, a generally immobile pocket quarterback, invigorated the offense when he executed a 41-yard option run for a first down. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 206 yards and led a shutout of NC State, 37–0. With the sixth win, Maryland was invited to the Emerald Bowl, where they were beaten by Oregon State, 21–14. Turner finished the season as the third-most efficient passer in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).|$|E

2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City. The Stacks were active in their community, as their apartment was a hospitable place that was likened to [...] "a stop for tenants and neighborhood people seeking assistance or advice." [...] It was with his parents that Stack first began {{to participate in the}} practice of providing turkeys and holiday gifts to the needy, a practice that Stack would later institute as Mayor As Stack explained to a reporter when he was 19, [...] "I remember when I was about 6 or 7 years old being at the Doric Temple polling place on election day just sitting and listening to the local politicians. I would probably say I dedicated my high school years to politics when <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been more into school activities. My classmates would call me 'mayor'.

If <b>I</b> may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{say that there is}} no finer part in the Island than from this Place to Steephill. I do not {{hesitate}} to say it is fine. Bonchurch is the best. But I have been so many finer walks, with a background of lake and mountain instead of the sea, that I am not much touch'd with it, though I credit it for all the Surprise <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have felt if it had taken my cockney maidenhead. But I may call myself an old Stager in the picturesque, and unless it be something very large and overpowering, I cannot receive any extraordinary relish.|$|R

You're {{a smoker}} yourself, if I {{remember}} right, and you'll guess {{what it is}} to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away." [...] He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. [...] "I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. <b>I</b> never <b>guessed</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> meet you.

6000|$|But {{you will}} ask, [...] "If {{that is not}} the reason why fire burns, what is?" [...] My dear child, I do not know. That is Lady Why's business, who is {{mistress}} of Mrs. How, and of you and of me; and, as I think, of all things that you ever saw, or can see, or even dream. And what her reason for making fire burn may be I cannot tell. But I believe on excellent grounds that her reason is a very good one. If <b>I</b> dare to <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say that one reason, at least, why fire burns, is that you may take care not to play with it, and so not only scorch your finger, but set your whole bed on fire, and perhaps the house into the bargain, as you might be tempted to do if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting sugar in your mouth.|$|R

6000|$|Well, it {{was this}} {{business}} of the burglar that drew his attention to me; for he patted me on my head, and said that I was a spunky little devil, which blew me out with pride for a week on end. For two years we were close friends, for all the gap that the years had made between us, and though in passion or in want of thought he did many a thing that galled me, yet I loved him like a brother, and wept as much as would have filled an ink bottle when at last {{he went off to}} Edinburgh to study his father's profession. Five years after that did I tide at Birtwhistle's, and when I left had become cock myself, for I was wiry and as tough as whalebone, though I never ran to weight and sinew like my great predecessor. It was in Jubilee Year that I left Birtwhistle's, and then for three years I stayed at home learning the ways of the cattle; but still the ships and the armies were wrestling, and still the great shadow of Bonaparte lay across the country.

6000|$|I {{was feeling}} blithe, almost jocund. I put {{a match to}} my cigar, and just then the morning's mail was handed in. The first superscription I glanced at was in a {{handwriting}} that sent a thrill of pleasure through and through me. It was Aunt Mary's; {{and she was the}} person I loved and honored most in all the world, outside of my own household. She had been my boyhood's idol; maturity, which is fatal to so many enchantments, {{had not been able to}} dislodge her from her pedestal; no, it had only justified her right to be there, and placed her dethronement permanently among the impossibilities. To show how strong her influence over me was, I will observe that long after everybody else's [...] "do-stop-smoking" [...] had ceased to affect me in the slightest degree, Aunt Mary could still stir my torpid conscience into faint signs of life when she touched upon the matter. But all things have their limit in this world. A happy day came at last, when even Aunt Mary's words could no longer move me. I was not merely glad to see that day arrive; I was more than glad--I was grateful; for when its sun had set, the one alloy that was able to mar my enjoyment of my aunt's society was gone. The remainder of her stay with us that winter was in every way a delight. Of course she pleaded with me just as earnestly as ever, after that blessed day, to quit my pernicious habit, but to no purpose whatever; the moment she opened the subject I at once became calmly, peacefully, contentedly indifferent--absolutely, adamantinely indifferent. Consequently the closing weeks of that memorable visit melted away as pleasantly as a dream, they were so freighted for me with tranquil satisfaction. I could not have enjoyed my pet vice more if my gentle tormentor had been a smoker herself, and an advocate of the practice. Well, the sight of her handwriting reminded me that I way getting very hungry to see her again. <b>I</b> easily <b>guessed</b> what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find in her letter. I opened it. Good! just as I expected; she was coming! Coming this very day, too, and by the morning train; I might expect her any moment.|$|R

People wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm {{going to try and}} be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do better. May we try this way?" ...|$|E
