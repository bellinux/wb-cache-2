To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the outward journey towards the termites, all ants are laying a pheromone trail, making it much easier <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E

25|$|A sub plot is {{also shown}} to the reader in Sins of the Star Sapphire which {{introduces}} a key {{member of the new}} Corps. In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of Mother Mercy's vines after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008). Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their temporary partnership they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.|$|E
25|$|By 16:50 it was {{apparent}} to Smith that he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength. Yet with his two forward platoons still separated and unable to support each other, D Company was badly positioned for a defensive battle. 10 Platoon had been prevented from engaging the Viet Cong attacking 11 Platoon, {{and was unable to}} support its withdrawal. Meanwhile, 11 Platoon had gone to ground in extended line following the initial contact, leaving its flanks vulnerable, while its aggressive push forward prior to the engagement also complicated the application of artillery support, which had to be switched to support each platoon as required rather than allowing it to be concentrated. Unable to see either platoon, the D Company forward observer was unsure of 11 Platoon's exact position, further delaying the process. As a consequence 10 and 11 Platoons were each forced to fight their own battles, and despite the weight of the indirect fire increasingly becoming available to support the Australian infantry, the Viet Cong were able to apply superior fire power as they tried to isolate and attack each platoon in turn. To retrieve the situation Smith planned to pull his company into an all-round defensive position to enable his platoons to support each other and fight a co-ordinated battle, and care for the wounded until a relief force could arrive to assist. Seemingly intent on attacking Nui Dat, the Viet Cong moved to overrun the beleaguered force, but the dispersal of the Australian platoons made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> D Company's flanks and roll them up, and may have led the Viet Cong commander to believe he was engaging a much larger Australian force.|$|E
500|$|On 1 November 1990, Geoffrey Howe, {{the last}} {{remaining}} member of Thatcher's original 1979 cabinet, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister over her refusal {{to agree to a}} timetable for Britain to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. In his resignation speech on 13 November, Howe commented on Thatcher's European stance: [...] "It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the moment that the first balls are bowled that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain."

[...] Unknown to Nolan he would not see these men until August 9 {{and he would never}} see Tafoya or his horse again. After dark Nolan pressed the men another nine miles (14km) before stopping for the night near a mound called [...] "Nigger Hill." [...] Today it is located in Roosevelt County, New Mexico about a mile west of the Texas border. Nolan could hear men down the trail and thinking they were lost fired shots into the air <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> camp. [...] Some straggled into camp. Sergeant Umbles, the former First sergeant, was still out in the dark with two sick men. Captain Nolan then had the bugler, also named Nolan, to take a horse and to find and return the men to camp. Those four men never returned. Nolan would charge them with desertion upon his return.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, the Government {{requested}} {{approval from}} President S. R. Nathan to draw $4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, {{the first time}} it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the financial downturn: the Jobs Credit scheme, which provided employers with financial assistance to pay employees' salaries; and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative, which helped mid-sized companies to obtain credit. The President gave in-principle approval 11 days later on 21 January. During this time, the Government briefed him and the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA), and the CPA considered the request and provided the President with its recommendation. Subsequently, at a press conference on 17 February, the President explained that when the Prime Minister had broached the subject informally on 10 January, he had agreed at that stage to give every consideration to the proposal as he and the CPA were already aware of the prevailing financial crisis and how it was impacting the country. He commented that he was not an Executive President and that the Executive was really the Government. It was <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> solutions to the nation's problems and come out with proposals: [...] "As to whether the proposals were right or wrong, we don't micro-manage Government.

40|$|Malware analysts {{still need}} to {{manually}} inspect malware samples that are considered suspicious by heuristic rules. They dissect software pieces and look for malware evidence in the code. The increasing number of malicious applications targeting Android devices raises the demand <b>for</b> analyzing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> where the malcode is triggered when user interacts with them. In this paper a framework to monitor and visualize Android applications’ anomalous function calls is described. Our approach includes platform-independent application instrumentation, introducing hooks in order to trace restricted API functions used at runtime of the application. These function calls are collected at a central server where the application behavior filtering and a visualization take place. This can help Android malware analysts in visually inspecting what the application under study does, easily identifying such malicious functions...|$|R
2500|$|In 1917, the United States entered World War I {{and that}} same year the United States Congress {{approved}} the Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans no longer needed a passport {{to travel to the}} U.S. and were allowed to seek public office in the mainland U.S. The economic situation in the island was bad and continued to worsen {{as a result of the}} many hurricanes which destroyed most of its crops. Many Puerto Rican families migrated to the United States, the bulk of whom went to New York, in search of a better way of life. In New York, they faced the same hardships and discrimination that earlier groups of immigrants, such as the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews, had faced before them. It was difficult <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> well paying jobs because of the language barrier and their lack of technical working skills. [...] The few men who found jobs worked for low salaries in factories. [...] The women usually stayed home as housewives and tended to their children. Those who did not find jobs had the option of joining the United States Military. Prior to the Jones-Shafroth Act, Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States as all other non-citizens, who were permanent residents were required to register with the Selective Service System by law and could be drafted, however one of the effects of the Act was that all Puerto Ricans were now eligible for the military [...] "draft" [...] (conscription). One of the military units at that time was New York's U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment. Rafael Hernández was a Puerto Rican who served in the almost all Afro-American unit.
