5|$|Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by English rock band Oasis, {{released}} on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe and 1995 follow up (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, {{were aware of}} the dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. The tactics resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day of release, Be Here Now sold over 424,000 copies, {{becoming}} the fastest-selling album in British chart history, while initial reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Retrospectively, however, the album is viewed by many music journalists and fans and by most members of the band as over-indulgent and bloated. Q magazine, which gave the album a five-star review on its release, admitted in 2007 that Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> <b>is</b> often thought of as [...] "a disastrous, overblown follyâ€”the moment when Oasis, their judgement clouded by drugs and blanket adulation, ran aground on their own sky-high self-belief." [...] The album's producer Owen Morris said the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and that the band's only motivations were commercial. As of 2008, the album had sold eight million copies worldwide.|$|E

"I don't know, I don't know," [...] {{returned}} the old man, perplexed, [...] "there's so many marks {{of all sorts}} to go by, {{it makes it a}} kind of uncertain. <b>Here,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> this bill," [...] touching one, [...] "it looks to be a three dollar bill on the Vicksburgh Trust and Insurance Banking Company.

Now the contrivance and execution of such plans is a source of positive pleasure; it is always pleasant to bring the properties and powers of matter into requisition to promote our designs,--but there is a far higher pleasure in controlling, and guiding, and moulding to our purpose the movements of mind.|$|E

[...] "We are always puffing our own progress in America, without exactly knowing whether {{a good deal of the}} road is not to be traveled over again, by way of undoing much that we have done. <b>Here,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> a specimen of our march in folly, in an advertisement of Bobbinett's, who has pocket-handkerchiefs at $75." ...|$|E

The Home Government is taking it in hand; horses willing, if a thought unskilful.

Karl Albert, being joined {{some days}} ago at Scharding {{by the first}} three French Divisions, 15,000 men in all (the other four Divisions {{of them are still}} in the Donauworth-Ingolstadt quarter, making their {{manifold}} arrangements), has pushed forward, sixty miles (land-marches, south side of the Donau, which makes a bend here), and this day, September 14th, appears at Linz. Pleasant City of Linz; where, as readers may remember, Mr. John Kepler, long ago, busy discovering the System of the World (grandest Conquest ever made, or to be made, by the Sons of Adam), had his poor CAMERA OBSCURA set out, to get himself a livelihood in the interim: <b>here</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> Karl Albert's flag on the winds, and, as it were, the Oriflamme with it, on a singularly different Adventure.

(2 Sam 13, 14:32,33) Also, Joab durst not go upon that errand himself, but by the mediation of another. Sin is a fearful thing, it will quash and quail the courage of a man, and make him afraid to approach {{the presence}} of him whom he has offended, though the offended is but a man. How much more, then, shall it discourage a man, when once loaden with guilt and shame, from attempting to approach {{the presence of}} a holy and a sin-avenging God, unless he can come to him through, and in the name of, an intercessor?
