40|$|Abstract—A comb-actuated {{torsional}} microscanner is devel-oped for high-resolution laser-scanning display systems. Typical torsional comb-drive scanners have fingers placed {{around the}} perimeter of the scanning mirror. In contrast, the structure in this paper uses cascaded frames, where the comb fingers are placed on an outer drive frame, and the motion is transferred to the inner mirror frame with a mechanical gain. The structure works only in resonant mode without requiring any offset in the comb fingers, keeping the silicon-on-insulator-based process quite simple. The design intent is to improve actuator efficiency by removing the high-drag fingers from the high-velocity scanning mirror. Placing them on the lower velocity drive frame reduces their contribution to the damping torque. Furthermore, placement on the drive frame allows an increase of the number of fingers and their capacity to impart torque. The microscanner exhibits a parametric response, and as such, the maximum deflection is found when actuated at twice its natural frequency. Analytical formulas are given for the coupled-mode equations and frame deflections. A simple formula is derived for the mechanical-gain factor. For a 1 -mm × 1. 5 -mm oblong scanning mirror, a 76 ◦ total optical scan angle is achieved at 21. 8 kHz with 196 -V peak-to-peak excitation voltages.

40|$|For {{a camera}} image, the RGB {{response}} from the imaging sensor cannot be used to <b>drive</b> <b>display</b> devices directly. The reason behind this is two-fold: different cameras have different spectral sensitivities, and there are different target output spaces (e. g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, and XYZ). The process of mapping from captured RGBs to an output colour space is called colour correction. Colour Correction is of interest {{in its own right}} (e. g. for colour measurement), but it is also {{an important part of the}} colour processing pipelines found in digital cameras. In this paper, we look at the problem of mapping device RGB values to corresponding CIE XYZ tristimuli. We make three contributions. First, we review and implement a range of colour correction algorithms. We benchmark these algorithms in experiments using both synthetic data (so we can numerically assess a wider range of cameras) and real image data. In our second contribution, we develop an ensemble method to combine colour correction algorithms to further enhance performance. For the methods tested, we find there is small extra power in combining the methods. Our final — and perhaps most important contribution — is to provide an open source colour correction MATLAB toolbox for the community, implementing the algorithms described in the paper. As well, all our experimental data is provided...|$|E
