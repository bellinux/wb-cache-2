5|$|On May 3, 1917, the Brewers {{traveled}} to Indianapolis and defeated the team there {{to improve their}} win-loss record to 7–8. Shay visited a local tavern that night and had some drinks. The tavern owner took Shay to a beauty parlor and introduced him to its owner, Gertrude Anderson. Anderson gave Shay a manicure and accompanied him to the Hotel English. Shay complained to busboy Eugene Jones about the placement of sugar bowls at his table. Clarence Euell, a black waiter at the cafe, came to address Shay's concern. An argument ensued during which Shay pulled out a gun and shot Euell in the abdomen. Euell wrestled Shay to the ground, pressing his <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> on Shay's head.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your <b>foot</b> <b>down.</b> In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> first. You have to put your <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first.

25|$|To {{determine}} if criticism against the women was justified, Sir Alan appointed both as project managers for this task. Claire, who reined in her aggressive side in response, earned praise from her team and Nick, while Lucinda received surprisingly good feedback about her leadership, even impressing Margaret. Of the two, Sugar held reservation that Lucinda lacked force of character {{to put her}} <b>foot</b> <b>down,</b> after she backed down from a suggestion to have manufacturers on both of Alpha's sales teams, hoping they could convey enthusiasm, when she was met by silence from Jennifer, Lindi and Raef.|$|E

50|$|Bower Field, {{which opened}} in May of 1979, was Penn baseball's home field {{immediately}} prior to Meiklejohn. It {{was known to be}} a pitchers' ballpark. Bower was 330 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the line in left field, 340 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the line to right, 410 feet to dead-center, and had a 25-foot high fence extending from left-center to right-center.

50|$|The city raised $13,500, with $6,000 budgeted {{to build}} the ballpark. Bernard Wisehall, a {{prominent}} local architect, designed Federal or Riverbreeze Park) with a capacity of 6,000. The playing field—bounded by East 2nd Street, East 3rd Street, Madison Avenue and Scott Boulevard—was tiny, possibly the smallest ever built for any pro baseball park. Its dimensions were just 194 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the right-field line, 267 feet to dead center, and 218 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the left-field line. Modern rules dictate no pro ballpark may have a fence closer than 325 <b>feet,</b> even <b>down</b> the foul lines. Construction did not begin until a month before opening day.|$|R
25|$|A back march may be {{used when}} the band wishes {{to move in the}} {{opposite}} direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backwards, putting each <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backwards marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backwards, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's next notable {{role was}} the 1955 film Love Me or Leave Me, his third with Day. Cagney played Martin [...] "Moe the Gimp" [...] Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney {{described}} the script as [...] "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When {{the film was}} released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: [...] "What I did was very simple. I just slapped my <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> as I turned it out while walking. That's all".|$|E

It was during this time that he cut red meat from his diet to begin his new near-vegetarian diet. At this point new Stoke manager Frank Taylor enquired as to whether he might bring Matthews back to the club; all parties agreed to the idea in {{principle}} until Joe Smith put his <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> to ensure he stayed, with an inspirational speech he promised Matthews that an FA Cup winners medal was still possible, telling him that [...] "a lot of people think I'm mad, but even though you're 37, I believe your best football is still to come." ...|$|E

His shots off the back <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty.

500|$|The riders then {{entered the}} crucial {{section of the}} Paterberg and Oude Kwaremont. Devenyns {{attacked}} alone from the breakaway group, while Sep Vanmarcke (...) attacked the peloton. Vanmarcke was riding the climb in the gutter {{to one side of}} the road. He slipped in the mud and had to put a <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> on the cobblestones; this damaged his shoe and left him unable to clip into his pedal, reducing his ability to apply power on the climbs. He continued with the broken shoe over the Paterberg and Oude Kwaremont until he was able to change it on a flat section of road. Vanmarcke was in a small group of riders that earned a gap on the Paterberg, but they were caught soon afterwards. At this point there a chase group of around 30 riders, half a minute behind Devenyns as they entered the Oude Kwaremont.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{characters}} are procedurally animated via simulated physics models and inverse kinematics (IK)—a system designed by programmer Seamus Blackley. Basic physics {{are used to}} move character models through the environment, and the models are animated by the IK system in accordance with this movement. Designer Richard Wyckoff later compared the character physics to those of a marble, and Schmidt described the technique as akin to putting each character in a hamster ball. The system's imperfect nature can result in animation glitches. A more realistic simulation of bipedal movement was originally planned, but it was simplified before release because of coding difficulties. Schmidt later said that the original method [...] "almost always worked", but that [...] "every thirty minutes someone would put their <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> slightly wrong ... and then go flying off across the map". A physics model {{is also used to}} simulate weapon recoil, the arc of projectiles and the gravity of each planet; for example, projectiles travel farther in low gravity environments.|$|E

Huge nets were put in left field to keep balls in play, preventing easy home runs, and also to prevent balls from reaching the adjacent street.|$|R
500|$|In the {{remaining}} 17 weeks of war the Jagdwaffe struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force. In strategic terms, German historian Werner Girbig wrote, [...] "Operation Bodenplatte {{amounted to a}} total defeat". The exhausted German units were {{no longer able to}} mount an effective defence of German air space during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the Allied crossing of the Rhine River, or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany. Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole, and could not challenge Allied air supremacy. The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties was the night fighter force. In the last six weeks of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed. Girbig wrote, [...] "it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> the sacrificial path; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal blow and sealed its fate. What happened from then on {{was no more than a}} dying flicker".|$|E
