30|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of this step is to cover the point space with line segments representing the long axes of <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> and therefore, each point of the shape should be assigned to an eccentric ellipse.

The process is initialized with one ellipse, corresponding to the covariance of the initial points set centered at the mean value of the point locations. Thresholds T 1 and T 2 may be computed with a heuristic algorithm, as explained in Section 3.1.|$|R
50|$|At first, many astronomers {{thought that}} Sgr dSph had already reached an {{advanced}} state of destruction, {{so that a}} large part of its original matter was already mixed with that of the Milky Way.

50|$|Relevant {{keyholes}} {{are those}} close to the uncertainty ellipsoid projected onto the b-plane, where it becomes an <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse.</b> The ellipse shrinks and jitters as new observations of the asteroid {{are added to the}} evaluation. If the probable path of the asteroid keeps close to a keyhole, the precise position of the keyhole itself would matter. It varies with the incoming direction and velocitiy of the asteroid and with the non-gravitational forces acting on it between the two encounters. Thus, “a miss is as good as a mile,” does not apply to a keyhole of several hundred meter width. However, changing the path of an asteroid by a mile can be done with a relatively small impulse if the first encounter is still years away. Deflecting the asteroid after the fly-by would need a much stronger impulse.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{technology}} behind direction finding was simple and well understood by both sides, but the technology commonly used {{before the war}} used a manually-rotated aerial to fix {{the direction of the}} transmitter. This was delicate work, took quite a time to accomplish to any degree of accuracy, and since it only revealed the line along which the transmission originated a single set could not determine if the transmission was from the true direction or its reciprocal 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Two sets were required to fix the position. Believing this to still be the case, German U-boat radio operators considered themselves fairly safe if they kept messages short. The British, however, developed an oscilloscope-based indicator which instantly fixed the direction and its reciprocal the moment a radio operator touched his Morse key. It worked simply with a crossed pair of conventional and fixed directional aerials, the oscilloscope display showing the relative received strength from each aerial as an <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse</b> showing the line relative to the ship. The innovation was a 'sense' aerial which when switched in, suppressed the ellipse in the 'wrong' direction leaving only the correct bearing. With this there was hardly any need to triangulate—the escort could just run down the precise bearing provided and use radar for final positioning. Many U-boat attacks were suppressed and submarines sunk in this way—a good example of the great difference apparently minor aspects of technology could make to the battle.|$|E

First, the size discrimination thresholds decreased with an increase in the circularity of the ellipses. Second, size discrimination thresholds were lower than aspect ratio thresholds, except for the circle and more <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> where both were similar.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} model a set of unordered points by line segments. The result of the method is a {{sequence}} of straight line segments modeling the points, which correspond to the major axes of highly eccentric ellipses fitted on them. We call the procedure Direct Split-and-Merge algorithm or DSaM. The points may correspond to the locations of edge pixels. The basic idea relies on a split-and-merge process, where the algorithm is initialized by one ellipse, representing the mean and the covariance of the initial point set, which is then split, through an iterative scheme, until {{a number of small}} and <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> occurs. Then, a merge process takes place to combine the resulting ellipses {{in order to reduce the}} complexity of the representation. At the end, the algorithm provides a relatively small number of <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> fitted on the points. The proposed method is general and may also model a set of points containing inner structures, such as joints. Numerical experiments on common shape databases are presented to underpin the performance of the proposed method. Also, edgemaps of natural images were used in our experiments to verify the efficiency of the method on real data. The number of ellipses depends on the structure of points, and it is determined by two parameters controlling both the split and the merge processes. The extension of the method to a three-dimensional (3 D) case is trivial, as the <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> may be transformed to 3 D ellipsoids. In the 3 D case, our rationale is to model the points by highly eccentric ellipsoids, thus, instead of line segments, multiple 2 D planes fit to points. In that case, data from range images could be modeled. A preliminary version of this method was introduced in [23]. Note that our method is not affected by degradations in the contour, and thus, it is more reliable compared to the distance transform [24] or the medial axis transformation [25], as it assumes more relaxed initial conditions (a set of unordered points) compared to conventional shape description methods, where point traversal should be known a priori.|$|R

30|$|The {{role of the}} merge {{process is}} to reduce the {{complexity}} of the model. In case there exist adjacent ellipses whose major axes have similar orientations, it would be beneficial to merge and replace them with a more <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse.</b> Therefore, in this step, ellipses are merged using the following rule: merge two consecutive ellipses, if the resulting ellipse has minimum eigenvalue smaller than a threshold T 1 (linearity) and the marginal width between the two line clusters is smaller than a threshold T 2 (disconnectivity).|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the image by the Lorentz Transformation of a spherical light {{wavefront}}, emitted by a moving source, is not a spherical light wavefront but an ellipsoidal light wavefront. Poincaré's <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse</b> is the direct geometrical representation of Poincaré's relativity of simultaneity. Einstein's circles are the direct geometrical representation of Einstein's convention of synchronisation. Poincaré's ellipse supposes another convention for the definition of space-time units involving that the Lorentz Transformation (LT) of an unit of length is directly proportional to the LT of an unit of time: This is Poincaré's definition of isotropic elongated distance (with dilated travel time). The historical (polemical) problem of priorities is therefore scientifically solved because Einstein's explicit kinematics and Poincaré's implicit kinematics are not the same. It is generally admitted that the observed expansion of space (Hubble) can only {{be considered in the}} framework of General Relativity (Robertson-Walker's metric) and not in the framework on Special Relativity (Minkowski's metric). We show that Poincaré's relativistic kinematics, with the invariance of the quadratic form by LT, predicts both a dilation of time and an isotropic expansion of space as well.

40|$|For small stimuli, it {{has been}} shown that {{subjects}} are very accurate in distinguishing a cylinder with an elliptical cross section from one with a circular cross section. In such a task, both curvature and length are integrated effectively. Large cylinders are explored differently: either by one hand or by two hands sliding over the surface. However, the same cues are available. We investigated the integration of position and curvature in unimanual and bimanual explorations. In Experiment 1, curved surfaces were presented as part of a horizontal cylinder with a cross section that was either a horizontally or a vertically <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse.</b> We found that discrimination thresholds for unimanual exploration were significantly larger than for bimanual exploration. In Experiment 2, we found that position discrimination thresholds were independent of the type of exploration (unimanual or bimanual) and surprisingly also independent of the reference length. In Experiment 3, we found that discrimination thresholds for the position of the midsagittal plane were on an average lower than the position discrimination thresholds found in Experiment 2. From these findings, we conclude that the lower thresholds in Experiment 1 for bimanual exploration compared to unimanual exploration are due to the integration of curvature, not position or uncertainty of the midsagittal plane in unimanual exploration. © 2008 - 2011 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|What is the Lorentz {{transformation}} (LT) of a spherical wavefront (a set of simultaneous events) ? According to Einstein (1905) the LT {{produces a}} spherical wavefront whilst according to Poincaré (1908) the LT produces an ellipsoidal wavefront (the events {{are no longer}} simultaneous). What is the LT of a plane wavefront (a set of simultaneous events) ? According to Einstein the LT is a space transversal (to the direction of propagation) plane wavefront. According to Poincaré, the LT is a non transversal spacetime wavefront (the tangent plane to the ellipsoid). We show that this contrast between Einstein's and Poincaré's theory of wavefronts is not connected with the electromagnetic fields but with electromagnetic potentials. Poincaré's explicit choice is the Lorenz gauge while Einstein's implicit choice is the transverse gauge. In other words, the convention of synchronization of clocks with light signals is not the same. We show that Poincaré's <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse</b> in {{the system of the}} source is not only a direct explanation of the null result of Michelson's experiment but also a direct explanation of the non null Sagnac's experiment.

Our 2011 – 2013 observations of the northern aurora are also compared with those from our 2007 – 2008 observation of the southern aurora. We show that the variety of morphologies of the northern auroras is broadly consistent with the southern, and determine the statistical equatorward and poleward boundary locations. We find that our boundaries are overall consistent with previous observations, although a modest poleward displacement of the poleward boundaries {{is due to the}} increased prevalence of poleward auroral patches in the noon and afternoon sectors during this program, likely due to the solar wind interaction. We also show that the northern auroral oval oscillates with the northern planetary period oscillation (PPO) phase in an <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipse</b> with semi-major axis ∼ 1. 6 ° oriented along the post-dawn/post-dusk direction.

This study is based on 12. 8 µm images obtained with the burst mode of VISIR (the Very Large Telescope Imager and Spectrometer in the InfraRed). The interferometric processing allows to push the resolution far below the diffraction limit of a 8 m telescope in the N band and to trace two main contributions to the mid-IR flux inside the nucleus. It also allows to partially fill the lack of visibility points at low spatial frequencies. The confrontation with VLT/MIDI (the Mid-InfrareD Interferometer) data points helps to establish the link between dust {{in the vicinity of}} the central engine and inside the ionisation cone to get a multi-scale picture of mid-IR sources emitting in the nucleus of NGC 1068. 1.

However, these are costly and mechanically complex, since they require additional spur gear reducers in the loop. ISO directives document the use of crossed helical gear pairs as virtual gears for hypoids to calculate the sliding velocity since, the flank geometry at the mean point can be precisely represented. The use of such pairs can be a cost effective and simpler alternative for testing purposes. However, the validity of this analogy regarding contact mechanics and tribology for the full mesh cycle has not been investigated hitherto.

De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls.

In particular, the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) has proposed a figure of merit FoM for DE studies consisting of the inverse of the area of the 95 % confidence contour for two parameters describing the DE equation of state: its equation of state now (w 0) and its derivative (wa, where w(z) = w 0 +wa(1 -a) and a = (1 +z) - 1), expressed as FoM= 1 /[6. 17 (2 w 02 wa 2 w 0 wa) 1 / 2], with standard deviations in measuring the equation of state parameters (Wang 2008). A simple cosmological constant is uniquely parameterized by w 0 = 1 and wa = 0, while alternatively proposed models can be distinguished according to w 0 and wa (Caldwell & Linder 2005). In order to constrain w 0 and wa, we need to perform cosmological surveys, which tend to produce <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> in the (w 0, wa), or other parameter pairs we might consider e. g., (de, w 0). To localize the allowed (w 0, wa) value, we need two survey techniques to provide measurements with quasi-orthogonal error ellipses intersecting in the (w 0, wa) plane. To check this, one needs a third quasi-orthogonal (non-parallel) technique. To prevent an unfortunate alignment of systematic errors producing an erroneous intersection (or to “break the tie ” if thre...|$|R
40|$|We use inelastic neutron {{scattering}} to systematically investigate the Ni-doping {{evolution of the}} low-energy spin excitations in BaFe 2 -xNixAs 2 spanning from underdoped antiferromagnet to overdoped superconductor (0. 03 < x < 0. 18). In the undoped state, the low-energy (< 80 meV) spin waves of BaFe 2 As 2 form transversely <b>elongated</b> <b>ellipses</b> in the [H, K] plane of the reciprocal space. Upon Ni-doping, the c-axis magnetic exchange coupling is rapidly suppressed and the momentum distribution of spin excitations in the [H, K] plane is enlarged in both the transverse and longitudinal directions {{with respect to the}} in-plane AF ordering wave vector of the parent compound. As a function of increasing Ni-doping x, the spin excitation widths increase linearly but with a larger rate along the transverse direction. These results are in general agreement with calculations of dynamic susceptibility based on the random phase approximation (RPA) in an itinerant electron picture. For samples near optimal superconductivity at x= 0. 1, a neutron spin resonance appears in the superconducting state. Upon further increasing the electron-doping to decrease the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the intensity of the low-energy magnetic scattering decreases and vanishes concurrently with vanishing superconductivity in the overdoped side of the superconducting dome. Comparing with the low-energy spin excitations centered at commensurate AF positions for underdoped and optimally doped materials (x< 0. 1), spin excitations in the over-doped side (x= 0. 15) form transversely incommensurate spin excitations, consistent with the RPA calculation. Therefore, the itinerant electron approach provides a reasonable description to the low-energy AF spin excitations in BaFe 2 -xNixAs 2. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
