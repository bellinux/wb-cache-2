In the laboratory, germination was greater at higher alternating temperatures (30 / 20 and 35 / 25 C) than at the lowest alternating temperatures (25 / 15 C). An after-ripening period of at least 3 mo was required to improve the germination of <b>goosegrass.</b> Germination was tolerant of salt stress but sensitive to a high degree of water stress.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Goosegrass</b> (Eleusine indica L.), {{a serious}} annual weed in the world, has evolved {{resistance}} to several herbicides including paraquat, a non-selective herbicide. The mechanism of paraquat resistance in weeds is only partially understood. To further study the molecular mechanism underlying paraquat resistance in <b>goosegrass,</b> we performed transcriptome analysis of susceptible and resistant biotypes of <b>goosegrass</b> {{with or without}} paraquat treatment. RESULTS: The RNA-seq libraries generated 194, 716, 560 valid reads with an average length of 91. 29 bp. De novo assembly analysis produced 158, 461 transcripts with an average length of 1153. 74 bp and 100, 742 unigenes with an average length of 712. 79 bp. Among these, 25, 926 unigenes were assigned to 65 GO terms that contained three main categories. A total of 13, 809 unigenes with 1, 208 enzyme commission numbers were assigned to 314 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways, and 12, 719 unigenes were categorized into 25 KOG classifications. Furthermore, our results revealed that 53 genes related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, 10 genes related to polyamines and 18 genes related to transport were differentially expressed in paraquat treatment experiments. The genes related to polyamines and transport are likely potential candidate genes that could be further investigated to confirm their roles in paraquat resistance of <b>goosegrass.</b> CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale transcriptome sequencing of E. indica using the Illumina platform. Potential genes involved in paraquat resistance were identified from the assembled sequences. The transcriptome data {{may serve as a}} reference for further analysis of gene expression and functional genomics studies, and will facilitate the study of paraquat resistance at the molecular level in <b>goosegrass...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{cases of}} {{herbicide}} resistance in <b>goosegrass</b> {{have been confirmed}} worldwide. Reports of control failures after glyphosate application have been observed, especially in the Midwest region of Paraná State. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the existence of <b>goosegrass</b> populations resistant to glyphosate. For this, 25 populations collected in two consecutive seasons (2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015) were sown and grown in greenhouse. Glyphosate dose-response curve experiments were performed using doses of 0, 60, 120, 240, 480, 960, 1, 920, 3, 840, 7, 680 and 15, 360 g a. e. ha- 1. The application stages were from two to three tillers (E 1) for the populations of 2013 / 2014 and E 1 and five to six tillers (E 2) for the populations of 2014 / 2015. Furthermore, three of the populations supposedly considered resistant in these experiments (populations 7, 19 and 25) have had their F 1 submitted to the herbicide dose-response test in order to verify whether the resistance was inheritable. With the results obtained in this study, it was concluded that the populations 19 and 25, from Campo Mourão and Luziânia (Midwest of Paraná) are the first confirmed cases of <b>goosegrass</b> resistant to glyphosate in Brazil (RF = 3. 99 to 6. 81), following all the criteria for confirmation of new weed resistance cases...|$|E
