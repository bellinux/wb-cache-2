According to laboratory researchers, changes in humidity, temperature or pH value {{as well as}} starvation periods {{were thought to be}} the triggers in some species. The plasmodia abandon their nutrient intake and crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores.

25|$|As already mentioned, the Spanish {{version of}} the Halakot Gedolot, {{probably}} made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would not be far wrong in setting the 9th century as the date of composition.

At any rate this collection contains much that is old, even if <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> proved that the Megillat Ḥasidim, which is cited in Abot de-Rabbi Natan (ed.

500|$|The fungus is one {{of several}} dozen Mycena species that are bio{{luminescent}}.

500|$|Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts {{investigated}} how {{the effect}} held up under so-called 'threats' to the self. Earlier research by Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis had already {{shown that the}} name-letter effect is influenced by a perceived threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts first made some participants write about a personal flaw and then gave all participants the Number Preference Task and the Letter Preference Task. What they found was consistent with previous findings: people who liked themselves a lot liked the numbers in their birthday and the letters of their name even more when an aspect of their self seemed under threat. This is predicted by the theory of unconscious self-enhancement. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> explained by [...] mere exposure theory.|$|E

500|$|The first {{occasion}} {{after the}} mourning period that re-allowed concerted church music was {{the feast of}} Visitation, Thursday [...] It is possible that Bach produced his {{new version of the}} Magnificat for this occasion, although Christmas of the same year as first performance date for the new version is possible too: <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> determined with certainty on which day around 1732–1735 the Dmajor version of the Magnificat was first performed, and until when Bach amended the score to its final state. Around 1733 Bach filed two cantatas by Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel, for the fifth and the sixth Sunday after Trinity (5 and 12 July in 1733): Bach may have relied on church music by other composers for the services in Leipzig in July 1733, while composing and copying out the performance parts of the extensive first part of the Mass in Bminor.|$|E
