In the last decade, the copula approach has been investigated in hydrological practice to assess the design <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> in terms of flood peak, volume and duration. In this paper, the copula approach is exploited to perform pair analyses of these three random variables for two Italian watersheds, in the Apennine and the Alps respectively. The criterion to separate continuous flow series into independent events is discussed along with its implications on the dependence structure. The goodness-of-fits of the proposed copulas are then assessed by non-parametric tests. Marginal distributions to derive joint distributions are briefly suggested.

The main objective was the production of <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> by calculating average flow velocities (inside and outside the stream network). The usefulness of the flow velocities lies in using them in other ungauged small-forested watersheds that have similar geomorphological and hydrological characteristics. The meteorological and hydrological data of four storm events were obtained from the corresponding stations that are located near and at the outlet of the watershed, respectively. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology was used for the obtainment of the spatially distributed watershed characteristics. The resolution of the digital elevation model and the produced rasters was 50 X 50 m 2.

To find out {{the performance of the}} Wonogiri reservoir in flood control of Bengawan Solo, a study was conducted on <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> characteristics of the reservoir inflow by considering the contribution inflow from all sub-watersheds in the reservoir catchment area, at the end of December 2007. Calculation analysis <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of Wonogiri Reservoir inflow is done with the calibration of Wuryantoro and Keduang sub-watersheds. Results of the calibration were then used reference to simulate <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> inflow in each sub-watershed catchment areas. Flood routing in the reservoir was done with the assumption that the inflow of the reservoir was left to face up a height of water in the reservoir 135. 3 m (the lower flood control limit) and 138. 3 m (the upper flood control limit) and then the spillway gates full-opening. Results of this research indicated that the maximum discharge inflow into the reservoir on the event of Wonogiri flood at the end of December 2007 was ranged from 3, 331 to 4, 993 m 3 /s; and it was occurred on December 26, 2007 at between 04 : 00 - 06 : 00 am. The most dominant <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> contribution into the reservoir was derived from Keduang sub-watershed. The flood in the reservoir was simulated as that the spillway gates were closed until water level of reservoir reached the minimum height of 135. 3 m and 138. 3 m and only until then the spillway gates full-opening. The reservoir water level reached 135. 47 m on December 26, 2007 at 6 : 00 am and outflow was generated when the gates opened to reach 550 m 3 /s and then increased up to 642 m 3 /s at 14 : 00 after then it gradually decreases. The water level simulation was unable to reach 138. 3 m because up to December 27, 2007 at 23 : 00 the water level reservoir reaches only 136. 44 m.

The network models represent a considerable advance in this direction even though these models are based on many assumptions and empirical relationships. Watershed Bounded Network Model (WBNM) is one such model. This model maintains a good relationship between the hydrological and geomorphological properties of a watershed and is capable of accurate <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> synthesis. The model can account for the non-uniform distribution of rainfall over the watershed. Lag is a dominant factor to be known for the successful application of WBNM. In this paper the theoretical basis of WBNM and its application to Pageru watershed in southern India is presented. The watershed contains three well spread rain gauges. Isolated flood events from a four years record were considered for the calibration of the model.

40|$|Flood routing is {{commonly}} {{used to calculate the}} shape of the <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the downstream end of a reservoir or a river reach, if the <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the upstream end of the reach is known. The flood routing procedure also enables prediction of the time at which the flood will occur at the downstream station. One of the methods of flood routing which has been widely applied in engineering practice because of its simplicity and accuracy is the Muskingum method. This method {{is based on the assumption}} of a linear algebraic relationship between inflow I, outflow Q and storage S in a reach. The equation used is basically and numerically derived from the differential equation of continuity or conservation of mass. As mentioned above, flood routing normally involves the use of an upstream hydrograph to estimate a downstream hydrograph, an example is estimating the <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the downstream end of a river reach. An estimate of the upstream hydrograph from the recorded <b>flood</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the downstream end is sometimes required. This case is less common, but still significant. For example, it can be needed to fill in missing records using those at a downstream station. This reverse routing equation, mathematically, can be deduced easily from the conventional Muskingum equation, i. e. : re-arranging the Muskingum equation to solve for inflow I given outflow Q. Difficulties often arise, since the process is numerically unstable. This numerical instability can cause the process to diverge from the true solution or oscillations to occur in the calculated upstream hydrograph. In practice, satisfactory upstream hydrographs cannot be obtained. This project is intended to investigate that problem, to determine the cause of the numerical instability and to develop some alternative approaches which can overcome the problem. Several methods of solution were investigated, including an iterative approach combined with a smoothing and averaging algorithms. Results using this method show that the numerical instability can be overcome by selecting an appropriate time step (routing period), which has been shown to depend on the values of the Muskingum model parameters. The solution converges rapidly because of the use of the averaging algorithm, and accurate estimates of the upstream hydrograph are obtained. It can be said that this method has the same order of accuracy as the conventional downstream routing using the Muskingum method...|$|E

The highly accurate flood forecasting is desired very strongly inorder to regulate the flood flow efficiently, because their drainage areas are relativelysamll, several hundreds sq. kilometers. Flood runoff consists of three components, groundwater runoff, interfiow and surfacerunoff, which show different behaviors respectively in a runoff process.

A Monte Carlo experiment was carried out to generate an ensemble of hydrographs that keep the statistical properties of marginal distributions of peaks, volumes and durations. This ensemble can be applied to determine the Design <b>Flood</b> <b>Hydrograph</b> (DFH) for a reservoir, which is not a unique hydrograph, but a curve in the peak-volume space.

40|$|Abstract: A dynamic {{stochastic}} model for synthesis of daily flows and <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> {{at a certain}} site in a river reach is presented in this paper. The inputs to the model are the inflows at an upstream point of the reach and the rainfall on the basin between the upstream and downstream points. The model consists of three parts: an inflow-outflow transfer function model, a Kalman filter for the lateral flow contribution of the drainage basin and a second order autoregressive model for the noise component. The model for the lateral flow contribution to the outflow was necessary to correct the outflows given by the inflow-outflow transfer function {{of the system and}} it enables proper accounting of the lateral flow into the reach. The model is tested by using observed data. Daily flows and <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> at the downstream location simulated by using the model have been shown to agree with the historic data with remarkable accuracy.

It is also shown that there is an obvious effect of cutting and lagging fllod on the simulated rainfall sub-flood process. ...|$|E
40|$|The storage-routing {{approach}} has been successfully applied to the rainfall-runoff processes in subbasins as well as flood propagations in channels. We additionally propose the new approach, which can {{take into account the}} surfacesubsurface runoff as well as groundwater runoff in the subbasin runoff modeling, using the two-cascade storage routing model. The two runoff components can be separated via use of the numerical filter so that the optimal parameters of each component can be independently identified. Especially, the parameters of groundwater runoff component can be automatically determined by the known parameters and hence computational burdens can be significantly reduced. We show that the proposed approach can remarkably improve the reproduction of <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> when the <b>flood</b> flows are routed through both of subbasin and channel phases...|$|R
40|$|Flood hazard maps at trans-national scale have {{potential}} for {{a large number of}} applications ranging from climate change studies, reinsurance products, aid to emergency operations for major flood crisis, among others. However, at continental scales, only few products are available, due to the difficulty of retrieving large consistent data sets. Moreover, these are produced at relatively coarse grid resolution, which limits their applications to qualitative assessments. At finer resolution, maps are often limited to country boundaries, due to limited data sharing at trans-national level. The creation of a European flood hazard map would currently imply a collection of scattered regional maps, often lacking mutual consistency due to the variety of adopted approaches and quality of the underlying input data. In this work, we derive a pan-European flood hazard map at 100 [*]m resolution. The proposed approach is based on expanding a literature cascade model through a physically based approach. A combination of distributed hydrological and hydraulic models was set up for the European domain. Then, an observed meteorological data set is used to derive a long-term streamflow simulation and subsequently coherent design <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> for a return period of 100 [*]years along the pan-European river network. <b>Flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> are used to simulate areas at risk of flooding and output maps are merged into a pan-European flood hazard map. The quality of this map is evaluated for selected areas in Germany and United Kingdom against national/regional hazard maps. Despite inherent limitations and model resolution issues, simulated maps are in good agreement with reference maps (hit rate between 59 % and 78 %, critical success index between 43 % and 65 %), suggesting strong {{potential for a}} number of applications at the European scale.

40|$|The {{availability}} of a real-time operational system for mapping flood hazard and assessing potential consequences might be extremely useful to help emergency response and management and to mitigate the impact of large flood events. This work describes {{the development of an}} experimental procedure for rapid flood risk assessment within the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), which since 2012 provides operational flood predictions for the major European rivers as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Services. The hydro-meteorological data set available in EFAS is used to derive long-term streamflow simulations and design <b>flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> in a wide number of locations, covering all the major European river network. <b>Flood</b> <b>hydrographs</b> are then used as input to a hydrodynamic 2 D model to create a high resolution dataset of areas at risk of flooding for different return periods. Whenever a flood event is forecasted in EFAS, the flood maps of the river network sections potentially involved are merged together, based on the estimated magnitude of the event. In order {{to take into account the}} different flood forecasts available in EFAS, different combinations of flood hazard maps may be produced, to highlight the possible range of uncertainty in predictions. The merged flood maps can be combined with the available spatial information about land use, population, urban areas and infrastructures, to assess the potential impact of the forecasted flood event in terms of economic damage, affected population, major infrastructures and cities. A preliminary version of the procedure has been successfully tested in reproducing flooded areas and impacts in the recent floods in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. Moreover, the reduced computational times are compatible with near real-time applications, even in case of multiple flood events affecting several countries. Currently, the integration of the procedure within EFAS for operational use is being tested. JRC. H. 7 -Climate Risk Managemen...|$|R
