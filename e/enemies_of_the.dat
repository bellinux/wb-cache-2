5|$|In 481BC, a {{congress}} of Greek city-states was held, during which 30 or so states agreed to ally {{themselves against the}} forthcoming invasion. The Spartans and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persians.|$|E
5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to {{the decline of the}} prestige of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, Solomon and his cousins jointly {{fought against the}} Czechs, the Cumans and other <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom. Their relationship deteriorated in the early 1070s and Géza rebelled against him. Solomon could only maintain his rule in a small zone along the western frontiers of Hungary after his defeat in the Battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074. He officially abdicated in 1081, but was arrested for conspiring against Géza's brother and successor, Ladislaus.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sandwedge was a {{proposed}} clandestine intelligence-gathering operation against the political <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Richard Nixon presidential administration. The proposals were {{put together by}} H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti-Vietnam War movement, inspired by what he {{believed to be the}} Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm.|$|E

The army numbered 30,000 men, backed up by 1,300 Norman knights. The fleet sailed to Avalona in Byzantine territory; they were joined by several ships from Ragusa, a republic in the Balkans who were <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|A hairy and fiery star having {{then made}} its {{appearance}} for several days, the mathematicians declared {{that there would}} follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E

5|$|From {{the death}} of Rognvald, Harald Maddadsson pursued a policy of {{supporting}} the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings of Scotland, first Malcolm IV, who died young in 1165, then Malcolm's brother William. Of these enemies, those who were active {{in the north and}} west, where Harald's power was significant, were Somerled, king of Argyll and Hebrides (who married earl Harold's first cousin Ragnhild of the Isle of Man), the sons of Máel Coluim mac Alasdair, illegitimate son of King Alexander I, himself held prisoner at Roxburgh, the Meic Uilleim, the descendants of William fitz Duncan, and the MacHeths and dispossessed would-be Mormaers of Ross (who possibly were a branch of the ancient Loairn dynasty of Moray and claimants of its rights).|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E

As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state.

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the Yucatán Peninsula was still {{dominated}} by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal injection was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E
