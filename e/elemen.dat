He sought the unsealing and resurrection of Rimsala, to unleash her ancient evil upon <b>Elemen</b> again. In the conflict, King Wagnall's two daughters disappeared. It was also the last battle for the Knights of Lexford, a trio of brave fighters sworn to Wagnall, which dissolved as the war drew to a close.

50|$|The purported {{evidence}} for including <b>Eleman</b> in the Trans-New Guinea family lies in Kaki Ae.

However, Glottolog notes that the sound correspondences are just what would expect from loans, given the different phonologies of the languages: <b>Eleman</b> has no n/l/r distinction, and Kaki Ae has no t/k distinction.|$|R

In this MSc. Thesis, {{a design}} metodology of a {{wideband}} microwave power amplifier using non-linear device model is proposed in details over a design example. And design steps are explained {{as could be}} as in details to be usefull for microwave power amplifier designers who encounter with similar issues. It {{can be considered as}} a motivation point that usage of a non-linear device model which is also take part on the name of this study. Because modelling and studying such a non-linear device can not be possible via linear equation sets {{and most of the time}} optimization algorithms can not convergence on the solution. In addition if the desired bandwidth is wide, it will be more difficult and nearly impossible to solve equations and  usage of the optimization algorithms will be useless due to the convergance problems. For these reasons, such a study is done using a computer-aided and user-driven method and design systems and design steps are explained in details as could be as possible. The Simplified Real Frequency Tecchnique (SRFT) which is popular in literature with its ability of broadband matching solutions also implemented in the design steps. And at the final of the work, a wideband microwave power amplifier is designed and prototyped in success. On the path of production, post layout simulation called “cosimulation” is implemented and realistic vendor models are used in the cosimulation to observe realistic effects. The simulation results of the designed circuit are seen sufficiently satisfying. After ideally designed and simulated with cosimulation tool, the circuit is prototyped and measured. Measurement results are in aggrement with simulation results which shows the prototyp circuit works well.   Classical microwave circuit design relies on the linear network parameters such as s-parameters due to their capability of characterizing the behavior of any linear circuit successfully. Furthermore, the classical design and analysis of linear microwave transistor based circuits are based on the simple analytical approaches which utilize the transistor s-parameters. So that it is not complicated to provide an analytical solution for the input and output variables and analytically determining fundamental parameters as the stability factor, the power gain contours or the input-output matching conditions. But all these happens when the microwave devices operates in their linear regions. S parameters depends on super position principle and only passive microwave circuits such as filters, couplers, power dividers, etc., and active microwave devices such as amplifiers that operates small signal operating points can be characterized in accuracy with them. If the amplifiers input signal level increases over its linear region, super position principle becomes no more useful, distortions such as gain compression, harmonic production and entermodluation begins to form. For the last few decades, the linear system theory was utilizing in success on the design of microwave circuits. This linearity approach was modelling the linear microwave devices succesfully and characterizing them consistently with the support of vectorel network analyzers (VNA). Nevertheless, todays systems of space and aeronautics, social media and mobile personal communication devices make it inevitable to operate the active network device in its non-linear region to improve efficiency and bandwidth. So on this path, usage of linear theory gives no more use and in becomes a neccesity to study the non-linear parameters and characterizing such devices with them. Some examples of these kind of non-linear applications can be found on RF power amplfier studies which requires high power and mostly operates its non-linear region. It is important to design of microwave power amplifiers with high power level and it depends to the transistors non-linear model to low cost design and high efficiency. One of the main problem in the microwave circuit design with large signals is the difficulty of the design with complex, non-linear devices to achieve desired delivered power level, desired efficiency and good reflectances. Since the non-liear device can not be modeled with linear equation sets, several design steps are required to achieve desired criterias on the input and output regions. And these processes take importance for time efficiency and performance. For this reason it is important that to select a suitable optimum design methodology for the desired circuit. In the study desired design criterias are achieved for the microwave power amplifier circuit which contains non-linear device model. On the design process, different kind of design techniques in the literature are used to solve different problems encountered on the different steps of the design.   The thesis contains six main chapters. In the first part, the introduction and problem definition take place. The second chapter of the study takes a brief look to the non-linear design models and discuss about why they are important and how they can be obtained comparing them small signal parameters. In the third chapter, power amplifiers and their design techniques are introduced. Some important parameters about power amplifier designs are explained in the chapter three. Also in this chapter, broadband matching problems and some common matching techniques are explained.   The fourth chapter, which is the longest part of the study is the section where the design of broadband microwave power amplifier with non-linear device model started. In this section, the matching techniques are implemented, reflectance levels of the circuit are reduced, flat gain is obtained and all desing criterias are achieved over the ideal case and the ideal design is completed with high success. In the fifth chapter, the designed ideal circuit in chapter four is prepared for the prototype production. The layout design is made and cosimulations are performed. According to the results, the post layout optimizations are done and also good results are obtained for the post layout design. Also in this chapter, the prototyped circuit and its measurement results are given. It is observed that the measurement results are in a good agreements with simulation results.   The last section, chapter six is the conclusion part. In this section, the completed study is overviewed and required discussion and future works are given. In the final of the work, a microwave power amplifier with a ultra-wide bandwidth from ~ 0. 8 GHz to ~ 3. 2 GHz, and has nearly 4 - 6 Watt output power on the operating bandwidth is achieved. The harmonic performance shows also good results. Circuit is includes Cree’s Gan HEMT power transistor and designed with it’s  large signal model. Input and outpt matching networks are designed with using several methods in combination. All the design steps are detailed in related section.   However the design of a wideband microwave power amplifier using non linear device model is explained over a design example. The study and techniques that used can be generalized for different design criterias. And it is hoped that this study will help power amplifier designers challenging with wide bandwidth and non-linear devices. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

30|$|Variations in the {{geomagnetic}} field are frequently observed {{in association with}} the propagation of seismic waves (e.g., <b>Eleman,</b> 1965; Matsushima et al., 2002; Iyemori et al., 2005; Abdul Azeez et al., 2009). Although such variations are usually considered to arise from two mechanisms—the electrokinetic effect (Ishido and Mizutani, 1981; Pride, 1994; Garambois and Dietrich, 2001; Bordes et al., 2008) and electromagnetic induction due to ground motions (e.g., Iyemori et al., 1996; Honkura et al., 2002, 2004; Ujihara et al., 2004)—there are other candidate mechanisms, such as those related to the resonance of ions (Honkura et al., 2009), the piezoelectric effect (Ogawa and Utada, 2000 a, b) and the piezomagnetic effect. Among these other mechanisms, the piezomagnetic effect is investigated in the study reported here. The piezomagnetic effect involves changes in the magnetization of ferromagnetic minerals under mechanical stress (Stacey, 1964; Nagata, 1970; Stacey and Johnston, 1972). In the case that co-seismic variations are observed only in the magnetic field (e.g., Okubo et al., 2009), the contribution of the piezomagnetic effect {{must be taken into account}} because the electrokinetic effect and electromagnetic induction primarily generate electrical fields. Previous studies on variations in the {{geomagnetic field}} arising from the piezomagnetic effect have been performed in a framework of elastostatics (see the review by Sasai, 1994). To interpret co-seismic variations in magnetic fields in terms of the piezomagnetic effect, however, theories should be reconsidered in a framework of elastodynamics.|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Bu tez kapsamında, üç boyutlu düzensiz bir yapı sisteminin doğrusal ve doğrusal olmayan analizleri DOC 3 B yapı analiz programı ile gerçekleştirilmiştir. Analizi için tasarlanmış olan yapıda kat planının sadece üst köşe elemanlarında birer perde <b>eleman</b> bulunmaktadır. Bu tip bir perde yerleşim seçimi ile yapı örneğine burulma düzensizliği kazandırılmıştır. Gerçek yapıyı doğru bir şekilde modellemek, doğru sonuçlar elde edebilmek için oldukça büyük önem taşımaktadır. Bu sebepten ötürü her bir yapı elemanı da hassas bir şekilde modellenmek zorundadır. Modelleme sırasında kirişler ve kolonlar çubuk <b>eleman</b> olarak modellenmektedirler, perdeler ise levha <b>eleman</b> kabul edilirler. Alternatif olarak ise perde elemanlar bazı basitleştirmeler sonucu çeşitli tekniklerle modellenebilmektedirler. Perdelerin modellenmesi için pek çok metot geliştirilmiştir. En bilinen modelleme metodu, geniş orta dikme kolon modelidir. Rijit kirişler ise, perdenin bulunduğu bölüm boyunca devam eder ve orta kolonun üst ucunda birleşirler. Bir diğer model, geniş orta dikme kolon modeline benzeyen gergili çerçeve modeldir. Orta dikme modelde bulunan elemanlara ek olarak yerleştirilmiş, uçlarında dönme serbestliği olduğu kabul edilen iki çapraz <b>eleman</b> perde alanının bir ucundan diğer ucuna kadar devam ederler. Bir başka modelde ise, perdenin her iki ucuna perde rijitliğinin yarısına sahip iki kolon <b>eleman</b> yerleştirilmesi ve perdenin kaldırılmasından ibarettir. Kolon elemanları üst noktalarından birbirine rijit bir kiriş bağlamaktadır. Bu tez kapsamında gerek perdelerin şekil yapısından ötürü, gerekse çerçeve sistemine uygunluğundan ötürü geniş orta dikme kolon modeli kullanılmıştır. Yapının modelleme metoduna karar verdikten sonra DOC 3 B programının sonuçlarının doğruluğu irdelenmiştir. Bunun için, hesap sonuçlarına güvenilen bir paket program, SAP 2000 kullanılmıştır. Doğrulama için her iki programda örnekler oluşturulmuş, hem statik hem de dinamik analiz sonuçları karşılaştırılmıştır. Oluşturulan örnek modellerden ilki tek katlı tek açıklıklı bir yapı, diğeri ise tez sırasında irdelenen düzensiz perdeli betonarme yapıdır. Statik analizler sonucunda kesit tesir değerleri ve deplasman değerleri, dinamik analizler sonucunda ise modlara ait titreşim periyotları yeter derecede yakın sonuçlar vermiştir. Program doğrulaması tamamlandıktan sonra yapı sistemi üç ayrı yapı modeli olarak tasarlanmış ve her bir modele sabit tek modlu itme analizi uygulanmıştır. Oluşturulan yapı modelleri, perdeye komşu olan kiriş ve döşemelerin farklı varyasyonlarından oluşmaktadır. Yapı modelleri hem x hem de y doğrultularında itme analizine tabi tutulmuş, simetrik olmayan doğrultularda her iki yönde itme analizi yapılmıştır. İtme analizleri sonucunda perde çevresinde meydana gelen döşeme boşluklarının, kat planındaki düzensizliklerin ve döşeme boşluğunu çevreleyen kirişlerin tasarımının yapıya olan etkileri incelenmiş, sonuçlar irdelenmiştir.

Alternatively shear walls can be simplified by making some adjustments {{so that they can be}} defined as frame models. There are lots of methods for modelling shear walls. The well - known method is wide column frame model. It is described as a frame model at the middle surface of the shear wall and two rigid horizontal element connect that frame member from the top point. This method can be desired because of adopting it into developed analysing programmes easily and provide saving time by reducing analysing procedure. On the other hand, this acceptance cause much more rolative errors when comparing to other methods. Users always should be aware of this rolative errors cannot be ignored. Second method,the braced frame model, have common properties with wide column frame model. In this method, frame also includes horizontally rigid arms and braces, but the central column of the previous frame is omitted and replaced by a column on one vertical edge and a hinged link on the other. The results compare in accuracy with simple rectangular plane stress finite elements [Stafford Smith, Amal Girgis]. The braced frame model is more efficient than the braced wide column and it is also more consistent and accurate. The real issue of this method rigidity of braces. Third method uses two column which has half of the bending rigidity of shear wall and located at starting and ending points of this element. These two column connected to each other by a beam that has a significant bending rigidity (about infinite). This method uses systems own nodal points. Therefore it can be used easily at the simplified frame analysing programmes. Disadvantage of this method, locating of colums cause moments return into axial forces at columns. Moreover, obtained bending moments values are lower than true values. In this thesis wide column method selected for shear wall solutions due to shape of shear wall (L shape). Therefore central column turns compatible with the system frames. Furthermore, decreasing alaysing steps provide saving important time. These model the fastest method for solving shear wall problems. There dimensional structures only defined by using two dimensional sub - systems in DOC 3 B. DOC 3 B firstly create rigidity and force matrices of two dimensional sub - systems. Then programme combines these matrixes into three dimensional rigidity and force matrices. Because of defining sub - systems, beams horizontal and vertical rigidity values; columns and shear walls every rigidity values at every vertical sub - system defined seperately. Material properties defined at a different file and assigned every member at the sub - systems. These provides user with calculate true capacity behavior during analysis procedure. After selecting solution method, it is have to shown that DOC 3 B gives high accurate results with a programme that analysis results are proved. Because of this reason, a worldwide known programme, SAP 2000 used in this thesis for comparison. Verifications made on two models that one of a simply frame model and other one is main model used in thesis. Besides two new specifications of DOC 3 B tested first time at this step. The first specification is defining uniform distributed load on frame elements. The second is set of equations at the direction of z. Moreover second specification also provide that assign loads at any direction. Firstly, vertical loads assigned frame members of models and a horizontal point load assigned just one point to cause torsion at the simple model. Bending moments, shear and axial forces and nodal points displacements compared after static analysis. These control parameters have nearly same values and displacement values proved occuring of torsion. Free vibration modes compared at the dynamic analysis step. According to analysis results first three mode found as 1. 873, 1. 368 and 0. 502 s by using DOC 3 B and 1. 880, 1. 372 and 0. 505 s by using SAP 2000. These results proved DOC 3 B gives accurate results. After linear analysis and proving DOC 3 B, nonlinear analysis is made for determining performance capacity of structure. Structural performance is defined by damages of structural members. General acceptance in performance based design provide life safety performance level after earthquakes that has a probability of exceedance of 10 %/ 50 years. Nonlinear push-over analysis apllied to the structural model for determining performance level. Turkish Seismic Code 2007 includes several nonlinear analysis procedures. These are incremental equivalant earthquake load method, incremental mode combining method and nonlinear time history analysis. Structural model pushed by using incremental equivalant earthquake load method in this study due to DOC 3 B has not coded for changable modes and nonlinear time history analysis yet. Nonlinear incremental push over analysis can be subjected to structures by using several methods. The simplest push over method is constant single mode push over. Force applied to the structural modal according to dominant mode. Until structure reaches the collapse mode, it is pushed. The other method is flexible single mode push over analysis. This method accepts building modes change after every pushing step. Pushing step increases when a structural member reach its own capacity. Therefore the force vector applied to the structural model has to be calculated at any pushing step. Because of structural model has irregularity, firstly it should be decided that which direction structural model pushed along. Because of that base shear forces and top displacements compared to each other at both directions (x and y). Comparisons showed, although pushig only one direction is enough at the direction of symmetry, structural model should be pushed at any direction at the non-symmetrical direction. Three different structural model created by making some changes in floor plan. First model has no changes in floor plan. The second model has floor gaps next to the shear walls. The third model, capacity of beams, which around the floor gaps, increase by using more wide dimensions. Incremental push over analysis performed on every model. After that performance analysis is made for structural elements chosen randomly. Results showed that floor gaps cause an incremantation at top displacement nevertheless when beam around the gaps changes with much more rigid elements this incrementation can be prevented. Modal capacity diagrams are the proof of this situation. Strains of structural elements have very small values so that when comparing the hazard levels there is no differences between three model. However when comparing the strain values instead of hazard levels, floor gaps cause an incremantation up to 100 %. This situation cause beams around the gaps reaches their capacities much more earlier and make shear walls independent members from whole structure. This situation shows that if there are floor gaps, beams around them should be more rigid to prevent torsion and also reaching structure s capacity. DOC 3 B, the programme used in this whole study, is still in development process. DOC 3 B able to cope with lineer and nonlineer analysis, push over analysis and can calculate strain and stress values at any cross - section. This provide user with making performance analysis easier and faster. The reasons of development of DOC 3 B is produce a programme that has specifications listed below; • Capable with nonlinear analysis much more easily • User friendly • Local producement • Can be rival to the other structural analysis programmes. However DOC 3 B still have some disadvantages like listed below; • it is not possible making time domain analysis • Only three degree of freedom can be defined at nodal points • Data inputting takes important time and it is highly possible making mistakes.
