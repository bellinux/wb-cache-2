40|$|The {{scientific}} goal of HANDS. DVI {{consists of}} developing a common framework to programming robotic hands independently from their kinematics, mechanical construction, and sensor equipment complexity. Recent results on {{the organization of the}} human hand in grasping and manipulation are the inspiration for this experiment. The reduced set of parameters that we effectively use to <b>control</b> our <b>hands</b> is known in the literature as the set of synergies. The synergistic organization of the human hand is the theoretical foundation of the innovative approach to design a unified framework for robotic <b>hands</b> <b>control.</b> Theoretical <b>tools</b> have been studied to design a suitable mapping function of the control action (decomposed in its elemental action) from a human hand model domain onto the articulated robotic hand co-domain. The developed control framework has been applied on an experimental set up consisting of two robotic hands with dissimilar kinematics grasping an object instrumented with force sensors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the plasticity {{of the body}} representation for action (Body Schema, BS) by studying tool-use in a deafferented patient, C. D., with a peripheral deafferentation of the right arm. We asked C. D. to grasp an object with both her right (deafferented) or left hand and a mechanical grab. We then analysed her kinematics. We found that double peaks of acceleration and velocity characterized the kinematic of the deafferented hand. The same kinematic profile was present when the same <b>hand</b> was <b>controlling</b> the <b>tool.</b> Moreover, the patient showed a relatively fast process of learning in using the tool, since the kinematics evolved during the training. This pattern was not present for the left hand as {{there was no difference}} between first and last block of movements, in line with what we showed in a previous study in normal subjects, who did not show motor learning in using the same tool. Finally, in the post-training, the deafferented hand showed a normal kinematic profile that was still present 6 months later. In conclusion, to use a grabber that normally does not imply motor learning, C. D. shows a process of motor learning that is likely guided by visual information and affects subsequent free-hand movement...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{device was}} {{developed}} {{that will allow}} laparoscopic surgeons to hand-operate standard electrosurgical equipment, eliminating the use of electrosurgical foot pedals, which typically cause static, unstable and non-neutral body positions. Accordingly, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the optimal ergonomic placement of the novel electrosurgical <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> integrated into a standard laparoscopic grasper to optimize functionality. Three distinct <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> designs were evaluated by 26 participants during the performance of four basic inanimate laparoscopic electrosurgical tasks. <b>Hand</b> <b>control</b> actuation force and user preference were evaluated for each <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> design. The results indicate that <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> design 1 (CD 1) resulted in the ability to generate significantly greater actuation force for three of the four tasks (P < 0. 05). Additionally, CD 1 was subjectively rated significantly better for comfort and ease-of-use compared to the other two <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> designs (P < 0. 05). As a result, CD 1 was determined to be an advantageous ergonomic design placement for the novel electrosurgical <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> integrated into a standard laparoscopic grasper.

40|$|Maintaining social {{stability}} {{is one of}} the major public goods provided by the government and is essential for the smooth operation of an economy. This research reveals the interactions of and factors affecting the demand for three important social <b>control</b> <b>tools,</b> namely, police, relief for the poor and primary education. A simultaneous model of five equations are estimated by Two-stage Least Squares and Three-stage Least Squares methods. We find that relief-for-the-poor factor behaves very similarly to the police factor. Primary education is complementary to the other two social <b>control</b> <b>tools,</b> while police and poor relief are substitutes for maintaining {{social stability}}. This interrelationship between social <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> implies that in dealing with social problems, decision-makers should contemplate an optimal combination of various social <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> instead of functioning in an ad hoc or piece-meal fashion. Moreover, knowing the factors affecting the demand for the social <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> is useful for policy making in the public sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to quantitatively and qualitatively {{determine}} the optimal ergonomic placement of novel electrosurgical <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> integrated into a standard laparoscopic grasper to optimize functionality. This device will allow laparoscopic surgeons to hand-operate standard electrosurgical equipment, eliminating the use of electrosurgical foot pedals, which are prone to activation errors and cause uncomfortable body positions for the physician. Three <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> designs were evaluated by 26 participants during the performance of four basic inanimate laparoscopic electrosurgical tasks. Task completion time, actuation force, forearm electromyography (EMG) and user preference were evaluated for each <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> design.

40|$|Background & objectives: Data on the {{physical}} dimension of the hand of Indian women are scanty. This information is necessary to ascertain human-machine compatibility {{in the design of}} manual systems for the bare and gloved hand, such as design and sizing of <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> <b>controls,</b> knobs and other applications in different kinds of precision and power grips. The present study was undertaken to generate hand anthropometric data of 95 women, working in informal industries (beedi, agarbatti and garment making). Methods: Fifty one hand measurements of the right hand (lengths, breadths, circumferences, depths, spreads and clearances of hand and fingers) were taken, using anthropometric sliding and spreading calipers, measuring tape and handgrip strength dynamometer. The data were statistically analyzed to determine the normality of data and the percentile values of different hand dimensions, and simple and multiple regression analysis were done to determine better predictors of hand length and grip strength. Results: The hand breadths, circumferences and depths were approximately normally distributed, with some deviation in case of the finger lengths. Hand length was significantly correlated with the fist, wrist and finger circumferences. The fist and wrist circumferences, in combination, were better predictors of hand length. The hand lengths, breadths and depths, including finger joints of the India...|$|R

40|$|The {{two main}} {{interventions}} presently being deployed {{for control of}} malaria vectors, that is, long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) involve the use of chemical insecticides and target adult mosquitoes. Meanwhile, the potential of larval control is increasingly being acknowledged for the reduction of insecticide-resistant and/or exophagic Anopheles populations. Larval control {{has proven to be}} cost-effective and ideal for localities where mosquito-breeding sites are well defined and approachable. Utilising biological <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> to <b>control</b> anopheline larvae can lower the problem of resistance development, a common feature of chemical control. Fortunately, there are many options of biological larval <b>control</b> <b>tools.</b> Besides their direct impact on mortality, the effects of these tools can reach beyond the larval stage. Anopheline adults that develop from larvae exposed to biological <b>control</b> <b>tools,</b> such as entomopathogenic fungi, show reduced longevity, fecundity and susceptibility to Plasmodium infections. Combining two or more larval <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> can increase their efficacy against anopheline larvae. However, despite the identification of larval control potential in the laboratory, and in few cases in the field, many potential biological <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> have not been utilised to their fullest extent. This review provides an overview of the existing and potential biological larval control options for malaria vectors and discusses the advantages and requirements to develop them for malaria vector control...|$|R
