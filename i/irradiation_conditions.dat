The {{accumulation of gas}} in the material microstructure is intimately related to {{the energy of the}} colliding neutrons. Due to the sensitivity of materials to the specificities in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as the α-particle generation/dpa ratio at damage levels above 15 dpa per year of operation under temperature controlled conditions, material tests require the neutron source to be comparable to a fusion reactor environment.|$|E

However, the {{incremental conductance}} method can produce oscillations (unintentionally) and can perform erratically under rapidly changing atmospheric conditions.

50|$|Ion beam {{analysis}} {{works on}} the basis that ion-atom interactions are produced by the introduction of ions to the sample being tested. Major interactions result in the emission of products that enable information regarding the number, type, distribution and structural arrangement of atoms to be collected. To use these interactions to determine sample composition a technique must be selected along with <b>irradiation</b> <b>conditions</b> and the detection system that will best isolate the radiation of interest providing the desired sensitivity and detection limits. The basic layout of a ion beam apparatus is an accelerator which produces an ion beam that is feed through an evacuated beam-transport tube to a beam handling device. This device isolates the ion species and charge of interest which then are transported through an evacuated beam-transport tube into the target chamber. This chamber is where the refined ion beam will come into contact with the sample and thus the resulting interactions can be observed. The configuration of the ion beam apparatus can be changed and made more complex with the incorporation of additional components. The techniques for ion beam analysis are designed for specific purposes. Some techniques and ion sources are shown in table 1. Detector types and arrangements for ion beam techniques are shown in table 2.|$|E
