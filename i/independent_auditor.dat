25|$|On May 15, 2007, NetBank {{received}} a warning from the Nasdaq stock market {{because it was}} late in filing its most recent quarterly report. NetBank {{received a}} similar notice from Nasdaq in March 2007 because it did not file its 2006 annual report on time. The report was delayed because the company needed to find a new <b>independent</b> <b>auditor</b> following the resignation of Ernst & Young LLP in November 2006. NetBank hired Porter Keadle Moore LLP as its new <b>independent</b> <b>auditor</b> in February 2007. NetBank said it planned to file the annual and quarterly reports by the end of June 2007.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{autonomous}} {{regulatory agencies}} {{for water and}} sanitation in Germany at the state or federal level. The recently created federal regulatory agency for network industries (Bundesnetzagentur) covers telecommunications, postal services, electricity, gas and rail. It does not cover water supply and sanitation, since it is a responsibility of the states. Water and sanitation tariffs are approved through different procedures in each state, usually by a department in the state Ministry of Economy after {{a review of the}} tariff increase request by an <b>independent</b> <b>auditor.</b> In city-states (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen) this means that the Minister (called Senator) of Economy both requests the tariff increase in his capacity as {{chairman of the board of}} the utility and also approves it, which constitutes a conflict of interest. In the case of some private utilities, tariffs are set by a mutually agreed arbitrator based on the professional opinion of an auditor.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, NetBank {{recognized}} {{that there were}} some significant operating deficiencies and started to restructure the company in an effort to resume profitability. The company shut down or sold several businesses. Some of the shuttered companies included FTI, payroll and finance services, non-auto (RV, boat and aircraft) loans and the subprime/non-conforming mortgage companies. The <b>independent</b> <b>auditor,</b> Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the open markets. Some of the loans that NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks. Since the loans that did not meet the underwriting guidelines were often past-due loans, NetBank was forced to repurchase a many failed loans that it had written. This loss of capital was very harmful to the company's equity position and was the first clue to the bank's poor financial position.|$|E
25|$|May 27 – The Manila Electric Company {{held its}} tension-filled annual {{stockholders}} meeting, which lasted {{for more than}} 13 hours, making it the longest stockholders' meeting in Philippine corporate history. The {{head of the state}} pension fund Government Service Insurance System Winston Garcia filed a motion to the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend the stockholders' meeting after it questioned the proxy votes in favor of the Lopez family. The MERALCO board proceeded with the company's stockholders' meeting, defying a cease and desist order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it questioned the authenticity of the injunction order. After the rally and resistance of the stockholders against the bloc of Winston Garcia, the Lopez family retained control of MERALCO. The stockholders awarded five board seats to its representatives and only four seats to the representatives of the government. It took <b>independent</b> <b>auditor</b> SGV and Co. seven hours to come out with the results of the voting.|$|E
500|$|Days {{prior to}} this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that [...] "there is no {{precedent}} where government will go after people for costs just because they have {{money to pay for}} it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for", although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an <b>independent</b> <b>auditor</b> to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, [...] "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong". Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.|$|E

2500|$|One area {{of concern}} is whether the {{auditing}} firm acts as both the <b>independent</b> <b>auditor</b> and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This {{may result in a}} conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an <b>independent</b> <b>auditor.</b> [...] Changes enacted in the United States {{in the form of the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the Enron scandal) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.|$|E

2500|$|Frank Dunn {{presided over}} a {{dramatic}} restructuring of Nortel, which included laying off two-thirds of its workforce (60,000 staff) and writedowns of nearly US$16 billion in 2001 alone. This had some initial perceived success in turning the company around, with an unexpected return to profitability reported {{in the first quarter}} of 2003. The black ink triggered a total of $70 million in bonuses to the top 43 managers, with $7.8 million going to Dunn alone, $3 million to chief financial officer Douglas Beatty, and $2 million to controller Michael Gollogly. <b>Independent</b> <b>auditor</b> Deloitte & Touche advised audit committee chairman John Cleghorn and board chairman [...] "Red" [...] Wilson to look into the suspicious results, who promptly hired the law firm WilmerHale to vet the financial statements. In late October 2003, Nortel announced that it intended to restate approximately $900 million of liabilities carried on its previously reported balance sheet as of June 30, 2003, following a comprehensive internal review of these liabilities. The company stated that the restatement's principal effects would be a reduction in previously reported net losses for 2000, 2001, and 2002 and an increase in shareholders’ equity and net assets previously reported on its balance sheet. A dozen of the company's most senior executives returned $8.6 million of bonuses they were paid based on the erroneous accounting. Investigators ultimately found about $3 billion in revenue had been booked improperly in 1998, 1999, and 2000. More than $2 billion was moved into later years, about $750 million was pushed forward beyond 2003 and about $250 million was wiped away completely. The accounting scandal hurt both Nortel's reputation and finances, as Nortel spent an estimated US$400 million on outside auditors and management consultants to retrain staff.|$|E
