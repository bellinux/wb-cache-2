Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar chemical structure nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects via α2 and α3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α5 subsite), as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the <b>hypnotic</b> <b>action</b> of NMDA antagonist and GABA agonist general anaesthetics could be explained by cerebrocortical suppression of astrocyte function. To this end, we first sought to identify in cortical slices a robust correlate of in vivo hypnotic potency—and found that the magnitude of the reduction in SLE frequency in slices correlated well with the ability of each test drug to induce hypnosis in vivo. With this as a comparator, we then determined the effect of astrocyte metabolic inhibition on cortical slice SLE activity. We reasoned that if anaesthetic suppression of astrocyte activity mediates the <b>hypnotic</b> <b>action</b> of these drugs, then targeted astrocyte inhibition in slices should be apparent as a reduction in SLE frequency. This was clearly not the case—we observed the opposite effect, with enhancement of SLE activity for both pharmacologically distinct astrocyte inhibitors. Additionally, if astrocyte suppression explains anaesthetic hypnosis, we might expect a profound synergy between astrocytic metabolic inhibitors and the response to propofol and etomidate, which was not observed. Accordingly, our results do not support the hypothesis that suppression of astrocytes is a mechanism of anaesthetic hypnosis. While the experimental design of this study indirectly probed the relationship between anaesthetic effects on astrocytes and anaesthetic hypnosis, the logic is clear—if hypnotic anaesthetic action is robustly associated with suppression of SLEs; and astrocyte inhibition has the opposite effect; then astrocyte inhibition is unlikely to be a major component contributing to anaesthetic hypnosis.|$|E

Consequently, although etomidate enhances inhibition in both neuronal types, the effect of this anesthetic on the tonic conductance of VB neurons is dominant. The GABA-enhancing actions of etomidate in VB but not nRT neurons are greatly suppressed by the � 2 N 265 S mutation. The hypnotic THIP (Gaboxadol) induces SWA and at low, clinically relevant concentrations (30 nM to 3 �M) increases the tonic conductance of VB neurons, with no effect on VB or nRT miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) or on the holding current of nRT neurons. Zolpidem, which has no effect on SWA, prolongs VB mIPSCs but is ineffective on the phasic and tonic conductance of nRT and VB neurons, respectively.

It has been widely used in psychiatry disorders for four decades, with selective anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and <b>hypnotic</b> <b>actions.</b> It acts on the central neural system as an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). (Guilherme Nobre Lima do Nascimento et al. 2012) It is a drug that belongs to class of 1, 4 -benzodiazepine and chemically corresponds to 7 -bromo- 1, 3 -dihydro- 5 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2 H- 1, 4 -benzodiazepine- 2 -one, C₁₄H₁₀BrN₃O. (Ph. Eur 7 th, 2010). It is a controlled psychotropic substance-B 1 class according National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance in Brazil (ANVISA), with the DCB identification numbers: 01366, DCI: 2692 and CAS: 1812 - 20 - 2. The solid form is the widespread used and prescribed in clinical practice. The solid form shows problems associated to the bioavailability, (FDA, 2003) indeed; the absorption of oral drugs in the solid form depends on the solubility and dissolution in physiologic liquids and its permeability through the gastrointestinal tract, factors that influence directly its bioavailability and subsequent pharmacological effects. The biotransformation from solid into absorbable form depends on its dissolution in organic liquids; therefore, dissolution tests became an essential parameter to determine the properties of biopharmaceutical formulations in order to predict their quality. The quality of pharmaceutical formulations is important in financial and ethical terms because it is directly associated with the patient’s health. Thus, there is a real need for the development of dissolution tests able to predict in vivo physiological behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} a number of centrally acting drugs have been compared in euthyroid mice and mice made hyperthyroid by pretreatment with sodium- 1 -thyroxine. The potencies of two barbiturates, pentobarbitone and thiopentone - as indicated by the duration of their <b>hypnotic</b> <b>actions</b> and their acute toxicities - are increased in hyperthyroid mice. An acutely active uncoupler of phosphorylative oxidation is 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, an agent which proved to be a potent hypnotic when administered intracerebrally. An attempt has been made to relate the mechanism of action of the barbiturates to the uncoupling effects of thyroxine and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. The pharmacological effects of chlorpromazine, reserpine and amphetamine-like drugs have also been studied in hyperthyroid mice. After pretreatment with thyroxine, mice show a reduced tendency to become hypothermic after chlorpromazine or reserpine; in fact, under suitable laboratory conditions these agents produce a hyperthermic effect. Yet their known depressant effects upon locomotor activity were not substantially altered. Thus it appeared that depression of locomotor activity and hypothermia are not necessarily correlated, an observation at variance with previously held opinion. These results have been discussed in the light of our knowledge {{of the role of the}} thyroid gland in thermoregulation. The actions of tremorine and its metabolite, oxotremorine, have also been examined. Hyperthyroid animals are less susceptible to both the hypothermia and tremor produced by these agents. An attempt is made to explain these observations, in view of the known mechanism of action of oxotremorine and the tremorgenic actions that thyroxine may have.

HcrtR antagonists are hypothesized to induce sleep by disfacilitation of wake-promoting systems whereas GABAA receptor modulators such as zolpidem (ZOL) induce sleep through general inhibition of neural activity. To test the hypothesis that less functional impairment results from HcrtR antagonist-induced sleep, we evaluated the performance of rats in the Morris Water Maze in the presence of ALM vs. ZOL. Performance in spatial reference memory (SRM) and spatial working memory (SWM) tasks were assessed during the dark period after equipotent sleep-promoting doses (100 mg/kg, po) following undisturbed and sleep deprivation (SD) conditions. ALM-treated rats were indistinguishable from vehicle (VEH) -treated rats for all SRM performance measures (distance travelled, latency to enter, time within, and number of entries into, the target quadrant) after both the undisturbed and 6 h SD conditions. In contrast, rats administered ZOL showed impairments in all parameters measured compared to VEH or ALM in the undisturbed conditions. Following SD, ZOL-treated rats also showed impairments in all measures. ALM-treated rats were similar to VEH-treated rats for all SWM measures (velocity, time to locate the platform and success rate at finding the platform within 60 s) after both the undisturbed and SD conditions. In contrast, ZOL-treated rats showed impairments in velocity and in the time to locate the platform. Importantly, ZOL rats only completed the task 23 - 50 % of the time while ALM and VEH rats completed the task 79 - 100 % of the time. Thus, following equipotent sleep-promoting doses, ZOL impaired rats in both memory tasks while ALM rats performed at levels comparable to VEH rats.

Thus, there is a real need for the development of dissolution tests able to predict in vivo physiological behavior. The present study is focused on minimizing limitations and developing a simple, precise, accurate and economic method for estimation of Bromazepam in tablet dosage forms. Dissolution test is a standardized method for measuring the rate of drug release from a dosage form. For dissolution medium 0. 1 M HCl was chosen, in volume of 500 ml, at 37 ºC, performed on ERWEKA DT 700, apparatus 2 (paddle), with 75 rpm for 45 minutes. An analytical method for Dissolution by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique was validated for content of Bromazepam and the validation was carried out on Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system. To optimize chromatographic parameters several mobile phase compositions were tested. A satisfactory separation, good peak symmetry and optimal retention time was obtained with mobile phase consisting a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (KH₂PO₄) (pH 7. 0; 11. 33 g/l KH₂PO₄) in ratio of 45 : 5 : 50 (v/v/v) that was set at flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min was found to be optimum and further optimized by adjusting pH 7. 0 by adding KOH 0. 5 M.

40|$|Alcohol {{tolerance}} {{resulting from}} chronic administration {{is well known}} {{to be accompanied by}} cross-tolerance to sedative/anesthetic drugs, especially those acting on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs). Rats treated with chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) show decreased function and altered pharmacology of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons, consistent with cell- and location-specific changes in GABAAR subunit composition. We previously observed variably altered sensitivity to GABAergic drugs in vivo and in hippocampal neurons using whole cell patch-clamp recording in brain slices. Here, we examined additional clinical GABAergic drugs to correlate CIE-induced tolerance to potentiation of neuronal GABAAR-mediated currents with tolerance of these agents to sedative/anesthetic effects in vivo. Typical of several drug classes and two cell types, in CA 1 pyramidal neurons, the benzodiazepine diazepam doubled the total charge transfer (TCT) of miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents (mIPSCs), whereas it quadrupled the TCT of tonic currents. CIE treatment altered these responses to variable extent, as it did to loss of righting reflex (LORR) induced by these same drugs: 90 – 95 % tolerance to flurazepam, the neuroactive steroid alphaxalone, and ethanol; 30 – 40 % to pentobarbital, etomidate, and the GABA agonist gaboxadol; and no tolerance to propofol. There was a strong correlation between tolerance in the LORR assay and tolerance to enhancement of tonic currents, but not mIPSCs. The striking correlation suggests that the sedative/anesthetic actions of GABAergic drugs may be mediated primarily via the potentiation of extrasynaptic GABAARs.

It reverses the effects of BDZs in vivo and in vitro, but also has intrinsic activity, as it loweres the seizure threshold to drugs antagonistic to the action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The other compound, an imidazodiazepine (Ro 15 - 1788), which is also a potent and specific antagonist of BDZ binding in vivo and in vitro, blocked the sedative, <b>hypnotic</b> and anticonvulsant <b>actions</b> of conventional BDZs, without demonstrating any intrinsic activity. Because of the different profiles of action of these two BDZ 'antagonists', we have here investigated their interactions in two well established systems for assessing BDZ activity: seizure thresholds in vivo and the action of GABA on cervical sympathetic ganglia in vitro. We find that Ro 15 - 1788 not only opposes the actions of BDZs but also is an effective antagonist of β-CCE in both systems. At high doses it has BDZ-like activity, suggesting that it may be a partial agonist at the BDZ receptor site...|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} carried out in two parts. Firstly, we {{utilised}} a range of chemically related ketamine-ester analogues shown to have widely varying in vivo hypnotic potencies—and identified in cortical slices the field potential correlates of the in vivo hypnotic effect. We found that the in vivo hypnotic potency of the ketamine-esters correlated with their ability to reduce the frequency of zero-magnesium seizure-like events (SLEs) in the slice. Propofol and etomidate—drugs which are thought to act on a different family of receptors to ketamine—were also shown to have dose-dependent inhibitory effects on SLE frequency, in dose ranges consistent with their relative clinical potencies for inducing hypnosis. This is in agreement with previous studies (Voss et al. 2012) and indicates that a reduction in SLE frequency is the pathognomonic signature of anaesthetic <b>hypnotic</b> <b>action</b> in cortical brain slices. With this as a basis, we hypothesised {{in the second part of}} this paper that if astrocyte inhibition is sufficient to cause hypnosis during anaesthesia, then inhibition of astrocyte function in the cortical slice model should result in a decrease in SLE frequency.|$|E
40|$|Hypnotic {{drugs are}} known to possess {{antiepileptic}} activity. Therefore, {{the effects of the}} benzodiazepine hypnotic midazolam (10 mg/kg) and the novel imidazopyridine hypnotic zolpidem (10 mg/kg) on sleep-wake states and on the number of spike-wave discharges were evaluated in WAG/Rij rats. Rats of this strain are considered to be a model for generalized absence epilepsy. Animals were implanted with chronic monopolar EEG electrodes and, after recovery from surgery, the EEG was recorded for 6 h during the dark period on 3 consecutive days. Sleep recordings were analyzed using Hjorth's parameters and number and duration of spike-wave discharges were visually determined. It was found that both drugs facilitated nonREM sleep at the cost of wakefulness. Both hypnotics also reduced the number and duration of spike-wave discharges. The initial decrease after midazolam, however, was followed by a rebound reflecting a poorer quality of vigilance expressed as an increase in spike-wave discharges. The strong antiabsence activity of zolpidem mimics that of midazolam and is well correlated with their equipotent <b>hypnotic</b> <b>action</b> and anticonvulsant effect in the isoniazid test...|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{anticonvulsant}} activity {{within the}} series of 5 -phenyl- 5 -alkyl barbituric acids {{was found to be}} exhibited by the butyl derivative in the study of Alles, Effis, Feigen and Redemann (1). This phenyl butyl barbituric acid exerted markedly less <b>hypnotic</b> <b>action</b> than related derivatives having more moderate anticonvulsive effectiveness. However, it now appears that the low solubiity in water of the free phenyl butyl barbituric acid makes oral administra-tion of this compound, even in the form of its sodium salt, only partially effective as compared with its effectiveness when injected intraperitoneally as a solution of the sodium salt. After oral administration of the sodium salt into the stomach a considerable amount of the salt is converted into the relatively insoluble free acid from reaction with the resting hydrochloric acid of the stomach or neutral buffering systems of the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. To search for compounds that might have greater water solubiity, yet share with phenyl butyl barbituric acid its relatively high anticonvulsive effectiveness, study was extended to the phenyl unsaturated-alkyl barbituric acids.

40|$|BACKGROUND: γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors {{mediate the}} actions of several {{intravenous}} general anesthetics. However, the contribution of α 3 -containing GABAA receptors to the action of these drugs is unknown. METHODS: The authors compared anesthetic endpoints (hypnosis, immobility, hypothermia) in response to various intravenous anesthetics in mice lacking the α 3 subunit of the GABAA receptor (α 3 knockout) and in wild-type mice. Furthermore, the authors generated and analyzed conditional mutant mice expressing the GABAA receptor α 3 subunit exclusively in noradrenergic neurons. RESULTS: α 3 knockout mice displayed decreased hypnotic and hypothermic responses to etomidate and midazolam, but an increased response to pentobarbital. The hypnotic response to ketamine was unaltered, whereas the hypothermic response was increased. In contrast, the hypnotic but not the hypothermic response to medetomidine was increased. The combination of ketamine/xylazine displayed increased hypnotic, immobilizing, and hypothermic effects in α 3 knockout mice. Mice expressing the α 3 subunit exclusively in noradrenergic neurons were generated to assess whether the lack of α 3 subunits on noradrenergic neurons {{may be responsible for}} this effect. In these mice, the increases of the <b>hypnotic</b> and immobilizing <b>actions</b> induced by ketamine/xylazine were largely absent, whereas the increase in the hypothermic action was still present. CONCLUSION: α 3 -containing GABAA receptors bidirectionally regulate essential anesthetic actions: they mediate anesthetic actions of etomidate and midazolam, known to selectively act at GABAA receptors, and they negatively constrain anesthetic actions of compounds with targets partly or exclusively distinct from GABAA receptors such as medetomidine, ketamine, and pentobarbital. Furthermore, our results indicate that α 3 -containing GABAA receptors on noradrenergic neurons may contribute to this constraint...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} drugs is intimately woven with plants from {{earliest}} times, {{and even today}} plant products find extensive use in both traditional and modern systems of medicine. Indeed, many drugs including morphine, cocaine, reserpine, quinine, digitalis, atropine, vincristine, and vinbalstine are {{a few examples of}} pure chemicals; some used clinically, others used as tools for understand ling the mechanism of action of action of other drugs. Beside pure chemicals herbal mixtures are also used in developing countries. In Nigeria, the extract of roots of Rauwolfia serpentine (Apocynaceae family) has been used as sedative hypnotic, in epilepsy and anxiety state (Srivasta, 1987). More recently other species of Rauwolfia have demonstrated sedative (Madawala, et al. 1994) and antipsychotic effect Obembe, et. Al 1994). The extract of Rauwolfia vomitaria is successfully used for treatment of psychiatric illnesses. In the present studies, we selected Nerium oleander, a plant of the same family that has been extensively studied for cardiovascular (Nazar, et. al., 1970), hepatoprotective (Fengbi, et. al 1989), diuretic (Takahashi, 1948), hypoglycemic (jalil et al. 1986), and many other activities. However, its effects on behavior on central nervous system (CNS) has not been studied. The study was carried out to observe the effects of various crude, partially purified fractions and pure constituents on behavior pattern in mice. The results showed that fractions of the leaves extract induced sedation at low dose and hypnosis at high doses which was an evidence of their effect on the CNS. Many of the known sedative <b>hypnotics</b> exert their <b>action</b> by modifying GABA-ergic system in the CNS (Lundberg, et. Al, 1975). The fractions were further studied using various parameters indicative of CNS activity. These included locomotor studies, motor coordination /muscle relaxation and interaction with hexobarbital antagonism to known convulsants; studies of the effect of extract on amino acid neurotransmitters were also performed. The results of these studies showed a significant decreased in locomotion counts, decrease in motor performance and enhancement of heoxbarbital sleeping time. Our findings indicated that these fractions act by facilitation of GABA-Ergic transmission. Furthermore, behavioral effects of GABA agonists exhibited sedation hypo motility and impairment of motor execution (Loschoer, et. Al, 1989). Muscimol and THIP, both GABA agonists, have been reported to potentiate Phenobarbital hypnosis (Evans, Hill, 1978, Sivam, et. al., 1982). Targeting further into the mechanism/s of action we studied the effect of these fractions on drug induced convulsions. For this purpose we used three GABA antagonists PTZ, bicuculline and picrotoxin and one glycine antagonist strychnine. One of the fractions N- 1 of Nerium oleander leaves completely blocked the convulsions induced by GABA receptor antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin but not those induced by strychnine, a glycine antagonist or PTZ. Some other fractions showed 40 - 60 % protection against convulsions induced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are known to antagonize convulsions (Guidotti, et. al, 19983), whereas diazepam blocks the convulsions induced by picrotoxin and bicuculline {{and to a lesser extent}} those induced by strychnine(Curtis, et. al., 1976.) These findings suggest that the fractions act by altering the GABA ergic system in the CNS. To find out the possible mechanism/s neurotransmitter amino acid levels were determined in discrete brain regions of both treated and control mice. The results of these studies showed a significant decrease in glutamate and an increased in cortical GABA levels. Similar results have been reported by vernadakis, Woodbury, (1990) with DPH in rats. Benzodiazepine and barbiturate have been reported to decrease aspartate and glutamate levels (Chapman, et. al,. 1978, Carlson, chapman, 1981) This study demonstrated for the first time the sedative/ hypnotic effects in the leaves extract/ fractions of Nerium oleander (Zia, et. al., 1993, 1995) and sedative activity in pure constituents (Siddiqui et. al., accepted 1997). It also suggests that the fractions exert their effects possible by modifying GABA-ergi...|$|R
