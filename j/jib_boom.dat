5|$|The {{next three}} British ships, Vanguard {{in the lead}} {{followed}} by HMS Minotaur and HMS Defence, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship's fire on Spartiate, while Captain Thomas Louis in Minotaur attacked the unengaged Aquilon and Captain John Peyton in Defence joined the attack on Peuple Souverain. With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic, passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain Henry Darby on Bellerophon missed his intended anchor near Franklin and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain George Blagdon Westcott on Majestic also missed his station and almost collided with Heureux, coming under heavy fire from Tonnant. Unable to stop in time, Westcott's <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> became entangled with Tonnants shroud.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood's {{attack was}} so {{successful}} that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing {{the speed at which}} Decrés could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged. British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorcas warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant, who lay some distance to leeward. By 05:00, Dixon was close enough to engage, passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell, Lion crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the <b>jib</b> <b>boom,</b> allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow, raking the French ship from one end while Penelope did the same to the other. During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tells rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the slipway was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter <b>jib</b> <b>boom,</b> along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E

25|$|Wasp, {{under the}} command of Master Commandant Jacob Jones {{continued}} to operate along the coast of the middle states after the United States went to war with Britain in June 1812. Her single action came in October. On 13 October, she sailed from the Delaware River and two days later encountered a heavy gale that tore away her <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> and also washed two crewmen overboard. The following evening, Wasp encountered a squadron of ships and, {{in spite of the fact}} that two of their number appeared to be large men-of-war, made for them straight away. She finally caught the enemy convoy the following morning and discovered six merchantmen under the protection of a 22-gun sloop-of-war, HMS Frolic.|$|E
500|$|At 06:15, Nymphe {{was in a}} {{position}} to begin the engagement and opened fire with the port broadside against the starboard quarter of the French ship, to which Cléopâtre responded in kind. The two ships kept up a heavy cannonade for the next fifteen minutes at extreme close range before the French ship suddenly hauled up at 06:30. This gave Pellew the opportunity to engage the enemy even more closely and by 07:00 the French wheel had been destroyed, four successive helmsmen killed and the mizenmast snapped off [...] above the deck. This damage caused the French ship to swing around wildly, first to port and then suddenly back to starboard into Nymphe, so that the <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> came to rest between the fore and main masts of the British ship, exerting significant pressure on the mainmast, already weakened by French shot, before the <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> eventually snapped off. Mullon gave orders for his men to storm Nymphe while the ships were entangled, but his crew refused. As they hesitated, Cléopâtre swung back so that the frigates lay side by side, bow to stern, with Nymphe continuing the heavy cannonade as the British maintopmen worked furiously to disentangle the French rigging from their own ship's damaged mainmast, Pellew encouraging them with a promise of ten guineas to the man who successfully separated the ships. The British captain had initially been concerned that the collision was a deliberate manoeuvre from Mullon and had readied his men in case the French should launch a boarding attack on his frigate. However, as soon as it became clear that the movement was involuntary and that the French were unwilling to press an attack, Pellew reversed his orders and had the men he had assembled to repel boarders climb on board Cléopâtre instead.|$|E
500|$|Warrior began a refit in November 1864 {{during which}} the Armstrong guns, which had not proved {{successful}} in use, were removed and her armament was upgraded to the latest rifled muzzle-loading guns. She was recommissioned in 1867, {{under the command of}} Captain John Corbett, to relieve her sister as the guardship at Queenstown in Ireland, but instead both ships participated in the Fleet Review held on 17 July in honour of the visits made by the Khedive of Egypt and the Sultan of Turkey to Britain. After the review, the Admiralty paid off the ship on 24 July; the following day Warrior was recommissioned with Captain Henry Boys in command. After working up at Spithead, she sailed to join the Channel Squadron on 24 September. At {{the end of the year}} she was deployed to Osborne Bay to guard Queen Victoria at Osborne House. The Fenian Rising was under way, and there was intelligence suggesting that the Queen might be in danger from Irish nationalists. While Warrior was performing this duty, she received an informal visit from the Queen. The ship was part of a squadron that escorted the royal yacht [...] to Dublin in April 1868 for an official visit by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. In August, while cruising to Scotland, Warrior collided with , losing her figurehead and <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> and smashing Royal Oaks cutter. Boys was court-martialled and acquitted over the incident.|$|E
50|$|A {{jib crane}} {{is a type}} of crane where a {{horizontal}} member (<b>jib</b> or <b>boom),</b> supporting a moveable hoist, is fixed to a wall or to a floor-mounted pillar. Jib cranes are used in industrial premises and on military vehicles. The jib may swing through an arc, to give additional lateral movement, or be fixed. Similar cranes, often known simply as hoists, were fitted {{on the top floor of}} warehouse buildings to enable goods to be lifted to all floors.|$|R
50|$|The Ljungström rig {{was easy}} to handle but got no more {{widespread}} among sailboat manufacturers as sailing at full and broad reach were less efficient than rigs with a <b>jib</b> and <b>boom</b> that provides a better air flow. Contemporary tests of Swedish, Norwegian and Swedish yacht club showed Ljungström rig superior in full run and close reach, where it also gave higher altitude against the wind. The Royal Yacht Squadron in England equipped two boats of the type Redwing with Ljungström rigs to match them against the conventional rigged Redwings. The races that could be completed showed an advantage to Ljungström's rig.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{addressing}} the mobility problems {{introduced by the}} previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf.J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf.H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain. On reasonably level ground, hand operation at 4 seconds to traverse to 12.5° and 29.5 seconds to traverse to 120° was achieved. The resulting space was later used for the installation of an auxiliary [...] fuel tank; road range was thereby increased to , The remaining pistol and vision ports on the turret side hatches were removed, and the engine's radiator housing was simplified by changing the slanted sides to straight sides. Three sockets with screw threads for mounting a 2-ton <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> crane were welded on the turret roof while the hull roof was thickened from [...] to [...] In addition, the cylindrical muffler was replaced by two flame-suppressing mufflers. On June 1944 Wa Prüf 6 had decided that because bomb damage at Panzerfirma Krupp in Essen had seriously jeopardized tank production, all plates which should have been face-hardened for the Panzer IV were instead made with rolled homogeneous armour plate. By late 1944, Zimmerit was no longer being applied to German armored vehicles, and the Panzer IV's side-skirts {{had been replaced by}} wire mesh, while the gunner's forward vision port in the turret front was eliminated and the number of return rollers was reduced from four to three to further speed-up production.|$|E

On 30 January 1952, the 800-ton tanker [...] collided with Cutty Sarks bow in the Thames. The two ships were locked together after the collision [...] which forced Cutty Sarks <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> [...] into Worcesters fo'c's'le rails, snapping the boom before scraping along Worcesters starboard side. Cutty Sarks figurehead lost an arm in the process. Cutty Sark was anchored and towed to the Shadwell Basin where repairs were carried out by Green & Silley Weir Ltd. The damaged arm was recovered at Grays Thurrock and the figurehead was repaired.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{design is}} {{believed}} to be due to Christian Bergh. She had a hermaphrodite rig, i.e., she combined the rigs of a schooner and a brigantine. [...] "She carried four sails on the foremast, one square sail on the main, and a large fore-and-aft sail with gaff abaft the fore, with large staysails over and three <b>jibs.</b> Her spanker <b>boom</b> projected far beyond the stern." ...|$|R
50|$|Ships with {{somewhat}} similar rigs {{were in fact}} recorded in Holland during the 17th century. These early Bermuda rigged boats evidently lacked <b>jibs</b> or <b>booms,</b> and the masts appear {{not to have been}} as robust as they were to become (a boat rigged with a Bermuda or gaff mainsail and no jib would today be known as a catboat). In 1675, Samuel Fortrey, of Kew, wrote to the naval administrator and Member of Parliament, Samuel Pepys, a treatise entitled Of Navarchi, suggesting the improvement of the Bermoodn rig {{with the addition of a}} boom, but evidently nothing came of this. Bermudian builders did introduce these innovations themselves, though when they first appeared has been lost to record.|$|R
50|$|In cinematography, a <b>jib</b> is a <b>boom</b> {{device with}} a camera on one end, and a {{counterweight}} and camera controls on the other. It operates like a see-saw, but with the balance point located close to the counterweight, so that the camera end of the arm can move through an extended arc. A jib permits the camera to be moved vertically, horizontally, {{or a combination of}} the two. A jib is often mounted on a tripod or similar support.|$|R
2500|$|Captain John McArthur Jr., of Michigan, {{ordered the}} thick towing hawser pulled in within hailing {{distance}} of Drake to communicate their status by shouts amplified with a megaphone. It {{was decided that}} Michigans crew would be removed in the pitch black night as {{there was no chance}} of launching Michigans yawl in the prevailing winds. Michigan was drawn up to Drake so that her bow was up against Drakes stern quarter on the leeward side. With the two wooden hulls grinding against each other, the crew of Michigan leaped to Drake when the waves brought the two decks level to one another. Just as the last of the Michigans crew were safely transferred to Drake, the wind carried Michigan into a sea trough causing her <b>jib</b> <b>boom</b> that jutted forward from her forepeak to rake across length of Drake.

50|$|A {{sailing vessel}} is hove to {{when it is}} at or nearly at rest because the driving action from one or more sails is {{approximately}} balanced by the drive from the other(s). This always involves 'backing' one or more sails, so that the wind is pressing against the forward side of the cloth, rather than the aft side as it normally would for the sail to drive the vessel forwards. On large square rigged, multi-masted vessels the procedures can be quite complex and varied, but on a modern two-sailed sloop, there is only the jib and the mainsail. A cutter may {{have more than one}} headsail, and a ketch, yawl or schooner may have more than one sail on a boom. In what follows, the <b>jibs</b> and <b>boomed</b> sails on such craft can either be treated as one of each, or lowered for the purposes of reduced windage, heel or complexity when heaving to for any length of time.|$|R
50|$|In 1790, ice {{yachting}} was {{in vogue}} on the Hudson River, its headquarters being at Poughkeepsie, New York. The type was a square box on three runners, the two forward, ones being {{nailed to the}} box and the third acting as a rudder operated by a tiller. The sail was a flatheaded sprit. This primitive style was in general use until 1853, when triangular frames with boxes for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig were introduced. A heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short gaffs, low sails, large <b>jibs</b> and <b>booms</b> extending far over the stern. It was over-canvassed and the mast was stepped directly over the runner plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the boats were apt to run away, and the over-canvassing frequently caused the windward runner to swing {{up into the air}} to a dangerous height. The largest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879, was Commodore J. A. Roosevelt's first Icicle, which measured 69 ft overall and carried 1070 sq ft of canvas. In 1879, H. Relyea built the Robert Scott, which had a single backbone and guy wires, and it became the model for all Hudson River ice yachts. Masts were now stepped farther forward, <b>jibs</b> were shortened, <b>booms</b> were cut down, and the center of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing the centers of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The shallow steering-box became elliptical. In 1881 occurred the first race for the American Challenge Pennant, which represents the championship of the Hudson River; the clubs that competed included the Hudson River, North Shrewsbury, Orange Lake, Newburgh and Carthage Ice Yacht Clubs. The races are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg measures one mile, {{at least two of the}} legs being to windward. Ice yachts are divided into four classes, carrying respectively 600 sq ft of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and less than 300 sq ft. Ice yachting is very popular on the Great Lakes, both in the United States and Canada, the Kingston, Ontario Club having a fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centers of the sport are the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area, with an average of twenty-five sailing days a season for the last five years, Lakes Minnetonka and White Bear in Minnesota, Lakes Winnebago and Pepin in Wisconsin, Bar Harbor Lake in Maine, the St. Lawrence River, Quinte Bay and Lake Champlain.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The study involves: 1) {{formation}} of an array of geometry, weight and variable data for the automated synthesis of articulated jib systems; 2) development of methodology of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the articulated jib systems, depending on the main technical parameters of the portal crane (maximum and minimum working radius, cargo lift height, tail radius value, carrying capacity of crane); 3) conducting {{of the study of}} the methodology adequacy on computer portal crane models. Methodology. To determine the kinematic characteristics of each link of the articulated <b>jib</b> system (<b>boom,</b> arm, <b>jib</b> tie, counterweight, load) we developed a dynamic and mathematical models that allow us to describe the movement of the articulated jib system when luffing. For the first time the technique of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the articulated jib systems depending on the technical parameters of the portal crane. Findings. The conducted mathematical modeling allowed scientifically proving the usefulness of the proposed methodology for determining the design parameters of the articulated jib systems. The designed package of geometry, weight and variable data helps to simplify the process of preparatory calculations before the automated synthesis and to optimize the design of the articulated jib systems of portal cranes. Originality. For the first time the work proposes the technique for calculation of the parametric data that allow us to determine the rational design parameters of the articulated jib system. There are developed local programs for the integrated optimization synthesis that make it possible to select the best design option simultaneously by several quality criteria and functional constraints. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the design parameters can be used in the design of new and modernization of existing portal cranes with the articulated jib systems, which, in turn, will reduce the material and energy consumption of the cranes...|$|R

60|$|Dec. 26th.--Fine {{view of the}} {{mountains}} of Bouru, which we have now approached considerably. Our crew seem rather a clumsy lot. They do not walk the deck with the easy swing of English sailors, but hesitate and stagger like landsmen. In the night the lower boom of our mainsail broke, {{and they were all}} the morning repairing it. It consisted of two bamboos lashed together, thick end to thin, and was about seventy feet long. The rigging and arrangement of these praus contrasts strangely with that of European vessels, in which the various ropes and spars, though much more numerous, are placed so as not to interfere with each other's action. Here the case is quite different; for though there are no shrouds or stays to complicate the matter, yet scarcely anything can be done without first clearing something else out of the way. The large sails cannot be shifted round to go on the other tack without first hauling down the <b>jibs,</b> and the <b>booms</b> of the fore and aft sails have to be lowered and completely detached to perform the same operation. Then there are always a lot of ropes foul of each other, and all the sails can never be set (though they are so few) without a good part of their surface having the wind kept out of them by others. Yet praus are much liked even by those who have had European vessels, because of their cheapness both in first cost and in keeping up; almost all repairs can be done by the crew, and very few European stores are required.|$|R
