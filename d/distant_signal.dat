25|$|The {{accident}} {{accelerated the}} introduction of Automatic Warning System– {{by the time the}} report had been published British Railways had agreed to a five-year plan to install the system that gave drivers an audible and visual warning that they were about to pass a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> at caution.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} is the <b>distant</b> <b>signal,</b> {{which has a}} yellow arm with a 'V' ("fishtail") notch {{cut out of the}} end and a black chevron {{typically}} 9-12inches (230–300mm) from the end. Its purpose is to advise the driver {{of the state of the}} following stop signal(s); it may be passed in the [...] "on" [...] position, but the driver must slow his train to be able to stop at the next stop signal. When [...] "off", a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> tells the driver that all the following stop signals of the signal box are also [...] "off", and when [...] "on" [...] tells the driver that one or more of these signals is likely to be at danger. By night, it shows a yellow light when [...] "on" [...] and a green light when [...] "off".|$|E
2500|$|One {{possibility}} {{to increase speed}} would be to increase {{the distance between the}} main and <b>distant</b> <b>signal.</b> But, this would require longer blocks, which would decrease line capacity for slower trains. Another solution would be to introduce multiple aspect signalling. A train traveling at [...] would see a [...] "slow to 160" [...] signal in the first block, and then a stop signal in the 2nd block.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distant</b> <b>signals</b> {{consist of}} one or two {{vertical}} lights. There is no red light.|$|R
50|$|Diversity {{combining}} reduces {{one possible}} single-point failure: any single receiver failure, or local interference {{to a single}} receiver, will not block reception on the entire system. Equipment sites can host many radio transmitters and receivers. A single site is subject to local, site-specific interfering signals. These interfering signals may {{come and go as}} transmitters switch on and off. A potential problem with receivers located at high-elevation receiver sites is that they may acquire <b>signals</b> from <b>distant</b> counties, prefectures, or other provinces. These unwanted, <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> can be stronger than desired signals from local walkie-talkies. The <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> may block local weak signals in some cases. Having several receive sites increases the probability that one of the sites will receive the local signal {{in the presence of a}} distant, undesired one. Selective calling can eliminate users having to listen to the audio of <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> even though the <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> are within receive range of one or more receivers.|$|R
50|$|On <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> and {{repeaters}} {{these other}} speeds are not displayed, therefore more restrictive aspect is effectively announced.|$|R
2500|$|The {{troop train}} {{collided}} head {{on with the}} stationary local train on the up line at 6.49 am. Just over a minute later the second northbound express train ran into the wreckage, having passed the Quintinshill Down <b>Distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{before it could be}} returned to danger. The wreckage also included the goods train in the down loop and the trucks of the empty coal train in the up loop. At 6.53 Tinsley sent the [...] "Obstruction Danger" [...] bell signal to both Gretna and Kirkpatrick, stopping all traffic and alerting others to the disaster.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany the {{standard}} distance from a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> to its home signal is [...] On a train with strong brakes, {{this is the}} braking distance from 160km/h. In the 1960s Germany evaluated various options to increase speeds, including increasing the distance between distant and home signals, and cab signalling. Increasing {{the distance between the}} home and distant signals would decrease capacity. Adding another aspect would make the signals harder to recognize. In either case, changes to the conventional signals wouldn't solve the problem of the difficulty of seeing and reacting to the signals at higher speeds. To overcome these problems, Germany chose to develop continuous cab signalling.|$|E
2500|$|The Intercity 125, {{otherwise}} known as the High-Speed Train (HST), was launched in 1976 with a service speed of [...] and provided the first high-speed rail services in Britain. The HST was diesel-powered, and the Great Western Main Line (GWML) {{was the first to}} be modified for the new service. Because the GWML had been built mostly straight, often with four tracks and with a distance of 1 mile (ca. 1.6km) between <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> and main signal, it allowed trains to run at [...] with relatively moderate infrastructure investments, compared to other countries in Europe. The Intercity 125 had proven the economic case for high-speed rail, and British Rail was keen to explore further advances.|$|E
5000|$|On October 7, 2009, NAB TV Board chair Paul Karpowicz {{planned to}} testify before the Senate Communications Subcommittee that {{broadcasters}} would be willing to allow subscribers of <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> to continue to do so even if the digital transition resulted in those subscribers receiving stations that they could not before. The NAB did oppose offering new <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> if a digital signal was available. The Satellite TV Modernization Act had to be passed by the end of 2009. The House bill also allowed Dish Network to offer <b>distant</b> <b>signals.</b> On November 5, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said he hoped for a [...] "short-time agreement" [...] on the bill passed out of committee September 24. If the Senate approves, the House will have to approve the bill, and if the two versions cannot be reconciled, the license to import signals that expires {{at the end of the}} year could be extended. The House version included an agreement with Echostar that, where possible, all 210 markets could receive signals, and Echostar could once again deliver <b>distant</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} clearly between the two, <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> use square plates while home signals use circular plates.|$|R

2500|$|The Ministry of Transport {{report on}} the {{collision}} was written by Lieut-Col GRS Wilson, {{a senior member of}} the Railway Inspectorate and published in June 1953. The local train should have been protected by two semaphore home signals; the Up Fast Inner Home about [...] to its rear, and the Up Fast Outer Home a further [...] back. A colour <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> (the Up Fast Distant) would show green if the Outer Home was ‘clear’, or yellow if the Outer Home was at ‘danger’ and was positioned [...] before the Up Fast Outer home; this being the full braking distance for an express at , the speed limit for this section of track.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the same}} period, British Rail also {{invested}} in a separate, parallel project to design a train based on conventional technology as a stopgap. The InterCity 125, otherwise known as the High-Speed Train (HST), was launched in 1976 with a service speed of [...] and provided the first high-speed rail services in Britain. The HST was diesel-powered, and the Great Western Main Line (GWML) {{was the first to}} be modified for the new service.

2500|$|The report {{noted that}} whilst the fog had lifted in the {{vicinity}} of Harrow station, with visibility improving to [...] witnesses estimated visibility at the Up Fast Distant to be [...] At , this would be covered in four seconds or less. [...] In these circumstances I can only suggest that [...].the driver.. must have relaxed his concentration on the signals for some unexplained reason, which may have been quite trivial, at any rate during the few seconds for which the <b>Distant</b> <b>signal</b> could have been seen from the engine at the speed he was running in a deceptive patch of denser fog. Having thus missed the Distant he may have continued forward past [...] station (which was not on his own side), underestimating the distance he had run from [...] and still expecting to see the colour light and not the Harrow semaphore stop signals which were at a considerably higher elevation.|$|E
50|$|The House {{approved}} the Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act December 3. It included both the House Commerce Committee and House Judiciary Committee versions and renewed {{the ability to}} use <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> for five years, allowed Dish Network to offer <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> again, and required 28 markets to receive signals not available locally. The bill also dealt with some copyright issues and required Dish Network to offer HD noncommercial signals by 2011 instead of 2013.|$|R
50|$|The ramps were {{provided}} at <b>distant</b> <b>signals.</b> A {{development of the}} design, intended for use at stop signals, was never implemented.|$|R

The next closest signal is yellow (proceed with caution), and the nearest signal shows green (proceed).|$|R
6000|$|Soon after this, on {{approaching}} the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{of one of}} the stations, they observed that the arms were extended, indicating that the line was [...] "blocked"--that is, that another train being in advance they must check speed or perhaps stop. This was a species of insult to the [...] "Flying Dutchman," [...] whose way ought to have been kept perfectly clear, for even a check of speed would inevitably cause the loss of several minutes. With an indignant grumble John Marrot cut off steam, but immediately the signals were lowered and he was allowed to go on. Again, in a few minutes, another signal checked him.|$|E
6000|$|The calculations, however, {{had been}} made correctly, and the train of trucks would have been well out of the way, if the driver had been a smarter man. Even as things stood, however, {{there should have been}} no danger, because the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> was turned to danger, which thus said to any {{approaching}} train, [...] "Stop! for your life." [...] But here occurred one of these mistakes, or pieces of carelessness, or thoughtlessness, to which weak and sinful human nature is, and we suppose always will be, liable. Perhaps the signalman thought the goods train had completed its operation, or fancied that the express was not so near as it proved to be, or he got confused--we cannot tell; there is no accounting for such things, but whatever the cause, he turned off the danger-signal half a minute too soon, and set the line free.|$|E
6000|$|As we have said, {{just before}} Gertie's arrival Sam Natly chanced to be {{attempting}} to dine. The telegraph needles pointed to [...] "Line clear" [...] {{on both sides}} of him. Dinner consisted of a sort of Irish stew cooked in a little square iron pan that fitted into the small stove. Being a placid, good-humoured man, not easily thrown off his balance either mentally or physically, Sam smiled slightly to himself as he put the first bit of meat into his mouth. He thought of his wife, wished that she was there to assist in the eating of it and shut his lips on the savoury morsel. A piece of potato was arrested by the sharp telegraph bell--one beat--of warning. The potato followed the meat as he was in the act of rising. Sam touched his telegraphic bell in reply to his signal-friend on the right, and [...] "Train on line" [...] was marked by a telegraphic needle pointing to these words. As the train was yet a great way off, at least as to distance, he sat down again and disposed of bit number two. Number three followed, and he had made some approach to engulfing number four when a shrill whistle struck his ear. Up he sprang, glanced at the time-piece, wiped his mouth, and went to the levers. He touched his bell--a single note of warning to his signal-friend on the left and received a reply, one beat, meaning [...] "Ready." [...] The train appeared, came up like a rocket and went past like a thunderbolt. When Sam saw its red tail-light, and thus knew that all the train was there,--that none of the tail carriages or trucks had broken loose and been left behind,--he gave a mighty pull to one of the levers, which turned up the arms of his <b>distant</b> <b>signal,</b> and thus blocked the line to all other trains. The needle was now [...] "pegged down" [...] or fixed at [...] "Train on line," [...] so that there could be no mistake about it, and no trusting to memory. Having accomplished this, he went to a large book which lay open on a desk in a corner, glanced at the time-piece, recorded the passage of the train--a passenger one, and once more sat down to dinner.|$|E
