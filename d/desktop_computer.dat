5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because {{that was all that}} would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way that}} aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E

As in previous studies, we use a list-based search engine results pages (SERPs) to conduct our examination. Our preliminary results contradict banner blindness on SERPs both on <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> and mobile phones. Additionally, the preliminary results suggest that top ads {{may be more effective}} in attracting users attention on mobile phones compared to <b>desktop</b> <b>computers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Setting up {{a secure}} <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> {{in her office}} was suggested, but Clinton was {{unfamiliar}} with their use and opted {{for the convenience of}} her BlackBerry, not the State Department, government protocol of a secured <b>desktop</b> <b>computer.</b> Efforts to find a secure solution were abandoned by Clinton, and she was warned by State Department security personnel about the vulnerability of an unsecured BlackBerry to hacking. She affirmed her knowledge of the danger, and was reportedly told that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security had obtained intelligence about her vulnerability while she was on a trip to Asia, but continued to use her BlackBerry outside her office.|$|E

25|$|Programmed from a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> with a {{wireless}} {{network interface controller}} in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.|$|E
25|$|Features such as {{biometric}} security or multiple interfaces (for example, Firewire) {{are available at}} a higher cost. There are pre-assembled external hard disk drives that, when taken out from their enclosures, cannot be used internally in a laptop or <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> due to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards, and lack of SATA (or Parallel ATA) interfaces.|$|E
25|$|All {{electronic}} devices emit electromagnetic radiation. Because every wire that carries current creates a magnetic field, {{electronic devices}} create some small magnetic fields when in use. These magnetic fields can unintentionally reveal {{information about the}} operation of a device if not properly designed. Because all electronic devices are affected by this phenomenon, the term ‘device’ can refer to anything from a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer,</b> to mobile phone, to a smart card.|$|E

40|$|Although {{more and}} more {{computing}} is performed away from <b>desktop</b> <b>computers,</b> most programs used in handheld computers, ubiquitous computers, and augmented-reality systems {{in the real world}} are still developed on <b>desktop</b> <b>computers,</b> and users of these systems cannot modify the behavior of the systems or make a new program for the systems without using <b>desktop</b> <b>computers.</b> Programs used in real-world environments should also be programmed in the real world, so we have developed a new programming paradigm, “Real-World Programming (RWP), ” which enables users to make programs for handling real-world environments as well as data in computers. By combining simple hardware and software, users can specify actions and conditions and create programs in the real world without using <b>desktop</b> <b>computers.</b> In this paper we describe the features required for RWP, programming techniques for RWP, useful devices for RWP, and examples of RWP...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, Jobs {{cancelled}} {{almost all}} of the product lines, and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> suitable for consumers. The result was the iMac released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as USB, which would then go on to become an industry standard. The iMac also shipped without a floppy disk drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as USB and Firewire for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 2200 was {{a single}} user system. The improved VP model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language (renamed Basic-2). The 2200 VP evolved into a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> and larger MVP system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies {{that appeared in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was controlled}} by six RCA 1802 COSMAC microprocessor CPUs: four on the spun side and two on the despun side. Each CPU was clocked at about 1.6MHz, and fabricated on sapphire (silicon on sapphire), which is a radiation-and static-hardened material ideal for spacecraft operation. This microprocessor was the first low-power CMOS processor chip, quite {{on a par with}} the 8-bit 6502 that was being built into the Apple II <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> at that time.|$|E

25|$|CPU-scavenging, cycle-scavenging, or shared {{computing}} {{creates a}} “grid” from the unused resources {{in a network}} of participants (whether worldwide or internal to an organization). Typically this technique uses a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> instruction cycles {{that would otherwise be}} wasted at night, during lunch, or even in the scattered seconds throughout the day when the computer is waiting for user input on relatively fast devices. In practice, participating computers also donate some supporting amount of disk storage space, RAM, and network bandwidth, in addition to raw CPU power.|$|E
25|$|Touchpads are {{primarily}} used in self-contained portable laptop computers {{and do not}} require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad {{is close to the}} keyboard, and only very short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user's palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes integrated in some <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> keyboards, particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.|$|E
25|$|Conventional PCI and PCI-X are {{sometimes}} called Parallel PCI {{in order to}} distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. Conventional PCI's heyday in the <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> market was approximately 1995–2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes; however, they are still common on modern desktops {{for the purposes of}} backwards compatibility and the low relative cost to produce. Many kinds of devices previously available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and PCI Express versions.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, IBM {{released}} APL.SV, {{which was}} {{a continuation of the}} same product, but which offered shared variables as a means to access facilities outside of the APL system, such as operating system files. In the mid-1970s, the IBM mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the IBM 5100 <b>desktop</b> <b>computer,</b> which had a small CRT and an APL keyboard, when most other small computers of the time only offered BASIC. In the 1980s, the VSAPL program product enjoyed widespread usage with CMS, TSO, VSPC, MUSIC/SP and CICS users.|$|E
25|$|A dock {{can allow}} some laptop {{computers}} {{to become a}} substitute for a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer,</b> without sacrificing the mobile computing functionality of the machine. Portable computers can dock and undock hot, cold or standby, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} system. In a cold dock or undock, one completely shuts the computer down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or undock, the computer remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or undocking, an intermediate style used in some designs, allows the computer to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a sleep mode prior to docking/undocking.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool was {{the first}} among UK {{universities}} to develop their <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions. The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings. The university has also {{been at the forefront}} of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment. This software, which makes use of unused computer time for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on. The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of Wake-on-LAN and commercial power management software.|$|E
