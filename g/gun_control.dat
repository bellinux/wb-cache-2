40|$|Reducing or {{preventing}} {{the misuse of}} firearms (whether criminal, suicidal or accidental) is central to <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> policy. In June 1997 the New Zealand Government received {{the recommendations of the}} Review of Firearms Control, an independent inquiry commissioned by the Minister of Police and chaired by Sir Thomas Thorp. The Review comprehensively examined several firearm-related issues, including {{the nature and extent of}} serious firearm offending in New Zealand. The research presented in this article was commissioned by the Review. Based on a population of 709 offences for the 12 months ending 30 June 1996, this study provides an analysis of serious firearm offending in New Zealand and discusses the implications of these findings for <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|The Second Amendment, by far {{the most}} {{controversial}} amendment to the US Constitution, will soon celebrate its 225 th anniversary. Yet, despite the amount of ink spilled over this controversy, the debate continues on into the 21 st century. Initially written with a view towards protecting the nascent nation from more powerful enemies and preventing the tyranny experienced during the final years of British rule, the Second Amendment has since become central to discussions about the balance between security and freedom. It features in election contests and informs cultural discussions about race and gender. This book seeks to broaden the discussion. It situates discussion about <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> within contemporary debates about citizenship, culture, philosophy and foreign policy {{as well as in the}} more familiar terrain of politics and history. It features experts on the Constitution as well as chapters discussing the symbolic importance of Annie Oakley, the role of firearms in race, and filmic representations of armed Hispanic girl gangs. It asks about the morality of <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> and of not imposing them. The collection presents a balanced view between those who favour more <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> and those who would prefer fewer of them. It is infused with the belief that through honest and open debate the often bitter cultural divide on the Second Amendment can be overcome and real progress made. It contains a diverse range of perspectives including, uniquely, a European perspective on this most American of issues...|$|R
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, national organizations {{on both the}} gun rights and <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>control</b> enactments {{adopted in}} the {{following}} three decades focused on banning of insidious weapons such as daggers or rifles hidden in walking sticks.

40|$|Abstract. Anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> fire <b>control</b> {{networking}} {{can improve}} the whole battle efficiency of anti-aircraft gun fire system. Aiming at the data processing need of fire <b>control</b> network, a <b>gun</b> fire <b>control</b> network track fusion system is designed. The system is realized by C programming language, which {{can be applied to}} the fire control computer. The flow diagram of the track fusion system is given. It mainly described the method of track correlation, track fusion, track management and threat estimation in the system. The system could realize the real-time processing of multi-batch target data in <b>gun</b> fire <b>control</b> network, and could provide basis for the subsequent target strike...|$|R

5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation of the <b>Gun</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E

50|$|The unit's {{final action}} was {{the capture of}} the German {{anti-aircraft}} battery at Termunterzijl. The battery's 128 mm <b>guns</b> <b>controlled</b> the whole area and the operation was hampered {{by the lack of}} artillery and air support. The action was hard-fought against stiff German defences built in great depth to protect the battery. Relentless pressure form the Westminsters forced the abandonment of the battery and the withdrawal of the remaining German forces.|$|R

5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

5000|$|Others {{doubt that}} <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> possess any {{preventative}} efficacy. In {{response to the}} Columbine shootings, a columnist of The Denver Post argued that these killers [...] "would have shot {{their way through a}} metal-detection device at the schoolhouse door." [...] Conservatives also cite the methods through which the two Columbine shooters obtained their guns as examples of the inefficacy of <b>gun</b> <b>controls.</b> For example, an 18-year-old friend of the killers purchased all of the long guns used during the shootings from three different unlicensed vendors at a gun show in December 1998. <b>Controls</b> over <b>gun</b> shows were seen as irrelevant to preventing the Columbine shootings because the friend who legally purchased the long guns could have also legally purchased the very same guns in a gun store. [...] Other progun conservatives cite a 2003 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, which concluded that [...] "there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combination of laws reviewed on violent outcomes." [...] Alternatively, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine claims that fewer restrictions on handguns will result in increasing numbers of injuries and deaths.|$|R

5|$|Gillibrand had {{numerous}} potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious {{at the time}} of her appointment. Most notably, Long Island Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance on <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> but McCarthy ultimately decided not to run. Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but ultimately decided against it in March 2009. Congressman Steve Israel was also a potential contender but was talked out of it by President Obama.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, {{threatened}} another filibuster, {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> measures.
