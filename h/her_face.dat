5|$|Stone's tears first {{roll down}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid, the surface tension {{is not sufficient}} for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E

5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|Fanny Longfellow died in {{the home}} in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire; her husband {{attempted}} to quell the flames, managing to keep <b>her</b> <b>face</b> from burning. Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing a beard to hide it.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} Machiko Kyō's second {{collaboration}} with Mizoguchi, {{as she had}} a small role in his 1944 film The Three Danjuros. She had collaborated much more frequently with Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the mother of Nyuserre is known with certainty: it was queen Khentkaus II, in whose mortuary temple a fragmentary relief showing <b>her</b> <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> son Nyuserre and his family has been uncovered. On this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale.|$|R
5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
5|$|Walder Frey {{celebrates the}} {{recapture}} of Riverrun with the Lannisters. Later, Walder eats dinner alone, wondering why his sons {{have yet to}} arrive. His servant reveals that she baked them into the meat pie he has been eating, and then removes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to reveal that she is actually Arya Stark who then slits Walder's throat.|$|E

60|$|Madame recoiled, and put {{her hands}} to her ears, horror stamped on <b>her</b> {{handsome}} <b>face.</b> <b>Her</b> massive bosom heaved.|$|R
5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hidden. She describes {{how she and}} other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Béatrice Altariba as Paulette Mérodon, a {{young woman}} who is taken into police custody after being caught shoplifting. Due to a {{resemblance}} with the women Génessier has kidnapped, she is informed by Parot that the charges against her will be dropped if she checks into Génessier's clinic. She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have <b>her</b> <b>face</b> transplanted, but is saved by Christiane before Génessier is able to perform surgery on her.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> appeared on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E

60|$|She saw him {{and began}} to speak, but he stopped and <b>faced</b> <b>her.</b> He <b>faced</b> <b>her,</b> {{grinding}} his teeth, and with such an awful fire of fury in his eyes that she shrank from him in terror, flattening herself against the wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{normally}} adult-natured {{adventures of}} Djustine involve <b>her</b> <b>facing</b> supernatural creatures (such as werewolves, zombies and demonic beings). All the stories {{take place in}} a strange, gothic western world of the 1880s.|$|R
5|$|In September 2001, Molly dumped Spike {{to become}} Mighty Molly, the superhero sidekick of The Hurricane. Molly, however, {{eventually}} left The Hurricane {{to become a}} full-time solo wrestler, taking his Hardcore Championship after whacking him with a frying pan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002 in Toronto. She promptly lost it to Christian an hour later after getting a door slammed in <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E
5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
