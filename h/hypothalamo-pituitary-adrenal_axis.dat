50|$|Metyrapone {{can be used}} in the {{diagnosis}} of adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone 30 mg/kg, maximum dose 3000 mg, is administered at midnight usually with a snack. The plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol are measured the next morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am. A plasma cortisol less than 220 nmol/l indicates adequate inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase. In patients with intact <b>Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis,</b> CRH and ACTH levels rise {{as a response to the}} falling cortisol levels. This results in an increase of the steroid precursors in the pathway. Therefore, if 11-deoxycortisol levels do not rise and remain less than 7 µg/dl (202 nmol/l) and ACTH rises, then it is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. If neither 11-deoxycortisol nor ACTH rise, it is highly suggestive of an impaired HPA axis at either the pituitary or hypothalamus.|$|E

We hypothesized that YGP would exert an anti-apoptosis effect on dexamethasone-treated anterior pituitary cells.

Hypophysectomisation blocks stress-induced ICER expression. Finally we demonstrate that injection of the pituitary hormone ACTH (Adrenocorticotropin Hormone) induces robust ICER expression in the adrenal cortex. Thus, induction of the transcriptional repressor ICER is coupled to the HPA axis response to stress...|$|R

40|$|There are sex {{differences}} in the activation of the <b>hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> in response to stress, but the source of these differences is unknown. The <b>hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> is regulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine-vasopressin neurones located in the paraventricular nucleus and these, in turn, are regulated by neural systems that include afferent noradrenergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY) -producing neural pathways. We tested the hypothesis that concentrations of noradrenaline and NPY will be elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampled from the third cerebral ventricle in response to stress, and these responses will differ in males and females. We collected concurrent samples of CSF (1 ml) from the third ventricle and blood (5 ml) from the jugular vein from gonadectomised rams (n = 7) and ewes (n = 5) at 10 -min intervals for 3 h. This procedure was conducted {{on a day when}} no stress was imposed and on a day when audiovisual stress was imposed for 5 min after 1 h of sampling. Following the audiovisual stress, plasma concentrations of cortisol and CSF concentrations of noradrenaline were elevated (p < 0. 05), but CSF concentrations of NPY did not change. Adrenaline was not detected in samples of CSF. The rise in plasma cortisol following the stress was greater (p < 0. 05) in ewes than in rams, but there were no {{sex differences}} in the rise in noradrenaline.

In recent years, studies in humans and other animals have provided evidence that the rebound GH rise which follows withdrawal of an infusion of somatostatin (SS) (SSIW) is due, at least in part, to the functional activation of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons of the recipient organism.

While GABA (lo- ’ to M) had no effect on basal CRF- 41 release (P> 0. 05), it significantly suppressed K ’ (28 mM) -stimulated release in a dose-dependent manner (PiO. 01). A similar inhibitory effect was observed with the GABA, agonist muscimol to M). Noradrenaline M) -induced CRF- 41 release was also significantly inhibited by GABA 10 - M. The inhibitory effect of GABA on K+-stimulated CRF- 41 secretion was completely. reversed by the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin M) in a dose-dependent fashion. Both bicuculline and picrotoxin stimulated basal and K + (28 mM) -stimulated CRF- 41 release, indicating the presence of tonic inhibition by endogenous GABA in the basal state.

Some rats were adrenalectomized and in a number, including intact animals, a corticosterone pellet (100 mg s. c.) was implanted; after 1 week, a single dose of clozapine (20 mg kg(- 1) i. p.) was administered. The clozapine-induced Fos response was not affected by adrenalectomy, apart from the nucleus accumbens shell, the subfornical organ and the supraoptic nucleus; then was an increased response in the nucleus accumbens shell, while other regions showed less Fos immunoreactivity. Implantation of the corticosterone pellet in both sham-operated and adrenalectomized animals, reduced the clozapine-induced Fos responses strongly in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the subfornical organ and possibly in the prefrontal cortex; in the supraoptic nucleus, this effect was seen only in intact animals. The effect of clozapine on plasma corticosterone levels was also diminished by supplemental corticosterone treatment. These results imply that the effects of clozapine are partially dependent upon <b>hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> integrity and activation.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the current evidence supporting {{the notion that}} endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) is a modulator of neuroendocrine function. CO is normally formed in the body during the enzymatic catabolism of heme moieties by heme oxygenase (HO). Three HO isoforms have been described to date: HO- 1, HO- 2 and HO- 3. In the brain, CO is principally generated by HO- 2 but, in discrete brain {{areas such as the}} paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, a role for HO- 1 is also possible. Moreover, under pathological conditions, the latter isoform is expressed by activated glial cells. The possible contribution by the recently described HO- 3 remains to be established. Once formed, CO exerts its biological effects mainly via the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, but alternative signaling mechanisms, such as the activation of cyclooxygenase or the inhibition of cytochrome P 450, have also been reported. In in vitro studies, the formation of CO within the hypothalamus has been associated with inhibition of the release of hormones such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin involved in <b>hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> activation and, conversely, with stimulation of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone release, thus suggesting that the gas may have a neuroendocrine role which may be to prevent over-exuberant activation of the <b>hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> and inhibition of reproductive processes within the hypothalamus during stress.
