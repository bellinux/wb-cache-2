The group later expanded into Europe, building networks in major European cities over the next 10 years. In 2001 Fidelity helped the Company to raise a further £400m to finance its future activities. In 2005 the company reached its first year of positive cash flow, and in 2007 its first year of profit.

In 2010 Colt rebranded from COLT Telecom to Colt Technology Services, deleting the acronym City of London Telecommunications to reflect its paneuropean nature.

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to make an optimum use of a country's limited {{productive}} resources is often a crucial one to the policy makers in less developed countries (LDCs). Not surprisingly, therefore, the various methods of cost-benefit analysis have attracted much attention among professional economists and are finding a wide spread application in evaluating the social profitability of investment projects and in the planning decision-making process as well. Relatively less {{attention has been paid to}} yet another criterion of project appraisal in a developing country that has been developed independently of social cost benefit analysis - the so called domestic resource cost (DRC) approach to project appraisals. This approach is properly regarded as the application of the propositions of allocation theory when the project, or the industry in question, produces (or saves) <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange.</b> The DRC concept compares the opportunity costs of domestic resources (primary factors such as labour, capital, land) conmitted to the production of final goods with prices at which these goods can be exported or imported - the latter prices (the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>gained</b> or saved) being considered as the ensuing benefits from production.

Generally, the literature study of earnings management indicates that the detection of earnings management can be grouped into two objectives, 1] to find variables for detecting earnings management (accruals, real activity and classification shifting) and 2] to use some advanced statistical or mathematical models to detect earnings management. This study applies a quantitative approach using secondary data of financial statements. The study was conducted on 50 companies with the largest market capitalization, 50 of the most active companies based on trading volume, 50 of the most active companies based on the value of trade and 50 of the most active companies by frequency trading. All of them are 200   public company (listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange-ID) based on IDX statistical report 2013. The results of this study are expected to provide a new method to detect earnings management and its application in the context of positive accounting theory (PAT). The results of the study proves that the model is able to detect earnings management by utilizing foreign exchange transaction losses and use these models to support PAT (particularly on debt covenant hypothesis). These results contribute that earnings management can be done by using the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>gain</b> / loss.

When Saudi Arabia itself and other United States-aligned oil producers significantly raised their production output—in an attempt to bring about economic implosion in the heavily oil-dependent Soviet Union—a global oil glut ensued. Oil prices collapsed to historic lows, and Venezuelan oil earnings, and economic and social stability in general, were suddenly imperiled: in the 1980s, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell by more than 20%, and by 1989 real wages fell {{to a third of}} their previous levels.

40|$|This paper studies {{long-term}} {{financial performance}} at the firm level. Fundamentally financial performance measurement is capital budgeting (or valuation) done ex post; expected cash flows and terminal values are replaced by realized or re-estimated flows and/or values. Beginning values may be derived from acquisition costs, opportunity costs or present (market) values {{at the start of}} the period. Similar choices must be faced with respect to terminal values. The interpretation of the performance measures differs accordingly. Note that there is no return concept corresponding to return on value in capital budgeting. For going concerns (accounting) book values represent acquisition costs. Hence choice of depreciation plan may affect the performance measure. Performance is measured relative to investors' required returns. Ex post some variations in required returns are known and must be incorporated in the analysis - in particular variations caused by changes in tax regimes as well as rates of inflation. In this paper it is assumed that investors have a fixed required real, risk-free rate of return after tax. Hence the nominal required return before tax depends on actual rates of inflation and taxes. Return on value for the case company - Odfjell ASA - is very close to estimated required return on equity over the 1986 - 97 period, about 16 % before tax. However, estimated return on invested capital is smaller - in the 10 % - 12 % range depending on depreciation method. The empirical analysis also demonstrates that value added on capital employed and operational capital exceeds value added on equity. In an ex ante analysis this will not happen as long as financial markets are competitive. Further analysis indicates that <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> and losses may explain this result. Whether movements in exchange rates have actually favoured holders of financial claims in the period or estimation errors are to blame, is unclear...|$|R
40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> carry trades involve buying high {{yielding}} currencies while selling low yielding currencies. Contrary to {{the implications}} of the uncovered interest parity condition, carry trades have generated consistent profits in the past decades. As <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> has <b>gained</b> increased relevance as an asset class in its own, the carry trade emerged as a major driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market turnover. Given the widespread use and ease of implementation of carry strategies, active currency managers should be evaluated relative to a benchmark which incorporates a proxy for carry trade returns. Within this thesis we study the profitability of various carry portfolio strategies on a very recent data set ranging from the 1 st of January 1999 to the 5 th of March 2010. Within three distinct empirical chapters we analyse whether different asset allocation, market-timing and money management methodologies have the potential to improve the performance of a simple carry portfolio, such as the one implemented by the Currency Harvest exchange traded fund by Deutsche Bank. Three main findings emerge from our investigation on carry trade portfolios. First, we find that a simple carry trade proxy is difficult to outperform with asset allocation and market-timing techniques. Nevertheless, we would not conclude that professional currency managers should cease to implement carry strategies, since they can add value to the investment process by successfully addressing the issue of optimal leveraging for carry trades. Second, we find that the portfolio flows of carry traders do uncover pockets of predictability in the FX market. Strategies which aim at front-running the trades of carry strategies, do generate positive returns with low correlations to traditional carry trade strategies and therefore offer good diversification vehicles for carry portfolios. Lastly, we find that while profitable market-timing seems feasible on historical backtests, the results are strongly dependent on the correctly timing the credit crisis. Thus, we note that our results are affected by a lookback bias. We posit that before the credit crisis, portfolio managers would not have had the foresight to select the correct market-timing indicators. We thus advocate a broad diversification of risk indicators for carry trade timing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
