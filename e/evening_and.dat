40|$|This paper refines {{previous}} {{work by the}} first author. We study the question of which links in the 3 -sphere can be obtained as closures of a given 1 -manifold in an unknotted solid torus in the 3 -sphere (or genus- 1 tangle) by adjoining another 1 -manifold in the complementary solid torus. We distinguish between <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd closures, <b>and</b> define <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd versions of the Kauffman bracket ideal. These <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals are used to obstruct <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd tangle closures. Using a basis of Habiro's for the even Kauffman bracket skein module of the solid torus, we define bases for the <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd skein module of the solid torus relative to two points. These <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd bases allow us to compute a finite list of generators for the <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals of a genus- 1 tangle. We do this explicitly for three examples. Furthermore, we use the <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals to conclude in some cases that the determinants of all even/odd closures of a genus- 1 tangle possess a certain divisibility.

40|$|Abstract. We adapt a {{basis of}} Habiro’s for the even Kauffman bracket skein module of S 1 ˆD 2 to define bases for the <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd skein modules of S 1 ˆD 2 {{relative}} to two points. We discuss genus- 1 tangle embedding, <b>and</b> define an <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd version of the previously defined Kauffman bracket ideal for genus- 1 tangles. These <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals are obstructions to tangle embeddings. Using our <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd bases for the relative skein modules, we show how to compute a finite list of generators for the <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals of a genus- 1 tangle. We do this explicitly for three genus- 1 tangles. We relate these ideals to determinants of closures of genus- 1 tangles. 1...|$|R
