Therefore, the glass {{transition is}} primarily a dynamic phenomenon.

On cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium.

40|$|Social {{networks}} {{have an important}} role in an individual's health, with the propagation of health-related features through a network, and correlations between network structures and symptomatology. Using Bluetooth-enabled smartphones to measure social connectivity is an alternative to traditional paper-based data collection; however studies employing this technology have been restricted to limited sets of homogenous handsets. We investigated the feasibility of using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, present on users' own smartphones, to measure social connectivity. A custom application was designed for Android and iOS handsets. The app was configured to simultaneously broadcast via BLE and perform periodic discovery scans for other nearby devices. The app was installed on two Android handsets and two iOS handsets, and each combination of devices was tested in the foreground, background and locked states. Connectivity was successfully measured in all test cases, except between two iOS devices when both were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> with their screens off. As smartphones are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> for the majority of a day, this severely limits the ability to measure social connectivity on users' own smartphones. It is not currently feasible to use Bluetooth Low Energy to map social networks, due to the inability of iOS devices to detect another iOS device when both are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state.</b> While the technology was successfully implemented on Android devices, this represents a smaller market share of partially or fully compatible devices.

40|$|A bisanthracene diester was {{synthesized}} in {{an effort}} to increase the rate of the anthracene photochemical dimerization. Preliminary reactions of the bisanthracene resulted in the formation of an intramolecular product that cyclizes across the 9, 10, 1 ’, 4 ’-position of the anthracenes. This results in an unsymmetrical dianthracene that possesses an isolated alkene group. The research in this thesis describes the photochromic properties of the bisanthracene, as well as studies into the reactivity of the isolated alkene. Different photochromic properties of the bisanthracene were investigated. The optimized conditions were found using a dilute solution in benzene while selectively exciting the bisanthracene. The addition of a peroxycarboxylic acid to the photoproduct resulted in the formation of an epoxide, which caused the intramolecular product to become more photochemically and thermally stable. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state.</b> Attempts to unlock this system by removal of the epoxide resulted in only low yields of the bisanthracene, but does represent a preliminary gated system for anthracene photochemical reaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to study and}} analyze the tasks of a robot and the {{interaction}} with its environment, by using the power of Petri nets modelling, especially the timed nets. Our system consists of a robot, a programmable automaton and a computer. We consider {{the execution of the}} tasks taking into account the temporal constraints. So, we use the temporal Petri nets to model the whole system and also for its verification. We describe the obtained Petri net and the constraints textually or graphically in the environment TINA, an open source tool dedicated for timed Petri nets. We note that the Petri nets have good qualities of abstraction from the modelling point of view compared to the finite state machines which suffer from the states explosion problem, related to the accessibility graph. Moreover, the consideration of the temporal constraints adds an important complexity to the problem; the system which was carried out successfully in the case "without temporal constraints", can get <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dead <b>lock</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> the case "with temporal constraints " if these constraints are not satisfied...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{theoretical}} {{models for the}} cooperative binding dynamics of ligands to substrates, such as dimeric motor proteins to microtubules or more extended macromolecules like tropomyosin to actin filaments. We {{study the effects of}} steric constraints, size of ligands, binding rates and interaction between neighboring proteins on the binding dynamics and binding stoichiometry. Starting from an empty lattice the binding dynamics goes, quite generally, through several stages. The first stage represents fast initial binding closely resembling the physics of random sequential adsorption processes. Typically this initial process leaves the system <b>in</b> <b>a</b> metastable <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> with many small gaps between blocks of bound molecules. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> second stage the gaps annihilate slowly as the ligands detach and reattach. This results <b>in</b> <b>an</b> algebraic decay of the gap concentration and interesting scaling behavior. Upon identifying the gaps with particles we show that the dynamics in this regime can be explained by mapping it onto various reaction-diffusion models. The final approach to equilibrium shows some interesting dynamic scaling properties. We also discuss the effect of cooperativity on the equilibrium stoichiometry, and their consequences for the interpretation of biochemical and image reconstruction results.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the color flavor locked phase {{in the presence of}} a strong magnetic field is investigated within the phenomenological MIT bag model, taking into account the variation of the strange quark mass, the baryon density, the magnetic field, as well as the bag and gap parameters. It is found that the minimum value of the energy per baryon <b>in</b> <b>a</b> color flavor <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> at vanishing pressure is lower than the corresponding one for unpaired magnetized strange quark matter and, as the magnetic field increases, the energy per baryon decreases. This implies that magnetized color flavor locked matter is more stable and could become the ground state inside neutron stars. The mass-radius relation for such stars is also studied.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient indirect fractional frequency synthesizer architecture {{based on the}} time delay digital tanlock loop. The indirect type frequency synthesis systems incorporate a low complexity high performance adaptation mechanism {{that enables them to}} remain <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> following the division process. The performance of the proposed fractional-N synthesizer under various input conditions is demonstrated. This includes sudden changes in the system input frequency as well as the injection of noise. The results of the extensive set of tests indicate that the fractional-N synthesizer, proposed in this work, performs well and is capable of achieving frequency divisions with fine resolution. The indirect frequency synthesizer also has a wide locking range and fast switching response. This is reflected by the system ability to regain its lock in response to relatively large variations in the input frequency within a few samples. The overall system performance shows high resilience to noise as reflected by the mean square error results...|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of coseismic Coulomb stress changes, the Coulomb stress {{presented}} a clear incensement in four areas resulting from the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. The aftershocks were mainly concentrated at the NW and SE ends of the seismogenic fault. They trend in a N-NW direction, corresponding to the extension of the northern section of the Huya Fault. This demonstrates that the aftershocks were the result of a continuous energy release from the Huya Fault. This further shows that the Jiuzhaigou earthquake was the result of NW extension and fracture of the northern section of the Huya Fault. It {{should also be noted that}} no aftershocks were recorded in the stress-reinforced regions at the NW and SE edges of the seismogenic fault. Considering that the epicenter and its vicinity have similar structural stress fields, the absence of aftershocks is an indication that these regions are still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> and the stress has not yet been released. The occurrence risk of a high-magnitude earthquake cannot be ignored in this region in the future. Conversely, the GPS deformation field from 2013 to 2015 indicated that although the slip rate of the northern section of the Huya Fault was faster than that of the southern section (Table  1), the slip model of the Jiuzhaigou earthquake presented a single point source model and did not result in surface rupture. This also indicates that it is likely that the stress has not yet been completely released and attention should be paid to the northern section of the Huya Fault regarding earthquake risk in the future.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} phase diagram of {{strongly}} interacting matter with massless u and d quarks {{as a function}} of the strange quark mass m_s and the chemical potential mu for baryon number. Neglecting electromagnetism, we describe the different baryonic and quark matter phases at zero temperature. For quark matter, we support our model-independent arguments with a quantitative analysis of a model which uses a four-fermion interaction abstracted from single-gluon exchange. For any finite m_s, at sufficiently large mu we find quark matter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> color-flavor <b>locked</b> <b>state</b> which leaves <b>a</b> global vector-like SU(2) _{color+L+R} symmetry unbroken. As a consequence, chiral symmetry is always broken in sufficiently dense quark matter. As the density is reduced, for sufficiently large m_s we observe a first order transition from the color-flavor <b>locked</b> phase to <b>a</b> color superconducting phase analogous to that in two flavor QCD. At this unlocking transition chiral symmetry is restored. For realistic values of m_s our analysis indicates that chiral symmetry breaking may be present for all densities down to those characteristic of baryonic matter. This supports the idea that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected in nature. We calculate the gaps at the quark Fermi surfaces in the high density color-flavor locked phase and map them onto gaps at the baryon Fermi surfaces at low densities...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of boiling and surface {{evaporation}} of quark nuggets in the cosmological quark-hadron transition with the explicit consideration of pairing between quarks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> color-flavor <b>locked</b> (CFL) <b>state.</b> Assuming that primordial quark nuggets are actually formed, we analyze the consequences of pairing on the rates of boiling and surface evaporation {{in order to determine}} whether they could have survived with substantial mass. We find a substantial quenching of the evaporation + boiling processes, which suggests the survival of primordial nuggets for the currently considered range of the pairing gap Δ. Boiling is shown to depend on the competition of an increased stability window and the suppression of the rate, and is not likely to dominate the destruction of the nuggets. If surface evaporation dominates, the fate of the nuggets depend on the features of the initial mass spectrum of the nuggets, their evaporation rate, and the value of the pairing gap, as shown and discussed in the text.

40|$|The {{control of}} the flagellar motor in Rhodobacter sphaeroides was investigated. Unlike most flagellar motors which are {{controlled}} by reversing the direction of rotation, the R. sphaeroides motor is controlled via a stop-start mechanism. Advanced optical microscopy was employed alongside genetic, biochemical, and behavioural techniques. High-resolution measurements of rotating beads on flagellar stubs revealed that the R. sphaeroides motor is similar to its E. coli counterpart, rotating counterclockwise at comparable torques/speeds (1, 300 pNnm/rad at stall torque), and exhibiting transient step changes in speed. The mean stop duration, mean stop frequency (number of stops per s), and run bias (fraction of time spent rotating) of wild-type at steady-state were 0. 66 ± 1. 01 s, 0. 31 ± 0. 19 s- 1, and 0. 80 ± 0. 20, respectively. Manipulating signal inputs to the motor genetically, or by exposing cells to chemotactic stimuli revealed that (i) without chemotactic stimulation the motor rotates continuously, (ii) phosphorylated CheYs are required to stop the motor, and (iii) the chemotaxis system cannot control the speed of rotation of the motor (termed chemokinesis) as previously reported. Complementation studies revealed that CheY 3, CheY 4, and CheY 5 are functionally equivalent. The copy numbers per cell of important CheYs were found to vary greatly under the conditions tested (< 1, 000, ~ 3, 000, ~ 60, 000 for CheY 3, CheY 4, and CheY 6 respectively). To determine how CheY-P binding causes the motor to stop, external force (viscous flow or optical tweezers) was applied to chemotactically stopped motors. CheY-P binding might either cause the torque-generating units to disengage from the rotor, analogous to a clutch, or trigger the rotor to jam, analogous to a brake. The rotor resisted re-orientation during a chemotactic stop implying that the motor was held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>state.</b> The value of torque resisting forward motion (keeping it locked) {{was estimated to be}} 2 - 3 x stall torque (2, 500 - 4, 000 pNnm/rad). Furthermore beads attached to flagellar stubs stop at fixed angles for several seconds, showing no large-scale Brownian motion. Step analysis revealed that these stop events occur at 27 - 28 discrete angles around the motor, which most likely reflect the periodicity of the rotor (i. e. copies of FliG). This represents the first experimental resolution of steps in the rotation of a wild-type bacterial flagellar motor with a full complement of torque-generating units.
