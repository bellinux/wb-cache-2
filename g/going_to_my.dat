Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, yet he has gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of grabbed me at that point and put me on the team." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the year}} {{drew to a}} close another single, [...] "Middle of the Night" [...] was {{released}} along with a greatest hits compilation, Twenty Greatest. Apart from featuring all their own hits and a smattering of album tracks and new songs, the group re-recorded both [...] "United We Stand" [...] and [...] "Where are You <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>My</b> Love" [...] for the album. Twenty Greatest became Brotherhood Of Man's most successful album, reaching Number six in the UK Charts and spending fifteen weeks in the top 75.|$|E

2500|$|The group came {{together}} in 1969 and began recording some songs with Hiller. Their first single [...] "Love One Another" [...] failed to chart, but the follow-up [...] "United We Stand" [...] (released in January 1970) was a worldwide hit. [...] "United We Stand" [...] was heavily played on British radio, and broke the American market. The single became a Top 20 hit in the UK, Canada, and US. The song has since been used as the closing theme for television's Brady Bunch Hour and as an anthem for various causes. Burrows left the group soon after and as a four-piece, The Brotherhood of Man followed [...] "United We Stand" [...] with another hit, [...] "Where Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Love". The song charted in the UK, Canada, and US and has since been covered by Olivia Newton-John and The Osmonds among others. A début album United We Stand followed soon after.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{mainline}} Christians {{claim that}} {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity implies that God should be called Father and not called Mother, {{in the same way that}} Jesus was a man and was not a woman. Jesus tells His followers to address God as Father. He tells his disciples to be merciful as their heavenly Father is merciful. He says the Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and that the Spirit of their Father will speak through them in times of persecution. On Easter Sunday, he directs Mary Magdalene to tell the other disciples, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Father and your Father...." [...] Mark Brumley points out that behind New Testament language of Divine Adoption and regeneration is the idea that God is our Father because He is the [...] "source" [...] or [...] "origin" [...] of our new life in Christ. He has saved us through Christ and sanctified us in the Spirit. Brumley claims this is clearly more than a metaphor; the analogy with earthly fatherhood is obvious. God is not merely like a father for Christ’s followers; he is really their Father. Among Christians who hold to this idea, there is a distinct sense that Jesus' treatment of women should imply equality in leadership and marital roles every bit as strongly as the definite male gender of Jesus should imply a name of Father for God. Rather than as antifeminist, they characterize alternative naming as unnecessary and unsupported by the words found in the Bible.|$|E
