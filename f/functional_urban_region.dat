The {{characteristics}} both {{of urban}} and rural cultural landscapes were studied on {{the example of the}} NE sector of Bratislava <b>Functional</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Region</b> (FUR), consisting of 18 municipalities with population of about 85, 000. The aim of the paper is to assess three main domains – demographic changes, quality of life and environmental quality – in order to specify differences between the rural and urban cultural landscapes and classification of the area according to the urban/rural characteristics. The resulting distribution of urban/rural areas even with some deviations confirmed the general trend of an increasing rural character of the area with the increasing distance from Bratislava...|$|E

40|$|Within the EU {{the last}} 20 {{years have seen}} {{increasing}} attention directed at the problems affecting urban areas and {{this has led to}} a range of policies/initiatives attempting to address these issues. During the 1990 s it became increasingly apparent these problems were not simply restricted to declining cities and that in and around many urban areas `excluded spaces’ were developing. At the same time, there has been a renewed emphasis on the use of Area-Based Initiatives (ABIs) throughout the EU (see Parkinson, 1998), although accompanied by a recognition that such policies need to be integrated into wider strategies for the city-region (or <b>Functional</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Region)</b> (European Commission, 1997 a and 1998) and nation as a whole.

The paper examines systematically the influence of location versus various firm characteristics. The econometric results suggest the following: First, a typical Stockholm firm has a significantly larger likelihood than other firms of being engaged in innovation activities. Second, among innovative firms, the R&D intensity and global collaboration on innovation is primarily determined by its corporate structure, not geographic location. Third, the embeddedness in regional and national scientific and vertical innovation systems is relatively more intense outside Stockholm.

40|$|Urban growth {{processes}} are notoriously complex, depending on vastly different demographic, socio-cultural and economic factors. The analysis {{is even more}} complex in the metropolitan areas, since they {{are the result of}} ancient agglomeration processes in a phase of intensive development of settlement and, more recently, of the formation of urban polycentrism. Investigation requires collection, analysis and processing of useful information at homogeneous territorial units, based on already consolidated models or through new validating protocols. The present paper analyzes urban growth based on a micro-scale approach, identifying homogeneous local districts for localization features that can affect real estate market value for residential use. These features include the location of the housing unit compared with the city center, the level of infrastructure, the presence of community facilities and shops, but also the external environment quality in terms of availability of green public and air pollution degree. Geographic Information System applications are used to process the available dataset to identify, at first, the demographic evolution of Naples as a <b>functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> according to the life cycle model proposed by Van den Berg and, then, the real estate dynamics of the metropolitan in the light of income flows which each asset is capable of producing.

The article reproduces, in citable form and, for scholarly purposes, {{the report of the}} same name produced by the author for the Greater London Authority. The report finds that estimates of even the most basic indicators, such as the level and growth of city productivity, diverge so much between the providers of estimates, that no single estimate of any indicator of city performance can be relied on. It explains why. The findings of this paper led GLA Economics to the conclusion that a world standard for comparing cities was required, leading to its work in defining a <b>Functional</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Region</b> (FUR) for London, and to joint work with the Greater European Metropolitan Areas Comparative Analysis (GEMACA) project, with Eurostat’s Urban Audit, and with the territorial working group of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to attempt to define a world standard The lack of such a world standard led GLA Economics to produce the benchmark dataset reproduced in this paper. This specifies output, employment and productivity for 27 cities, derived from standardised geographical definitions and harmonised data. The dataset serves as a reference for the GLA group and is used to compare and assess data commissioned from other private and official sources.

40|$|Nowadays it is {{well-established}} {{fact that}} urban regions and large ones {{in particular are}} crucial for promoting creativity, innovation and subsequent {{economic growth in the}} economy. There-fore, it is important to focus policies in Europe on how to improve the existing conditions of urban regions so they can function as engines of economic growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss policies needed to meet the current urban challenges and to make urban regions in Europe more competitive. A problem with current spatial policies at the EU-level as well as at the national level in most countries is that the policies mainly ignore functional urban re-gions and instead focus on administrative regions. A reason for this is that there is often no political body with authority over the whole <b>functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>region.</b> In this paper, we present ideas for a new type of spatial policies in Europe focusing on innovation and growth. For in-stance, there is a need to take measures to increase the density of population and companies in functional urban regions and to improve transport infrastructure to increase the geographical extension of functional regions. There is also a need to develop more urban regions into real innovation nodes by developing more elite universities with a proper R&D funding and a ca-pacity to compete with the best universities in the US. Another focus must be on increased investments in higher education as well as policies aiming at increasing the attractiveness of urban regions in terms of housing infrastructure and supply of amenities.

Within the EU funded research project PLUREL – Peri-urban land use relationships – ‘Strategies and sustainability assessment tools for urban rural linkages’, we developed a methodology for international comparison of regional strategies that considers the policy context at supra-regional level. This methodology helped to explain the reported impacts of strategies. For this we further elaborated the theoretical concept of policy arrangements and policy dimensions by Van Tatenhove et al. (2000) and Arts et al. (2006). Strategies and policy contexts referred to are from Montpellier Agglomeration, a formal coalition of now 31 municipalities, Leipzig-Halle region, a <b>functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> (FUR) with governance coalitions around green open space preservation strategies, and Hangzhou in China, a very large city with hierarchical formal government. Results showed how the means of influence from different government levels can complement and reinforce each other and raise the effectiveness of the strategies. A combination of hierarchical government with a horizontal coalition between local authorities covering the full FUR can be very effective for managing the land use developments in the urban fringe, even when private business, CSOs or other NGOs are not included in the coalition. Supra-regional authorities do not have to possess the land resources, but setting the Rules of the Game is a powerful means of influence to coerce local municipalities to preserve green open space in the urban fringe...|$|E

Demographic processes expressed by immigration-emigration and the natural component of the population development in the settlements of the Republic of Serbia from 1981 to 2002, aimed to identify spatial, demographic and functional changes and determine the degree of spatial differentiation of the Republic of Serbia through respecting the specificity of its territorial parts. Especially is emphasized the period from 1991 to 2002 when Republic of Serbia had a demographic decline in its entirety, with certain differences in the spatial manifestation {{but also in the}} intensity of relationship between natural and migration component of regional areas of the country. In Vojvodina, the migration balance had high values with whom he was able to compensate the consequences of negative natural growth. In the settlements of central Serbia the low values of migration balance even more emphasized negative natural increase, which together reflected on the overall demographic decline at the national level. <b>Functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> are recognized as the instruments of balanced regional development of Serbia.

40|$|The rapid {{developments}} in {{information and communication}} technologies (ICT) and the increased use of ICT motivate the vision of an evolving digital economy. During the last decade this evolving digital economy has been the pre-eminent driver of structural change and economic growth at both the national and the regional level in the developed, industrialised economies. The reason is, of course, that ICT functions as a new generic technology, which impacts society both broadly and deeply. ICT has, in essence, destabilised the near equilibrium conditions of an earlier time and contributed to conditions of greater disequilibrium. Thus, one major implication of ICT is that it has created prime conditions for entrepreneurial discovery and action. This implies that there are strong motives to study various aspects of the digital economy, since ICT continues to penetrate the developed economies also after the burst of the ICT stimulated stock market bubble. In this paper we analyse one aspect of the digital economy, namely its effect of the system of <b>functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> The motivation for this focus is that ICT offers new tools to organise information and enables major reductions in geographical transaction costs, the full implications of which is not yet well understood.

50|$|Functional {{regions are}} usually {{understood}} to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka et al., 2013; Smart, 1974). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but {{to a certain extent}} it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. The functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment.

Using PcGets as suggested by Hendry and Krolzig (2004) to optimise model selection we find that while PcGets provides a powerful tool for model selection when applied to cross sectional data, caution is necessary to ensure that variables relating to spatial adjustment processes are included and spatial dependence is avoided. More generally, not only do the results provide consistent estimates of parameters but they also support relevant theoretical insights. Finally careful testing for spatial dependence reveals that national borders are still significant barriers to adjustment within the EU.

40|$|Land use {{and land}} cover change (LULCC) {{dynamics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in the Mediterranean region, due to its historical development and to agro-pedoclimatic conditions favorable to human settlement. This area has undergone in the 1950 s and the 1980 s intense urbanization processes that has followed different trajectories. Urban expansion commonly occurs {{at the expense of}} agricultural land, leading to the fragmentation of natural areas and conflicts over access to land resources. These dynamics mainly concern the fringe between urban and agricultural land, e. g. the peri-urban areas usually included within <b>functional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> Here, to identify common features of LULCC in Western Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> we investigated two main features: direct changes due to urbanization and indirect changes affecting non-artificial land uses. We compared LULCC dynamics in 6 case studies from the north and south of the Western Mediterranean region: the <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> of Montpellier and Avignon (France), Pisa (Italy), Madrid (Spain), Meknes (Morocco), and Constantine (Algeria), using a 30 -year multitemporal spatial analysis (1980 - 2010). Two series of Landsat TM images were acquired for each case study and land cover data were analyzed both for dynamics and for land patterns, using landscape and class metrics. We found no significant north-south differences in LULCC dynamics between the investigated Western Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> Differences are more pronounced between small-medium cities and large metropolitan areas in type of urban diffusion, which is more sprawled in small-medium cities and more compact in large metropolitan areas. Rather, differences occur in LULCC not directly affected by urbanization, since in Northern Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> afforestation and abandonment of agricultural areas are prevalent and closer to the urban areas, whereas transformation of natural areas into agricultural ones occurs mainly in Southern Mediterranean <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> at a similar distance from urban areas than it happens for afforested or abandoned areas.

One force often mentioned in the literature is the maturing of products and industries that makes them less dependent upon the external economies offered by the large <b>urban</b> <b>regions.</b> Another force is the change in the type and the organisation of production taking place over time in the non-leading regions, which, for example, produce an increased demand for producer services. A third force worth mentioning is the secular rise in the real incomes in non-leading regions which give rise to an increased demand for various consumer services due to an income elas-ticity of demand greater than one. Given the above hypothesis a number of questions may be formulated: Is it possible to docu-ment these kinds of decentralisation processes? If so, what are their characteristics? How rapid are they? What differences are there between different products, different industries, different technologies, and so on? Are the follower regions catching up over time? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the spatial behaviour of a specific aggregate of private industries, namely urban growth industries, in Sweden during the period 1993 - 1998. Urban growth industries are defined in this paper as private industries in which the leading <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> in Sweden - the Stockholm region - specialise and that exhibit rapid growth in the rest of the country. The choice to analyse this group of industries are motivated by the hypothesis that it is this group of industries that has the largest potential for decentralisation of produc-tion and employment in the near future. ...|$|R
