5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> between Kehl and the Schutter, {{which lay}} downstream, the fortifications were equally secured. The redoubt there held about 8 cannons and 400 men, {{and covered the}} street between the hamlet of Auenheim and Kehl.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} good {{access to the}} {{motorway}} network. Junction 7 of the M60 is just {{to the north of}} Stretford's boundary with Sale, and the A56 road gives easy access to the south as well as to Manchester city centre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.|$|E

5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2008, on {{the last}} day of the {{transfer}} window, Reid joined Sunderland in a three and a half-year deal worth £5m, making the step back up to the Premier League. Sunderland's Greg Halford went <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> in a six-month loan spell as part of the deal. Reid explained that he wanted Sunderland to be challenging for European places, and will not be happy fighting relegation season-after-season.|$|E
5|$|Faversham {{railway station}} opened in 1858. A former goods sheet built {{as part of}} the {{original}} railway works is now Grade I listed.

However, a LET joint {{is susceptible to}} undesired motion when compressive/tensile load is applied because the torsional segments are placed into bending, as illustrated in Figure  5 (c).|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} first {{described}} in 1839 by Edward Robinson. It is 200 feet above <b>the</b> land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East and 60 feet high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions.</b> <b>The</b> mound was roughly square with 200 {{feet on a}} side in Robinson's time but has been reduced byexcavations and military action.|$|R
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war weary, had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to consider taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Many {{new plant}} {{medicines}} arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration {{and the resulting}} Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs arriving in the Americas included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and coca travelled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
40|$|Conditioning is {{the initial}} cycling where cell {{capacity}} is usually unstable. The {{causes of the}} initial capacity build were examined. Gridless electrodes were fabricated to ensure mechanical homogeneity, so that a strain measured in one direction would be typical of a strain measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions.</b> Plate hardness was also determined. These two parameters stabilize together...|$|R
25|$|The Confederate {{withdrawal}} from the Lynchburg stage road at this location allowed the Union cavalry to occupy {{a segment of the}} road and block the Confederate escape route toward Lynchburg. The Appomattox River was not fordable in this vicinity, which prevented a Confederate escape to the north, an option without much possible benefit in any event. Union troops blocked the Army of Northern Virginia's movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Northern {{provides}} passenger services. Three trains {{per hour}} run northeastwards to Manchester Piccadilly. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> trains run hourly on the Stoke line (serving all stations to Kidsgrove, then Stoke). On the Crewe line, one train per hour runs to Alderley Edge serving all stations, and one train per hour serves the same stations {{and continues to}} Crewe.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E
5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a bijection. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
30|$|Truck and car driving {{differ in}} several {{fundamental}} ways. While {{the truck driver}} has a better forward view, <b>the</b> view <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions</b> is more restricted. Also, truck driving entails a lower driving speed and a longer stopping distance due to the great vehicle mass, which, compared with car driving, may lead to more monotony. In addition, truck drivers are professional drivers and this may lead to difficulties generalising results from automated truck driving to car driving.|$|R
3000|$|Next, {{when the}} Stokes system {{is defined in}} a bounded Lipschitz Ω with a small Lipschitz constant, we show {{that the system is}} uniquely {{solvable}} in L_q(Ω [...]) spaces. In this case, we allow coefficients not only to be measurable locally in one direction (near the boundary the direction is almost perpendicular to the boundary of the domain), but also to have small mean oscillations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions.</b> To present this result, we require the following assumptions.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a linear {{analysis}} is presented for the coupled vertical, longitudinal and lateral oscillations of a cable {{with a small}} sag-to-span ratio. Generally, the lateral oscillations are treated as uncoupled from <b>the</b> motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study it is shown that existence of initial lateral displacement can induce coupling of all <b>the</b> oscillations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three directions. The effect of a periodic component <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lateral load on the dynamic stability of the cable is also investigated...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The July 1924 {{timetable}} showed eight {{passenger trains}} each way between Amlwch and Gaerwen, with the Red Wharf Bay railmotor operating to Llangefni {{three times a}} day. The extra Thursday service to Llangefni for the market was still included. By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now saw three pairs of passenger trains passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be shunted into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E

50|$|The school {{building}} {{is located at}} the south end of a 9.83 acre parcel at the west corner of Albany's West Hill neighborhood, a mile and a half (1.5 mi) north of the city's downtown. The terrain around the building is drastically different. On the south it remains relatively level; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>directions</b> it drops off roughly 100 ft into one of the ravines carrying small tributaries of the Hudson River that characterize Albany's topography <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern section of the city.|$|R
5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst {{and one from}} Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War {{as more and more}} freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
