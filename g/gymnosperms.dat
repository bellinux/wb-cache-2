40|$|China has {{the richest}} flora of <b>gymnosperm</b> in the world, which {{is crucial for}} {{understanding}} the change of global distribution and phylogeny of <b>gymnosperm.</b> We mapped the geographical range of 202 native <b>gymnosperm</b> species in China with records of altitudinal range and horizontal distribution at the county level, and explored the spatial distribution characteristics of Chinese <b>gymnosperm</b> at the family, genus and species levels. The uniqueness and similarity among the richness centers were analyzed {{with respect to their}} <b>gymnosperm</b> family and genus composition, and the endemism. Generally, Chinese <b>gymnosperm</b> shows a decreasing trend of richness from south to north. The richness is high in mountainous areas and low in large plains and on large plateaus. From the species, genus to family levels, the area with high <b>gymnosperm</b> richness increases, and the center with high richness shifts southward. About 85 % of all Chinese <b>gymnosperm</b> species are harbored in just 5 % of Chinese land area. We classified these regions into six richness centers: (1 Eastern Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains-Qinling Mountains; (2) joint area of Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi and the South Mountain Ranges; (3) central China mountains; (4) Huangshan-Wuyi Mountains; (5) southernmountains of Hainan Island; and (6) central part of Changbai Mountains. The floristic relationship of <b>gymnosperm</b> among the centers is obviously related with their geographic location, and the effect of isolation by distance. Among the six centers, Hengduan Mountains is a major variation center of <b>gymnosperm</b> in China...|$|R

40|$|Abundant <b>gymnosperm</b> pollen grains {{associated}} with the oedemerid beetle Darwinylus marcosi Peris, 2016 were found in Early Cretaceous amber from Spain. This discovery provides confirmatory evidence for a pollination mutualism during the mid Mesozoic for the family Oedemeridae (Coleoptera), which today is known to pollinate only angiosperms. As a result, this new record documents a lateral host-plant transfer from an earlier <b>gymnosperm</b> to a later angiosperm, indicating that pollination of {{the latter is a}} derived condition within Oedemeridae. This new fossil record exemplifies one of the four ecological-evolutionary pollinator cohorts now known to have existed during the global shift from a <b>gymnosperm</b> to an angiosperm dominated global flora. Currently, all direct evidence for pollination during the 35 million-year interval of the mid Cretaceous gymnosperm-to-angiosperm transition entails recognition of <b>gymnosperm</b> pollen grains on insect mouthparts and other body contact surfaces, while analogous records involving angiosperms are lacking. The gathering evidence indicates that angiosperm pollination was preceded by at least four <b>gymnosperm</b> pollination modes that served as a functional and ecological prelude to the rise and expansion of angiosperms...|$|R
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. <b>Gymnosperms,</b> such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All <b>gymnosperms</b> and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} tree-like organisms were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, {{which grew}} in {{forests in the}} Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been Wattieza, fossils {{of which have been}} found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree. Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the <b>gymnosperms</b> which evolved in the Triassic period. The <b>gymnosperms</b> include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared {{as a result of a}} whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago. Ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group of which the only survivor is the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic deposits.|$|E
5|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations of}} several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. Studies {{have demonstrated that}} Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and <b>gymnosperms.</b> Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings.|$|E

5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of <b>gymnosperms,</b> are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on <b>gymnosperms,</b> ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small <b>gymnosperms,</b> and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E

Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet heavy in <b>gymnosperms,</b> consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E

Albizia chinensis, the sweet sticky flowers of which are favoured by sloth bears, {{are also part of}} the region's flora. A decade long study by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala concluded that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, <b>gymnosperms</b> and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei, and Podophyllum hexandrum. In the summer season of 2016, a large portion of forests in Uttarakhand caught fires and rubbled to ashes during Uttarakhand forest fires incident which resulted in the damage of forest resources worth billions of rupees and death of 6 people with hundreds of wild animals died during fires.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and <b>gymnosperms,</b> the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E

25|$|All <b>gymnosperms</b> are woody plants.

Gymnosperm wood also often contains resin ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. oak, maple and walnut. In contrast, softwoods are <b>gymnosperms,</b> such as pine, spruce and fir.|$|E
25|$|In <b>gymnosperms,</b> the ovule is not {{contained}} in a carpel, but exposed {{on the surface of}} a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of <b>gymnosperms</b> in question. Two main modes of fertilization are found in <b>gymnosperms.</b> Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube.|$|E

25|$|The {{meristem}} architectures differ between angiosperms, <b>gymnosperms</b> and pteridophytes. The gymnosperm vegetative meristem lacks organization into distinct tunica and corpus layers.

40|$|The {{origin and}} rapid {{diversification}} of the angiosperms (Darwin's “Abominable Mystery”) has engaged generations of researchers. Here, {{we examine the}} floral genetic programs of phylogenetically pivotal angiosperms (water lily, avocado, California poppy, and Arabidopsis) and a nonflowering seed plant (a cycad) to obtain insight into the origin and subsequent evolution of the flower. Transcriptional cascades with broadly overlapping spatial domains, resembling the hypothesized ancestral <b>gymnosperm</b> program, are deployed across morphologically intergrading organs in water lily and avocado flowers. In contrast, spatially discrete transcriptional programs in distinct floral organs characterize the more recently derived angiosperm lineages represented by California poppy and Arabidopsis. Deep evolutionary conservation in the genetic programs of putatively homologous floral organs traces to those operating in <b>gymnosperm</b> reproductive cones. Female <b>gymnosperm</b> cones and angiosperm carpels share conserved genetic features, which {{may be associated with}} the ovule developmental program common to both organs.
