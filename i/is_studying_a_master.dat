40|$|The low-frequency {{shot noise}} {{properties}} of two electrostatically coupled semiconductor quantum dot states which {{are connected to}} emitter/collector contacts <b>are</b> <b>studied.</b> <b>A</b> <b>master</b> equation approach <b>is</b> {{used to analyze the}} bias voltage dependence of the Fano factor as a measure of temporal correlations in tunneling current caused by Pauli's exclusion principle and the Coulomb interaction. In particular, the influence of the Coulomb interaction on the shot noise behavior is discussed in detail and predictions for future experiments will be given. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for negative differential conductance and investigate the related super-Poissonian shot noise. Comment: submitted to PR...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons why}} Chinese Managers come to the UK to <b>study</b> <b>a</b> postgraduate management qualification. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 27 managers from the Guangxi province in China, who <b>were</b> <b>studying</b> <b>a</b> <b>Master</b> of Arts award in Management Studies at the University of Worcester. The research indicates that managers were motivated by increased knowledge of Western management practices, improved business English skills and personal reasons such as travel opportunities and culture experiences. Nonetheless, without financial support from employers, it is doubtful whether these individuals would have committed to study in the UK. The paper concludes by suggesting actions that universities could make in order to maximize the learning experience of Chinese students in the UK...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{pressure}} {{on the ability of}} training to teach useful and applied knowledge is growing, as society becomes more competitive and more information consumer. The aim of this research is to show whether the application of a project-based task in virtual groups has led to a greater significant knowledge to participants. Forty teachers who <b>were</b> <b>studying</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> program at <b>a</b> fully online institution participated in the study. Teachers worked in groups of 4 or 5 members through forums where they exchanged messages and files during four weeks. They had to carry out a project on how to integrate technology in schools and classes. Three types of knowledge were analyzed: academic, professional and applied. The results of our analysis show significant improvement in all three types of knowledge. Teachers were able to use more ideas, propose more actions and place them in a given context. Our results support project-based learning in virtual environments to foster meaningful learning...|$|R
