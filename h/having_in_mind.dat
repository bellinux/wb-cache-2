The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth's mother. After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman, <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> a future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, Elizabeth was sent to the dowager's court.|$|E

The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes.

We axiomatize three types of procedures: (i) The top two: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> an ordering and chooses the two maximal alternatives. (ii) The two extremes: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> an ordering and chooses the maximal and the minimal alternatives.

25|$|Commutative algebra (in {{the form}} of {{polynomial}} rings and their quotients, used {{in the definition of}} algebraic varieties) has always been a part of algebraic geometry. However, in the late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into Alexander Grothendieck's concept of a scheme. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra, which are locally ringed spaces, which form a category that is antiequivalent (dual) to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field k, and the category of finitely generated reduced k-algebras. The gluing is along the Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set-theoretic sense is then replaced by a Zariski topology in the sense of Grothendieck topology. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the étale topology, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc. Nowadays some other examples have become prominent, including the Nisnevich topology. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions, leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne-Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of a new}} {{terminal}} and upgrading the airport to regional standard started in 1984. In February 1987 Vardø Municipality received operating permission from the government. The investments cost NOK11.4 million, of which NOK10 million was to be financed through a loan and the rest through subsidies {{from the government and}} the county. The latter was also responsible for covering the operating deficit. The upgraded airport opened on 6 April 1987. The first two months Norving continued its taxi route service to the airport, but from 1 June a regular concession scheduled service was introduced. Widerøe took over the services in 1991. At first the airport was served using Twin Otters, but from the mid-1990s the Dash 8 was introduced. From 1996, Svartnes and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Widerøe lost the bid to operate the services between 2000 and 2003 to Arctic Air, but resumed services in 2003. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. There has several times been discuss whether to close down the airport, <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that Vadsø Airport is 67km away by road. In 2002 there was political support in Stortinget to close it if the road was upgraded, but neither happened. In 2015 Avinor stated that closing Vardø would give least passenger trouble related to the financial support in the country, but that no decision on it would be made before 2019. Because of lack of available aircraft for purchase, before 2030 all short airports must be extended, closed or be flown with very small planes. Vardø has no room for extension.|$|E

[...] She explained that during her process of writing music, she would get into a mood or a [...] "strange low that I ride" [...] that she would try to overcome by telling herself {{to let go of}} certain things, change and rejoice again; such experiences also inspired her to write [...] "Lithium".

A reporter, Benjamin Fine, <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> his own 15-year-old daughter, {{sat down next to}} Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, [...] "don't let them see you cry."

2500|$|On 22 January 1872, liberal Adalbert Falk {{replaced}} conservative Heinrich von Mühler as Prussian {{minister for}} religion, education and health. In Bismarck's mind, Falk was [...] "to re-establish {{the rights of}} the state in relation to the church". Yet, unlike Bismarck, whose main motivation for the Kulturkampf was the political power struggle with the Centre Party, Falk, a lawyer, was a strong proponent of state authority <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the legal aspects of state-church relationships. Falk became {{the driving force behind the}} Kulturkampf laws. Although Bismarck publicly supported Falk, he doubted the success of his laws and was unhappy with his lack of political tact and sensitivity.

2500|$|Once a {{high school}} program was established, {{it became obvious that}} {{athletics}} would not only be important, but also would be a venue in which the school would be viewed by many others outside the school. A Christian philosophy of athletics was written to guide the athletic development of students and to reflect Christian values on the playing field and in the stands. CHA's philosophy of athletics is as follows: Since we are ambassadors for Jesus Christ, let us conduct ourselves in word and action just as Christ would conduct himself. Therefore, all that we do, we will do with a total release of our mental and physical abilities and our emotional energies towards our performance, <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that Christ is our only audience.

2500|$|The vows and pledges being annulled by this {{ceremony}} {{are of a}} limited category. As the ArtScroll Mahzor explains it: [...] "There is a dangerous and erroneous misconception among some people that the Kol Nidrei nullification of vows—whether past or future—... gives people the right to break their word or to make insincere promises that will have no legal force. This is not the case. The Kol Nidrei declaration can invalidate only vows that one undertakes on his own volition. It {{has no effect on}} vows or oath imposed by someone else, or a court. Also, the invalidation of future vows takes effect only if someone makes the vow without <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> his previous Kol Nidrei declaration. But if he makes the vow with Kol Nidrei in mind—thus being openly insincere in his vow—the vow is in full force." [...] Moreover, as Rabbi Yechiel of Paris explained in a Disputation that took place before the King and Queen of France in 1240, [...] "Only the erroneously broken vows are annulled, that nobody might commit the sin of intentionally breaking vows." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late November 1830, Radonjić {{wrote to}} {{vice-consul}} Gagić in Dubrovnik complaining about Cetinje's inability {{to hold the}} tribes together and the anarchy that was sweeping through the countryside. This apparently led him to conspire with the Austrians to have Njegoš removed from his throne and have him replaced by his cousin, Đorđije. On orders from Franjo Tomašić, {{the governor of the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia, the commander of Fort Dubrovnik met Radonjić at Kotor on [...] Radonjić left Montenegro without informing Njegoš or the other chieftains, raising much suspicion. His meeting with the Austrian commander did not remain a secret for very long. On 28 November, a group of Montenegrins who happened to be visiting Kotor noticed Radonjić {{in the company of a}} few Austrian officers. They stormed the house where the meeting was taking place, exchanged obscenities with Radonjić and hurried back to Cetinje to report on what they had seen; Njegoš was furious. In a letter to Gagić dated , he wrote: [...] "Radonjić [...] to the Kotor hinterland... without anybody's notice, but on his own... and there met some imperial general and other imperial men, <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to give up Montenegro and place it under their protection thinking that after the late vladikas death there were no sons of Montenegro allied to glorious Russia." ...|$|E
2500|$|An American {{magazine}} Literature World, believing all {{the novels}} by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell were {{produced by the}} same person, praised their author as a genius, who can make [...] "his incongruities appear natural". Noting, that [...] "all that is good or attractive about [...] is or might be womanish" [...] it supposes that the author may be [...] "some gifted and retired woman". Despite considering The Tenant [...] "infinitely inferior" [...] to Jane Eyre, Literature World admits that two novels share [...] "the same mysterious word-painting" [...] with which the author [...] "conveys the scene he (or she) describes to the mind's eye, so as not only to impress it with the mere view, but to speak, as it were, to the imagination, to the inner sense, as it ever {{the case with the}} Poetry as the Painting of real genius". Again <b>having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> both Jane Eyre and The Tenant, it concludes: [...] "However objectionable this works may be to crude minds which cannot winnow the chaff vulgarity from rich grain of genius which burdens them, very many, while enjoying the freshness and vigour, will gladly hail their appearance, as boldly and eloquently developing blind places of wayward passion in the human heart, which is far more interesting to trace than all bustling traces and murky alleys, through which the will-o’-the-wisp genius of Dickens has so long led the public mind".|$|E

40|$|Writing {{programs}} in System F is certainly possible, {{and the type}} system gives us nice benefits such as stuck-freedom. But the price we pay is in the notation: annotating programs with the types the programmer <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for them is tedious, difficult, brittle, and notationally heavy. Wouldn’t it be nice if the system could permit us to write programs using an untyped notation, and have it somehow discover the types we <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind?</b> Looking {{at it from a}} Curry-Howard perspective, the program we’d write would be a proof; we’d want the system to discover the proposition the programmer <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Informally, type inference (also known as type reconstruction; I will be using the two terms interchangeably) is just this process of analyzing a program written using untyped notation and discovering a sensible type for it. The challenges are in producing a type specific enough to continue to guarantee stuck-freedom but general enough to be usable in all the contexts the programmer <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>In</b> these notes, I’ll present two approaches to type inference for the language ML: a modular constraint-based approach, where terms are analyzed to produce constraint sets, which are subsequently solved to produce substitutions which give rise to principal types for the program; and...|$|R
2500|$|Dvořák {{entered the}} Austrian Prize {{competition}} again in 1877, submitting his Moravian Duets and other music, possibly his Piano Concerto. He {{did not learn}} the outcome until December. Then, he received a personal letter from the music critic Eduard Hanslick, who had also been on the juries awarding the prizes. The letter not only notified Dvořák that he had again won the prize, but made known to {{him for the first}} time that Brahms and Hanslick had been on the jury. The letter conveyed an offer of friendly assistance of the two in making Dvořák's music known outside his Czech motherland. Within the month December 1877, Dvořák wrote his String Quartet no. 9 in D minor and dedicated it to Brahms. Both Brahms and Hanslick had been much impressed by the Moravian Duets, and Brahms recommended them to his publisher, Simrock, who published them with success. <b>Having</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> Brahms's well-received Hungarian Dances, Simrock commissioned Dvořák to write something of the same nature. Dvořák submitted his Slavonic Dances, Op. 46 in 1878, first for two pianos, but when requested by Simrock, also in an orchestral version. These were an immediate and great success. On 15 December 1878, the leading music critic Louis Ehlert in the Berlin [...] "Nationalzeitung" [...] published a review of the Moravian Duets and Slavonic Dances, saying that the [...] "Dances" [...] would make their way [...] "round the world" [...] and [...] "a heavenly naturalness flows through this music." [...] "There was a run on the German music shops for the dances and duets of this hitherto... unknown composer." [...] The dances were played in 1879 in concerts in France, England, and the United States. Later Simrock requested further Slavonic Dances, which Dvořák supplied in his Op. 72, 1886.|$|E
