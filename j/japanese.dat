5|$|During the <b>Japanese</b> colonial era, <b>Japanese</b> {{settlers}} mainly used <b>Japanese</b> {{in their}} daily discourse, and <b>Japanese</b> was the lingua franca used for communication between <b>Japanese</b> and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with <b>Japanese,</b> and many <b>Japanese</b> had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in <b>Japanese</b> than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The <b>Japanese</b> also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the <b>Japanese</b> surrender, the use of <b>Japanese</b> was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan {{in their daily}} discourse in favour of <b>Japanese</b> or English, although <b>Japanese</b> was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have <b>Japanese</b> ancestry. As the number of <b>Japanese</b> tourists increased during the 1990s, <b>Japanese</b> was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Japanese</b> colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between <b>Japanese</b> men and Palauan women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to <b>Japanese</b> norms and values and spoke <b>Japanese</b> in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language, although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both <b>Japanese</b> and Palauan fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as <b>Japanese</b> in official figures and had access to <b>Japanese</b> social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in <b>Japanese</b> and Palauan circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of <b>Japanese</b> men were shunned upon, and Palauan nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between <b>Japanese</b> men and Palauan women. The <b>Japanese</b> government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided social benefits to women who had married <b>Japanese</b> men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and <b>Japanese</b> women, and there was only one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a <b>Japanese</b> woman during the <b>Japanese</b> colonial-era.|$|E
5|$|During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted {{against the}} <b>Japanese</b> while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Wushe Incident, since the <b>Japanese</b> had long played them off {{against each other}} and the <b>Japanese</b> used Toda and Truku (Taroko) {{collaborators}} to massacre the Tkdaya. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the <b>Japanese</b> after the incident. The Truku had resisted and fought the <b>Japanese</b> before in the 1914 Truku war 太魯閣戰爭 but had since been pacified and collaborated with the <b>Japanese</b> in the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of {{civilian}} administration, the <b>Japanese</b> population consisted of about a few hundred individuals, and reached a little over 2,000 by 1930. The <b>Japanese</b> resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid-1930s onwards, and there were about 15,000 <b>Japanese</b> in Palau by 1938, the vast majority of whom were concentrated in Koror. The influx of <b>Japanese</b> immigrants fuelled the development of Koror into a city by 1939. The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the <b>Japanese,</b> and constituted only about 16 percent of the city's population in 1937. The <b>Japanese</b> made up {{more than half of the}} islands' population, as well as 27% of Micronesia's <b>Japanese</b> population in a 1938 census. A large minority of the <b>Japanese</b> populace consisted of Okinawan immigrants, as well as a few Koreans. Palau's <b>Japanese</b> population was repatriated after the <b>Japanese</b> surrender, but people of Japanese-Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau's population. A study done by the Sasakawa Pacific Island Nations Fund estimated that about 10% of Palauans are born to a <b>Japanese</b> father and Palauan mother, the vast majority of whom were born before 1945. Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25% of Palau's populace have some <b>Japanese</b> ancestry.|$|E

5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of <b>Japanese</b> architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. <b>Japanese</b> sculpture, largely of wood, and <b>Japanese</b> painting are among {{the oldest of the}} <b>Japanese</b> arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of <b>Japanese</b> painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native <b>Japanese</b> aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a small}} <b>Japanese</b> {{community}} in Palau, which mainly consists of <b>Japanese</b> expatriates residing in Palau over a long-term basis. A few <b>Japanese</b> expatriates started to reside in Palau after it gained independence in 1994, and established long-term businesses in the country. <b>Japanese</b> settlement in Palau {{dates back to the}} early 19th century, although large scale <b>Japanese</b> migration to Palau did not occur until the 1920s, when Palau came under <b>Japanese</b> rule and administered as part of the South Pacific Mandate. <b>Japanese</b> settlers took on leading administrative roles in the <b>Japanese</b> colonial government, and developed Palau's economy. After the <b>Japanese</b> surrender in 1945, virtually all of the <b>Japanese</b> population was repatriated back to Japan, although people of mixed Japanese-Palauan descent were allowed to remain behind. People of Japanese-Palauan descent constitute a large minority of Palau's population as a result of substantial intermarrriage between the <b>Japanese</b> settlers and Palauans. They generally identify with, conforming to cultural norms and daily lives with the Palauans.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{fighting}} in Papua, most of the Australian personnel captured by <b>Japanese</b> troops were murdered. In response, {{for the remainder of}} the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture <b>Japanese</b> personnel and aggressively sought to kill their <b>Japanese</b> opponents including some that had surrendered. Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the <b>Japanese</b> withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea. Meanwhile, during {{the fighting}} in 1942–43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the <b>Japanese</b> in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|Unaffected by any stagnating German-Japanese trade relations, the <b>Japanese</b> {{community}} in Düsseldorf, home to Europe's largest Japantown, is growing again after {{a decline in}} the 1980s and 1990s. In 2008, over 8000 <b>Japanese</b> lived in the Düsseldorf area, which features a <b>Japanese</b> school, two kindergartens, three libraries and numerous <b>Japanese</b> clubs. Moreover, over 200 <b>Japanese</b> companies are active in that region, creating over 20,000 jobs. The <b>Japanese</b> community is widely considered a great asset for Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>Japanese</b> {{surrendered}} in 1945, <b>Japanese</b> business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the <b>Japanese</b> influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. <b>Japanese</b> tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the <b>Japanese</b> era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} <b>Japanese</b> tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in <b>Japanese</b> and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of <b>Japanese</b> tourists.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to {{maintain}} pressure on the <b>Japanese</b> garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing {{in an effort to}} draw <b>Japanese</b> reinforcements away from Lae. In this they were completely successful; the <b>Japanese</b> 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of <b>Japanese</b> troops, including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area throughout the campaign. Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 <b>Japanese</b> soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in combat units.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{sub-type of}} coastal batik called Jawa Hokokai is not {{attributed}} to a particular region. During the <b>Japanese</b> occupation of Indonesia in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages. The workshops funded by the <b>Japanese</b> however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called Jawa Hokokai. Common motifs of Hokokai includes <b>Japanese</b> cherry blossoms, butterflies, and chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} <b>Japanese</b> forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh <b>Japanese</b> troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} <b>Japanese</b> troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the <b>Japanese</b> were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six German surface raiders, four <b>Japanese</b> {{aircraft}} carriers, seven <b>Japanese</b> cruisers, nine <b>Japanese</b> destroyers and twenty eight <b>Japanese</b> and German submarines operated in Australian waters between 1940 and 1945. These 54 warships sank 53 merchant ships and three warships within the Australia Station, resulting {{in the deaths of}} over 1,751 Allied military personnel, sailors and civilians. Over 88 people were also killed by IJN air attacks on towns in northern Australia. In exchange, the Allies sank one German surface raider, one full-sized <b>Japanese</b> submarine and two midget submarines within Australian waters, resulting in the deaths of 157 Axis sailors. A further two German submarines were sunk while en route to Australian waters with the loss of 81 sailors.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} {{captured}} documents, on 7 January 1941 <b>Japanese</b> Admiral Yamamoto {{wrote to the}} Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the <b>Japanese</b> to deliver a deathblow. Thereby, Nanshin-ron, {{the concept of the}} <b>Japanese</b> Navy conducting a southern campaign quickly matured and gained further proponents.|$|E
5|$|After the Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Navy's {{attacks on}} the Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from <b>Japanese</b> attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean. From 1940 onwards, there was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters first from German commerce raiders and submarines and later by the Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Navy.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Japanese</b> {{surrender}} in 1945, <b>Japanese</b> settlers were repatriated back to Japan, {{and male}} <b>Japanese</b> settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their <b>Japanese</b> spouses along.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the <b>Japanese</b> in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the <b>Japanese</b> {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the <b>Japanese</b> logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the <b>Japanese</b> soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the <b>Japanese</b> {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the <b>Japanese</b> convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the <b>Japanese</b> to scramble for cover. The <b>Japanese</b> tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 <b>Japanese</b> soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the <b>Japanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{landed on}} Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under {{construction}} by the <b>Japanese</b> military. There were several subsequent {{attempts by the}} Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Army and Navy, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield, which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the <b>Japanese</b> organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several <b>Japanese</b> warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field {{with the goal of}} destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the <b>Japanese</b> reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the <b>Japanese</b> ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the <b>Japanese</b> and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between <b>Japanese</b> forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the <b>Japanese</b> weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the <b>Japanese</b> commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the <b>Japanese</b> and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Although ill-equipped {{and having}} {{received}} little training, Dalforce {{was sent to}} the northwestern front where they fought against <b>Japanese</b> landing parties during the battles of Sarimbun Beach and Kranji. Despite their efforts, Singapore fell to the <b>Japanese</b> {{a few days after the}} invasion, and the <b>Japanese</b> army moved in to occupy the Chin Kang Huay Kuan. After the <b>Japanese</b> surrender on September 1945, Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Japanese</b> Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in this battle, the <b>Japanese</b> were {{not yet ready to}} give up the struggle for Guadalcanal. The <b>Japanese</b> Army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further offensive against Henderson Field in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there had}} been plenty of {{fighting}}, the main <b>Japanese</b> force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7thCavalry found it on 20March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8thCavalry reduced the entrenched <b>Japanese</b> positions there. The <b>Japanese</b> bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.|$|E

5|$|An {{exchange}} of <b>Japanese</b> and Allied diplomatic personnel {{stranded in the}} opposing nations occurred in August 1942, which allowed Tatsuo Kawai, the <b>Japanese</b> ambassador to Australia, to return home with {{the ashes of the}} four <b>Japanese</b> submariners. When the exchange ship Kamakura Maru arrived in Yokohama, several thousand people were present to honour the four men.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{irregular}} payments for acquisitions {{had resulted in}} very significant asset impairment charges in the company's accounts, and this was exposed {{in an article in}} the <b>Japanese</b> financial magazine FACTA and had come to Woodford's attention. <b>Japanese</b> press speculated on a connection to Yakuza (<b>Japanese</b> organised crime syndicates). Olympus defended itself against allegations of impropriety.|$|E
5|$|Around the mid-1980s, German and <b>Japanese</b> representatives {{decided to}} rebuild the old <b>Japanese</b> embassy in Berlin from 1938. Its remains had {{remained}} unused after the building was largely destroyed during World War II.
