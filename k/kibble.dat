5|$|In April 2007, the NIST's {{implementation}} of the <b>Kibble</b> balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36µg and a short-term resolution of µg. The UK's National Physical Laboratory's <b>Kibble</b> balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3µg in 2007. That <b>Kibble</b> balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} with <b>Kibble</b> balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of <b>Kibble</b> balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's <b>Kibble</b> balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the <b>Kibble</b> balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} <b>Kibble</b> balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of <b>Kibble</b> balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kibble</b> balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the <b>Kibble</b> balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E

5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the <b>Kibble</b> balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the <b>Kibble</b> balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a <b>Kibble</b> balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E
5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom <b>Kibble,</b> Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{first drive}} began inauspiciously for the Hokies. Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} {{pass on the}} first Tech play, then was sacked for a four-yard loss. Facing third down, Druckenmiller evaded another sack and connected with Oxendine on a 41-yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska side of the field. Despite the gain, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes. Virginia Tech punter Jimmy <b>Kibble</b> kicked the ball back to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E
50|$|After harvest, carob pods have a {{moisture}} content of 10-20% {{and should be}} dried down to a {{moisture content}} of 8% so the pods do not rot. Further processing separates the kernels (seeds) from the pulp. This process is called <b>kibbling</b> and results in seeds and pieces of carob pods (<b>kibbles).</b> Processing of the pulp includes grinding for animal feed production or roasting and milling for human food industry. The seeds have to be peeled which happens with acid or through roasting. Then the endosperm and the embryo are separated for the different uses.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{begins on}} a rainy night. We see the infamous Amityville Horror house. Six priests, led by Father Manfred (Norman Lloyd) enter the house and start to exorcise it. One of the priests, Father Dennis <b>Kibbler</b> (Fredric Lehne) is in an upstairs bedroom and begins to bless it when he sees a glowing brass floor lamp. As he begins to chant, {{a burst of energy}} emerges from the outlet, through the cord, and into the lamp. A demonic face appears in the large round bulb. <b>Kibbler</b> is knocked across the room and is unconscious.|$|R
50|$|Polyphosphates {{can be used}} to {{coat the}} <b>kibbles</b> of both dog and cat dental diets. These {{compounds}} are effective at binding to minerals, in particular calcium, which would otherwise bind to plaque and harden to form tartar. In particular, sodium hexametaphosphate has been shown to effectively decrease tartar buildup on teeth. It is able to do this by binding to the calcium component found in tartar. <b>Kibbles</b> coated with this compound have been proven to prevent the formation of tartar on all teeth, and not just those involved in the mechanical breakdown of food (mainly the molars).|$|R
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the <b>Kibble</b> balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy <b>Kibble.</b> Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran into the end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was no good. Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began its}} third {{possession}} of the game at the Tech 24-yard line after a short kick return. Running back Andre Kendrick ran for a short gain, but on the next play Vick was called for an intentional grounding penalty while attempting to avoid a sack. The Hokies were unable {{to make up the}} yardage lost by the penalty and punted after failing to gain a first down. Owing to the penalty, Tech punter Jimmy <b>Kibble</b> was forced to kick from his own end zone. Florida State was able to break through the Tech offensive line during the punt and blocked the kick. The ball was picked up by Florida State defender Jeff Chaney, who dashed into the end zone for Florida State's second touchdown of the game. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 140 lead with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|Scales {{like the}} <b>Kibble</b> balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} squad was more highly {{regarded}} than its defense. Overall, Virginia Tech was 14th nationally in net punting and 37th in kickoff returns. Punter Jimmy <b>Kibble</b> was the No. 10 {{player in the}} country at his position, averaging 45.1 yards per kick during the regular season. Because of Virginia Tech's success at blocking kicks—the Hokies blocked seven during the season—North Carolina made a special effort to prepare for Virginia Tech's kick blockers on special teams. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham set Big East single-season records for field goals made (19) and points scored by kicking (92) during the season. He was 35 of 36 on extra points and 19 for 23 on field goals, but caught the flu prior to the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The post-score kickoff {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech began at its 20-yard line. On the first play, Nebraska {{committed}} a five-yard offsides penalty. Shyrone Stith and Parker then ran for a combined six yards on the next two plays, picking up a first down with the shortened yardage provided by the penalty. From the first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw three consecutive passes: The first was incomplete, the second gained one yard, and the third gained nine yards and a first down. After that gain, however, Tech lost yardage on a rush by Oxendine, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a loss of nine yards during the third down play. <b>Kibble</b> punted, and Nebraska began at the Tech 45-yard line after the kick was returned 26 yards by Michael Hawkes. The Cornhuskers took quick advantage of the good field position. Ahman Green ran 17 yards for a first down, then Frost passed for 23 yards to Kenny Cheatham, pushing Nebraska inside the Virginia Tech red zone. On just the third play after Virginia Tech's punt, Frost ran the remaining five yards, crossing the goal line for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 9:14 remaining, Nebraska took a 107 lead.|$|E
