5|$|On April5 a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12named storms, 7hurricanes and 3intense hurricanes. The {{decrease in the}} forecast was attributed to the further intensification of El Niño conditions. The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was decreased to 75percent; the East Coast potential decreased slightly to 57percent, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained the same.|$|E
5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable {{that at least}} one major hurricane would directly impact the United States.

5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T.

Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris).

5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due {{to the effect of}} a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 2001, Gray's team issued {{their first}} mid-season {{forecast}} for the 2001 season, keeping the forecast number at 12 named storms, with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming a major hurricane, noting that sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures {{continued to be}} favorable for above-average hurricane activity.

5|$|On December7, 2001, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2002 season, predicting above-average activity (13named storms, 8hurricanes, and about 2 of Category3 or higher).

5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned quickly to the east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E
5|$|Before Alma struck Florida, {{officials}} issued hurricane warnings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Keys through Apalachicola. A hurricane {{watch and}} gale warning were issued for the state's eastern coastline, extending to Savannah, Georgia. In Key West, residents boarded up houses, and about 1,000people {{fled to the}} region's 11shelters. The MIM-23 Hawk antiaircraft missiles in the city were moved to higher ground, having been in place since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Further north, officials ordered the evacuation of Captiva Island and Sanibel Island. The causeways to Sanibel Island were closed, isolating residents who had not evacuated. Ten emergency shelters were opened in Fort Myers and two in Naples. Overall, about 100,000people were advised to seek shelter, though many of them chose {{to stay in their}} homes. All Phantom jet fighters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa were transported to Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, while aircraft were also evacuated from Homestead Air Reserve Base. Because Alma was initially forecast to cross the central portion of the state, residents along the Florida panhandle were not adequately prepared for the hurricane. Just hours before the storm moved ashore, officials ordered evacuations for residents in low-lying areas around Apalachicola.|$|E
5|$|Florida State has {{won three}} {{national}} championships, eighteen conference titles and six division titles along with a playoff appearance.

In 1904 the Florida State football team became the first ever state champions of Florida after beating both the Florida Agricultural College and Stetson University.

5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm. The state also opened all of the school buildings in Dade County as emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ann Davis, who {{had bought}} the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885.

He could not get a clear title, however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898.
