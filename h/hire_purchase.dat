5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate <b>hire</b> <b>purchase</b> agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the <b>Hire</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act 1938.|$|E

40|$|My {{first degree}} work {{concerns}} financial leasing (<b>hire</b> a <b>purchase)</b> of agricultural equipment {{as a means}} of rebuilding agrarian facilities. The subject of my work was the research in two companies, which use financial leasing and one company offering leases. In my work, I want to show the momentary situation in offering <b>hire</b> and <b>purchase</b> in the view of agricultural companies. There is the history and primary structure of <b>hiring</b> <b>purchasing</b> {{in the first part of}} the work. In the second part, a <b>hire</b> <b>purchasing</b> companyn is shown, as well as that companyˇs profits and strategies. For a closer look at opinions and experience of the common companies, I will compare the two companies that I have chosen, to demonstrate their experience with <b>hiring</b> and <b>purchasing.</b> A selleris needed to purchase agrarian equipment. Therefore I will name the two best known sellers and look at their companies, services and guarantees. A more important feature arises from that: warranty service offered by the sellers, which affects is decision of a Czech farmer whether to accept <b>hiring</b> <b>purchase</b> or not. Another part of my work is detailed analysis of a lease (purchase contract). In my opinion, it is very important to study every part of it more deeply...|$|R

Because there is little risk involved for the seller, layaway can be readily offered to those with bad credit.

In 1973, the minimum statutory retirement age was reduced from 65 to 63, while “flexible” retirement was provided for those {{between the ages of}} 63 and 67.

25|$|The {{point about}} {{remoteness}} of damages under s 2(1) was {{treated in the}} controversial case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on <b>hire</b> <b>purchase,</b> from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in the causal chain. But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort of deceit, that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{aimed at}} {{safeguarding}} consumers was also implemented under the Brandt Administration. The consumer's {{right of withdrawal}} in case of <b>hire</b> <b>purchase</b> was strengthened in March 1974, and fixed prices for branded products were abolished by law in January that same year, which meant that manufacturers' recommended prices were not binding for retailers. In addition, a progressive anticartel law was passed. A 1969 law on explosive materials was supplemented by two orders; the first (made in November 1969) establishing a committee of experts for explosive materials, while the second order (made the following month) included details {{for the implementation of}} the law on explosive materials. An Act of December 1959 on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and protection against its dangers was amended by an Act of June 1970 that established a tax levied for the costs for permissions and surveillance measures. The Law on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution and Penalties, passed in March 1971, provided for standardized compensation in certain situations. In addition, the budget for communications was increased.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in {{numerous}} policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of <b>hire</b> <b>purchase</b> borrowers' rights. The historian David Kynaston cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age; her successor as education minister, George Tomlinson, recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date. Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the North Mail, complained in May 1937 that [...] "Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes to do justice to Jarrow". Nevertheless, her book The Town that was Murdered brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes, [...] "educated the nation".|$|E

The flamboyance for which he would later be noted began when a fight broke out during a performance in France by one of his early bands, the V.I.P.s. Instructed by the band to keep playing, he produced some explosion and machine gun sounds with the Hammond organ, which stopped the fight.
