Plans were further <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Mass demonstrations {{took place}} in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for {{recognizing}} Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. US officials were <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations.

50|$|Some {{readers may}} find Messori <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times, as his writing can be gushing and formal. He says things like, “Pardon me, Your Holiness, but my role (which gives me great honor {{but also a}} certain responsibility) is also that of a respectful “provocateur” with regard to questions...”.|$|R

5|$|No Doubt became <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> {{the lack}} of {{progress}} they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs {{to be released in}} an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|Seeking revenge {{after his}} wife Mary was killed by the demon Azazel, John Winchester became a hunter and raised his two sons to fight the supernatural. John disappears early in Supernatural, and the first season {{revolves}} primarily around Sam and Dean trying to find him. Morgan was also filming episodes of Grey's Anatomy while the first season of Supernatural was under production, and future appearances of the character were hindered by his busy schedule. While Morgan's portrayal has been praised, fans and critics were generally <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> the character for keeping so many secrets.|$|E

50|$|Initially a {{traditional}} Afrobeat ensemble, the {{group consisted of}} 14 members from {{various parts of the}} world, {{and as a result of}} a revolving door of musicians coming in and out of the group, the initial months proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> tightening up the group as a live unit. During this time Lugo met English Trombonist Chris Morrow, the only other original member currently in the group.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the novel}} was mixed. Writing in The Independent, Jan Daley described the book as [...] "more admirable than enjoyable" [...] and [...] "without the pulsing immediacy of Coetzee's previous work". Meanwhile, Patrick McGrath, writing for The New York Times, concluded that the novel was [...] "dense and difficult, a novel that <b>frustrates</b> <b>at</b> every turn" [...] and without [...] "any clear narrative resolution".|$|R
5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> {{the time it was}} taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E

MacLachlan stumbled across a Cant Z.506-B bomber of 612 Squadriglia during the sortie which he destroyed. The pilot, Sottotenente Ignazio Rossi {{was killed in}} action. After landing, yet another raid came in. MacLachlan climbed and singled out a Junkers Ju 88 of 8./Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1—Learning Wing 1). The Ju 88 saw him coming and swung around to a head-on position. After a brief turning duel MacLachlan hit the port engine and it crashed into the bay near Zonkor Point. For his actions he was awarded a bar to his DFC on 24 January.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E
50|$|Munin {{received}} mostly average {{or mixed}} reviews from critics. Critics on Metacritic praised the gameplay, but found the graphics and story to be poor.

2500|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, such as lapses {{in the control}} system. The New York Times noted that [...] "...its finicky controls can <b>frustrate</b> <b>at</b> times." [...] Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer found, [...] "There are ... a few occasions where the platforming lets you down ... despite the feeling you were jumping in the right direction." [...] IGN described certain repetitive gunfight sequences as [...] "a little aggravating" [...] and complained about the [...] "very linear" [...] climbing sections, yet calling it a forced complaint.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. Lie on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>at</b> his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>at</b> the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E

She remained an important influence in Peter's life even during college as she was the only family he had left. Her continued belief that Peter was still the fragile boy he'd been before he gained his powers could be <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times.|$|R
5000|$|AdventureGamers awarded it 4 out of 5, {{specifically}} {{praising the}} graphics and artwork, saying [...] "Every pixel has been crafted with care, making for lush, detailed backgrounds and nicely animated characters". The review also praises the fun gameplay with the dialogue puzzles, minigames and riddles, while noting {{the handling of}} the inventory can be quite <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times. Despite small technical issues AdventureGamers recommendsTales, saying: [...] "If you like myths and literature, meaty puzzles, or even just playing with Thor's hammer and Jack's beanstalk, this game comes heartily recommended".|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} been criticized as not being {{original}} enough (compared to its predecessor, Beyond Oasis) to justify its appearance on the Saturn platform. The gameplay was {{also referred to as}} <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times, because its perspective can make it very difficult to tell how high or low a platform is in relation to Leon [...] - [...] it may force him to walk great lengths to get back to where he was prior to jumping up to a platform that is too high. [...] Game Informer gave the game an 8.75/10.|$|R

Nevertheless, Albert is <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household.|$|E

On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets <b>frustrated.</b> <b>At</b> home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E
40|$|Because the {{profession}} of chaplaincy has significant challenges in balancing ones spiritual life while providing spiritual resiliency to ones Soldiers, a chaplain must have an identity that is God centered, self-knowing and Soldier focused. In our stressful military world, we are often pushed and pulled in different ways. At times these ways can be contradictory to previous instructions or require clarification and negotiation to sort them out. It's fair {{to suggest that it}} can be demanding and even <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times. Our identity grounds us in times like these but also tells us who and what we are...|$|R

We had minor hits with [...] "Woman Of The World" [...] and [...] "Devils Ball", but they couldn't compete with The Captain's popularity at all.

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|By 1801, the Armée d'Orient was on {{the verge}} of collapse. No {{supplies}} or support had arrived from France, their commander Jean Baptiste Kléber had been assassinated, and a British invasion was impending. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>at</b> his failure to assist his men in Egypt, Bonaparte ordered a squadron of ships of the line to sail from Brest in January 1801 under the command of Contre-Amiral Honoré Ganteaume. This force was instructed to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean and land over 5,000 troops at Alexandria. In February, Ganteaume's force reached Toulon, the admiral concerned that his ships would be outnumbered further east where the British expeditionary force was gathering. Bonaparte sent him back to sea to complete the operation but again he returned, driven back by bad weather and a patrolling British squadron off Sicily under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. On 27 April Ganteaume made a third attempt to reach Egypt, and reached Benghazi before pressure from larger British forces under Admiral Lord Keith drove his squadron back westwards. On 24 June, Ganteaume's ships were retreating along the North African coast, passing close to Cape Derna.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} <b>frustrated</b> <b>at</b> the lack of progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled {{from the roof of}} the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> first but {{eventually}} we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was universally criticized. Parkin {{called the}} battle gameplay [...] "lightweight" [...] {{and the balance}} between ground and aerial combat poor despite a good character leveling system, while Lewis described it as being without strategy, with the game [...] "just dumping in more boring enemies to wade through". GameTrailers {{said that there was}} [...] "nothing new here.", while Meuller called it [...] "dull <b>at</b> best and <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> worst". 1UP said that the combat was [...] "almost sickening to look at.", though he cited the RPG elements as a redeeming feature. Jarvis simply called the gameplay [...] "Same old, same old", citing it as a major fault of the game.|$|R
500|$|The game Action Button {{described}} as [...] "about keeping {{your eyes on}} balls" [...] was inspired by tennis. It was released with little advanced notice in early November 2012. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer Mark Brown likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a [...] "telekinetic power" [...] to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter). He found the game <b>frustrating</b> <b>at</b> times when unable to control the ball. Though Brown found TNNS fun, different, and addictive, it had [...] "not quite won [...] over".|$|R
