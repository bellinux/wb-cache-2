The basic idea is <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>sequences</b> of suitably modulated coherent light pulses whose energy can be concentrated in a single temporal bin on the receiver side through optical interference. Two examples of scalable architectures for structured receivers are presented. The first one, based on active polarization switching, maps Hadamard codewords composed from the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) constellation onto the standard pulse position modulation (PPM) format. The second receiver, using solely passive optical elements, converts phase-polarization patterns of coherent light pulses into a single pulse preserving a synchronized time of arrival. Such a conversion enables implementation of a communication protocol equivalent to the PPM scheme but with distributed optical power provided that the intersymbol guard-time exceeds the pattern length.

30|$|Besides {{these papers}} on {{strictly}} bandlimited channels, also cases with less strict spectral {{constraints on the}} transmit signal have reported benefits from 1 -bit quantization and oversampling. For example, in [6, 7], where the channel is treated as memoryless, {{it has been observed}} that random processes such as additive noise and intersymbol interference can yield an increase of the achievable rate due to dithering. The same strategy, namely treating the channel as memoryless, has been applied for the utilization of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling [8, 9] for channels with 1 -bit quantization and oversampling at the receiver [10]. An alternative strategy for communication with 1 -bit quantization and oversampling at the receiver is <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>sequences</b> which generate a unique output signal after 1 -bit quantization. In this regard, a waveform design supporting a unique detection of symbols with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) has been proposed in [11]. Without being exhaustive, the named papers show some benefit of oversampling when using 1 -bit channel output quantization. Nevertheless, none of these approaches provide achievable rates comparable to those which are presented in [3] for the noiseless channel.|$|R
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} we wish <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>sequences</b> {{comprising}} the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives {{a way of}} calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|R

30|$|Our N-to-N gossiping {{protocol}} {{consists of}} n nodes, or peers, that operate in cycles. (The terms “peer” and “node” {{will be used}} interchangeably in this paper). Each cycle is initiated at fixed intervals and is identified by a global cycle ID. For simplicity, we assume {{that there is a}} global synchronization of the cycle ID and frame rate, and that this synchronization is achieved through the use of NTP. The use of a global cycle ID eliminates the need of a peer to manage the sequence numbering of sources individually and the need <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>sequence</b> numbers of individual chunks in a packet. Other mechanisms to achieve synchronization are possible but we assume that NTP is used so that we can focus on other aspects of our protocol. Each peer in a cycle can generate at most one information frame (e.g. a voice frame) to be distributed to the remaining n- 1 peers through a multi-phase gossiping mechanism. The key to our protocol is the use of a synchronous global cycle ID and synchronous media generation. By “synchronous media generation” we mean that the packet generation rates are exactly the same for all active nodes. Most N-to-N real-time communication protocols in the literature have either assumed an asynchronous operation or have assumed a synchronous operation without addressing how this synchronicity is achieved. If using asynchronous operation, we would need <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> and process individual sequence numbers as well as to perform frequency alignment across multiple streams. Also, the bundling of information from different sources into one transmitted packet cannot be done in as straightforward a manner - in our protocol, we simply need to bundle information frames with the same cycle ID.|$|R

We use an information-theoretic approach to find the optimal parameters in training-based transmission schemes for channels described by a block-fading model. The optimal length of the training interval is found by maximizing a lower bound on the training-based channel capacity. When the transmitter is capable of providing two distinct transmission power levels (one for training and one for data transmission), the optimal length of the training interval is shown to be equal to the length of the channel. Further, we show that at high SNR, training-based schemes achieve the capacity of block-fading frequency selective channels, whereas at low SNR, they are highly suboptimal...|$|R

Information bits are convolutionally encoded, punctured and permuted, mapped into {{quaternary phase-shift keying}} (QPSK) symbols, linearly modulated, and transmitted through a downward-refracting ocean waveguide. Training symbols are prepended <b>to</b> the <b>transmitted</b> <b>sequence</b> for initial estimation of CMPs. Our algorithm processes data from a single receive sensor.
