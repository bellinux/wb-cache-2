Recent studies of the population size have been done documenting huge colonies of this coral species in most coral growing regions of the world.

The coral grows and propagates rapidly in captive reef environments and thrives under lighting and flow conditions that other Mussidae would not survive. It is best known recently as a [...] "trend coral" [...] that commands high prices in the reef trade that are not related to its rarity, population or accessibility. In the wild, the chief threat it is likely to face is from predation by coral eating organisms such as parrot fish and starfish and the degradation of its reef habitat. It may disappear entirely from some degraded reefs and, along with other coral species, is likely to be adversely affected by ocean acidification and climate change.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{coexistence}} of Controlling and other management methods (benchmarking, BPM, BPR, BSC, Competency-based Management, CRM, ERP, KM, LM, Outsourcing, Six Sigma, TQM) have been analysed. The complexity and dynamics of modern management systems in fact require simultaneous and/or sequential application of many concepts and methods of management. Controlling is a comprehensive method with an interdisciplinary character, which acts as an integrating plane for many methods and techniques. The coexistence of controlling with other management methods depends {{on the type of}} relationship between controlling and these methods. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>main,</b> <b>however,</b> coexistence should be beneficial for an organization. Theoretical concepts on the relations between controlling and other methods are thus empirically tested by analysing the effect of using selected management methods, both in conjunction with controlling, as well as separately (business, efficiency, management, social and environmental effects).

30|$|Clearly, {{this is an}} {{improvement}} on the ‘governance-lite’ GVC approach where control is exerted by multinationals (MNCs) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>main.</b> <b>However,</b> MNCs remain more than significant puppeteers, even in the GPN perspective. Accordingly Gereffi et al. (2005)and GPN suffer from retention of both a (modified) linear view of the phenomenonunder inspectionand an over-emphasis on production in their analyses. This is reminiscent of an older territorial tradition represented {{in the work of}} Vernon (1966) whose emphasis on production in micro-economic dynamics more or less blinded him to the importance of innovation in changing the locational impulse of regional and global economic development (Tichy, 2011). Accordingly, both GVC and GPN approaches to integrating territorial development relations suffer from a failure to appreciate non-linearity in such interactions and the relative rise of innovation as a competitive weapon in comparison with an earlier ‘productivist’ norm emanating from a short period of knowledge leadership by Western MNCs. The GIN approach eschews both linearity and Occidentalist knowledge leadership elements of the new relational space of global innovation. This is particularly pronounced in ICT where we shall see Asian innovation, in particular, leaving the West behind in some, if not yet all, developmental stages.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMuch of {{the cell}} surface on the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila is covered by a {{polarized}} lattice of cytoskeletal structures {{that are associated with}} basal bodies of the ciliary rows. Unique structural landmarks, including an oral apparatus and contractile vacuole pores, develop before cell division in localized domains located, respectively, posterior and anterior to the transverse fission zone. All of these structures can be visualized by specific monoclonal antibodies. A single-locus recessive mutation, disorganized-A (disA), primarily affects the striated rootlets of the ciliary-row basal bodies and brings about a severe disorganization in the positioning and orientation of these basal bodies and associated cytoskeletal elements. Nonetheless, the new oral apparatus, contractile vacuole pores, and other unique structures appeared at or near their normal sites along the anteroposterior axis of disA cells, indicating that the positioning of these localized structures is not dependent on the integrity of the ciliary rows. Abnormalities were present in the details of construction of some of the localized structures and in aspects of cell shape that may be influenced by these details. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>main,</b> <b>however,</b> analysis of disA mutant cells indicates that intracellular domains near the cell poles develop independently of the vectorial polarity of the ciliary rows...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty coded sera, 60 from {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 70 from patients with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding activity by five different types of assay. These were enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (distinguishing IgG and IgM anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA), Crithidia luciliae, a nitrocellulose filter assay, the Amersham kit, and another modified Farr assay, the radioimmunoassay (RIA) (UK). The Crithidia test was the most specific, none of the controls was positive, but the least sensitive (13 % positive only). The RIA (UK) was the most sensitive (57 % positive). In most of the assays 3 - 9 % of the controls were positive. When the SLE sera were analysed according to disease activity the IgG anti-dsDNA ELISA, all three RIA values, and the Crithidia test values were raised in all the patients with severely active disease. Some patients with inactive disease, however, were positive {{in each of the}} tests. The best interassay correlations (r less than 0. 49) were found between RIA (UK), and ss IgG and the Amersham kit; and between ds IgG and ss IgG. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>main,</b> <b>however,</b> it was clear that different assays are dependent upon distinctive properties of DNA antibodies.

Unlike large or charismatic marsupial species, the cryptic nature of bandicoots and bilbies tends {{to keep them out}} of the public eye, at a time when public interest plays a significant role in conservation efforts. The inconspicuous ‘rat-like’ appearance of many bandicoots and a generalist ecological strategy belie a complex biology of adaptive traits and evolutionary diversity.

We also provide a comprehensive review of the fossil records of bandicoots in order to provide an up-to-date platform for future studies. From this work, it is clear that there is still much to be done regarding the taxonomy and biology of these animals before a more detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of this group can be elucidated...|$|E
