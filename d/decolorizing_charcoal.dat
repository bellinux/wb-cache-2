30|$|The waste {{glycerol}} layer (15 mL) {{from the}} biodiesel synthesis was made acidic (pH = 3 - 4) by adding conc. HCl. Once acidic, the glycerol/methanol layer was isolated. The crude, recovered glycerol (10 mL) was then made slightly basic (pH = 6 - 7) {{by adding a}} small amount of KOH and mixed with <b>decolorizing</b> <b>charcoal.</b> The resulting solution was then filtered into a painted round bottom flask and attached to a simple distillation set-up using the solar reflector heat source. Methanol (7 mL) was distilled away from the glycerol solution by heating the solution to 100 °C using solar irradiation. Recovered, pure glycerol (3 mL, 4.094 g) remained in the round bottom flask. 1 H NMR (DMSO-d 6): ? 4.522 (s, 1 H), ? 3.4587 - 3.325. 13 C NMR (DMSO-d 6): δ 72.58, δ 63.13.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} material is tartar {{with a minimum}} tartaric acid content 68 %. This is first dissolved in water or in the mother liquor of a previous batch. It is then saponified with hot caustic soda to pH 8, <b>decolorized</b> with activated <b>charcoal,</b> and chemically purified before being filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to 42 °Bé at 100 °C, and passed to granulators in which Seignette's salt crystallizes on slow cooling. The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a rotary furnace and sieved before packaging. Commercially marketed grain sizes range from 2000 μm to < 250 μm (powder).|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} porosity properties of <b>decolorized</b> activated <b>charcoal</b> {{and its ability}} to adsorb β-carotene. Ability of activated charcoal for β-carotene adsorption in isopropyl alcohol determined at equilibrium conditions, were determined by the duration of adsorption time and activated charcoal concentration. Equilibrium time was determined from 0. 5 to 60 min, concentration of activated charcoal was determined from 0. 5 to 2. 5 %. Isothermal adsorption determined at β-carotene concentrations of 100 - 500 ppm with adsorption temperature of 30, 40 and 50 °C at the equilibrium. The results showed that the activated charcoal used in this study had a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1068. 391 m 2 /g, total pore volume of 0. 9523 cc/g, mesopore volume of 0. 528 cc/g, mesopore volume/total pore volume as much as 55. 4 %, and mesopore radius of 15. 26 Å. Based on content of β-carotene adsorbed into activated charcoal, adsorption equilibrium was reached after 5 min adsorption. Activated charcoal at a concentration of 1, 5 % able to adsorb β-carotene optimally. Adsorption of β-carotene at 40 °C for 60 min according to Freundlich adsorption model with coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 999), intensity of adsorption (1 /n = 1. 0024) and Freundlich adsorption capacity (KF= 63. 358 L/mg). Whereas adsorption of β-carotene at 50 °C for 60 min according to Langmuir isotherm model with coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 969), adsorption capacity (b = 33. 206 mg/g) and adsorption at equilibrium (Kb = 1. 721 L/mg) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Bacillus subtilis α-amylase {{was used}} to hydrolyze starch from peeled and whole {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum). Effect of gelatinization temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, temperature of hydrolysis and presence of calcium ions were investigated. Optimum conditions for hydrolysis were when α-amylase levels were 0. 3 percent of the starch concentration {{in the presence of}} 400 ppm calcium at pH 7. 0 and 80 °C for 2 hr. After centrifugation to remove residual material, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 with 30 percent sulfuric acid and heated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate α-amylase. Treatment with four percent activated <b>charcoal</b> <b>decolorized</b> the clear hydrolysate before the product was spray dried. The dried product was a light yellow powder, slightly sweet, relatively bland in taste and readily soluble in water. Dried potato hydrolysate made from peeled potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 30 and contained 85 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 5. 5 percent ash; while the hydrolysate from whole potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 26 and contained 86 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 6. 0 percent ash. The composition of the carbohydrates of the two hydrolysates were similar except the hydrolysate from peeled contained a higher concentration of glucose and lower concentration of saccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than four. At concentrations of greater than 40 percent, the potato hydrolysate made from whole potatoes did not show as high a viscosity as commercial corn syrup solids with a dextrose equivalent of 24; the potato hydrolysate adsorbed twice as much moisture as the commercial corn syrup solids at 75 percent relative humidity at 23 °C for 30 days. Substitution of sucrose with whole potato hydrolysate in chocolate milk revealed that substitution of two parts of sucrose by two parts of potato hydrolysate could be used with a slight loss of desirability. Fifty and one hundred percent addition of whole potato hydrolysate to a commercial dehydrated vegetable soup mix showed no decrease in the desirability of the product. This work has shown that a useful potato hydrolysate containing significant amounts of protein can be prepared from either peeled or whole potatoes...|$|R
