5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E

5|$|Because of Bangladesh's meagre batting performance, the Australian innings began {{before lunch}} and opener Adam Gilchrist scored a {{typically}} quick-fire 18 {{before he was}} caught behind from Mortaza. Hayden (46) and Ponting then got valuable batting practice as they shared a 74-run partnership. Ponting was eventually bowled by Rafique for 29. Damien Martyn's stay at the crease was cut short, in his first International match since breaking his <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he faced just one ball before Australia won by eight wickets with more than 27 overs to spare. Along with the wicket of Ponting, Rafique conceded just seven runs in five overs.|$|E
5|$|Clippard began 2007 {{with the}} Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, {{striking}} out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the starting rotation, they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard. When Darrell Rasner broke his <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> May, Clippard was called up to New York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and Jeff Karstens.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

In 1952, he was 7–12 with a 3.74 earned run average in 26 games, 22 of them starts. He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season; however, he {{suffered}} from bone spurs in his pitching arm.

5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E

40|$|A loss of {{functional}} motor axons in the median and ulnar nerves occurred in half of thirty-three patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Weakness of small hand muscles may predispose {{to the development}} of ulnar deviation of the <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> patients with joint disease at the radio-ulnar and metacarpo-phalangeal joints. There is no evidence that spasm of small hand muscles is a significant cause of ulnar deviation of the <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> rheumatoid arthritis. Ulnar deviation of the <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> rheumatoid arthritis is not due to selective impair-ment of the ulnar nerve or the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve even though ulnar deviation of the <b>fingers</b> can occur <b>in</b> association with such lesions {{and in the absence of}} joint disease...|$|R

The next day, a film extra (Gene Simmons) confesses to the killings; Black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed—and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their throats cut, while Winston's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder-suicide.|$|E
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{broke his}} nose at Craven Cottage on {{the opening day of}} the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E

5|$|Ingham was capped {{once for}} Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only {{appearance}} in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career {{at this level}} concluded with four caps. Ingham was called into the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was called into the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E
