In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, {{although}} Ellie and Valli had married and {{moved out of the}} first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Lambert {{received}} a message from Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if Lambert refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty, Lambert agreed to the terms. Lambert later received a message from Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept {{the terms of the}} surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.|$|E

Additionally, the station broadcasts First Business with news of the Chicago Board of Trade. Former WVON-AM radio personality Don Cornelius began the popular dance show Soul Train <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> studio on the 43rd floor in 1970. When Cornelius moved the show to Los Angeles a year later, his assistant, Clinton Ghent took over the local show until it ended in 1976.

His next movement was to take from his pocket a small, thick book of blank paper, to produce a pencil, and to begin to write <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramp,</b> compact hand.

Lillard informed Palmer that while working <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> area seventeen years earlier, he felt a 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer’s examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.|$|E

They began venturing outside of Illinois to play shows in Madison, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Muncie, {{transporting}} themselves and their equipment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> car and sleeping on people's floors. Albini handled much of the band's logistics himself, setting up rehearsals, booking studio time, and arranging tours. With their reputation growing through small tours, {{he was able to}} set up a run of East Coast dates including performances in Washington, D.C. and Boston and at New York City's Danceteria, followed by a European tour on which they won acclaim in the United Kingdom's music press. Big Black simultaneously found themselves gaining popularity in their hometown, but felt embittered that the same locals who had snubbed them just months before were suddenly interested now that they had built a reputation outside the city, and the band actually refused to play in Chicago for some time.|$|E

25|$|Clarkson {{describes}} {{one of her}} earliest memories as that {{of hiding}} in several Hong Kong basements during the Japanese invasion of the territory in 1941. It was only through his Canadian government connections that her father gained his family the opportunity in 1942 to flee the occupation to Canada, {{as part of the}} repatriating of Canadian government staff from the fallen city. Even so, the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, prevented the Poys' immediate entry into the country until the Department of External Affairs intervened and cited an unfilled quota in the prisoner of war exchange programme with the Japanese Imperial Forces that would permit the Poy family free passage into Canada. The family settled in Ottawa, though William had lost almost all of his substantial fortune, and the Poys lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> duplex. Clarkson attended public school in the city and, in October 1951, was lined up with her class to see Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), as the royal motorcade passed through the city.|$|E
25|$|Lazaret or a {{quarantine}} {{hospital is}} {{not mentioned in}} the documents, but it is safe to presume {{that it had to be}} formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> space, the triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to bury them. Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties.|$|E
25|$|Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who {{was sent}} on the Royal Navy's {{expedition}} to the South Pacific to find the mutineers {{and bring them to}} trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from Bounty who were captured by Edwards' men were confined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on Pandoras quarterdeck. Yet, when Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer's mate went into the cell to knock off the prisoners' irons. But before he could finish the job, the ship sank very quickly. Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel.|$|E

500|$|The {{camera and}} its film {{magazines}} with an {{inertial navigation system}} were carried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> [...] "Q-bay" [...] below the drone's air intake.

The hatch would be ejected {{at the end of the}} mission and then snagged out of the air by a JC-130 Hercules, a technique that had been developed by the Air Force to recover film canisters from satellites. If the C-130 missed, the hatch was equipped with flotation devices so it could be recovered by ship if released over water. Honeywell built the avionics systems; new construction techniques and materials had to be developed for the systems to withstand the high temperatures, extreme vibrations, and lack of space in the D-21.|$|E
500|$|In July 1931 as a {{steam shovel}} was making ready to level enough land to {{accommodate}} the great castle, Hearst {{put a stop to}} all his construction plans. The Great Depression had greatly diminished his income, and he could not pay for his $50million project at Wyntoon {{while at the same time}} indulging his expansion at San Simeon. Abandoning the massive castle idea, Hearst instead asked Morgan to design a [...] "Bavarian Village" [...] with multiple half-timbered buildings in the medieval style of Germany or Austria. Hearst sent Morgan to Europe to study suitable buildings; she brought fine artist Doris Day with her to investigate architectural inscriptions and painting styles. In 1932, Morgan put together a master plan for Wyntoon. It described a group of guesthouses with romantic names such as Cinderella House, Fairy House and Bear House, arranged not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> medieval style but symmetrically around a common green in the Beaux-Arts style. These three-story structures with steeply gabled roofs were completed in 1933. Swiss artisan Jules Suppo and his assistants carved much of the German Gothic decorations. Day painted fine inscriptions and exterior decorative patterns. Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany painted exterior murals depicting Russian and Germanic fairy tales such as those from the Brothers Grimm, but Pogany's versions were bright, humorous and cheerful, not dark and grim.|$|E

2500|$|As choirmaster, Augustinussen was {{entitled}} to a municipal curate's farm at Sandenes {{at the end of}} Ranfjorden. However, he chose to live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cramped</b> apartment in the school building. The school building was in 1856 (after renovations in 1853) 20,5 x 9 ells. On the ground floor were the teaching room, kitchen and parlor for the curate, while the rooms on the first floor were used for housing. Originally there was a dormitory in the attic for pupils who lived far away. It was used as a school building up until 1886, and then became housing for the curate. After becoming a pensioner in 1878, Augustinussen built himself a private residential block on the west wall of the teaching room where he lived {{for the rest of his}} life. This house has since been moved a little away. Both the schoolhouse and Augustinussen's house still stand at Nesna. The schoolhouse is considered to be [...] "the region's oldest building for permanent, organized teaching for the common people".|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1920s {{the sheer volume}} of traffic in the {{movement}} of coal, and the corresponding flow of empty wagons, had created serious problems on the branch once again, this time complicated by the passenger service.

During the summer there was the problem of loaded wagons of coal awaiting orders.

Many of his works featured an individual or individuals placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>cramped</b> space, which had a distinct psychological impact on viewers.
