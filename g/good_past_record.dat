40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the motives of}} high-tech acquirers by analysing their revealed preferences {{in terms of the}} high-tech companies they acquire. Using a large sample of acquisitions involving publicly traded firms from various countries we ask whether high technology acquisitions are best understood in terms of acquirers seeking to source externally special innovation-related assets by acquiring firms with “superior ” innovative performance; or acquirers seeking to acquire firms with “inferior ” innovative performance in order to turn them around. We find evidence that acquisition is a very noisy phenomenon and that economic and innovation related variables explain only a modest part of the probability of becoming a target. We do however find that, compared to nonacquired firms, high-tech targets tend to be somewhat larger, to have poorer profitability, lower Tobin’s q and liquidity. In relation to their innovative profile, targets, in general, seem to have a relatively larger stock of accumulated knowledge (stock of citation-weighted patents), relatively higher R&D inputs (R&D-intensity), but {{they are more likely to}} generate no R&D output (citationweighted patent-intensity) before they are acquired. We conclude that high technology acquisitions reflect a process which is primarily driven by acquirers wishing to exploit the potential for turning around firms which, despite a <b>good</b> <b>past</b> <b>record,</b> appear to be innovatively and economically inefficient before they are acquired...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{methods and}} techniques for measuring and evaluating {{performance for the}} purpose of controlling the investment process. However, many of the methods discussed in this chapter are also used in communicating investment performance between the investment management company and it’s (potential) customers. Therefore, performance measurements also {{play an important role in}} the competition between investments management companies. Substantial evidence from the net sales of mutual funds shows that investors buy mutual funds with <b>good</b> <b>past</b> performance <b>records</b> although they fail to sell funds with bad past performance. ...|$|R
50|$|Blame for Beatty's light cruisers' having {{disengaged}} {{from the}} enemy, initially fell upon their commander, Goodenough but {{the action was}} contrary to his <b>past</b> <b>good</b> <b>record.</b> Blame eventually settled on the confused signals, which had been drafted by Lieutenant Commander Ralph Seymour. Seymour remained flag officer to Beatty and continued in the same vein, making costly mistakes at both the Battle of Dogger Bank and at Jutland. A new order was drafted to captains to double check any orders to disengage if involved in a winnable battle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{subsequent}} inquiry by the Chief Harbourmaster, Captain C J Irvine, {{established that}} the master, Captain Rees, had mistaken the mark buoy in {{the north side of}} the channel leading to Denham for the outer or westerly buoy. In the hazy prevailing weather, Captain Rees had been prevented from verifying his position by bearings from the headlands, and there was little warning of the approach of shoal waters. The Chief Harbourmaster therefore concluded that more care should have been exercised when approaching Bar Flats, and the speed of the ship reduced to [...] "slow" [...] until the vessels position had been definitely ascertained. However, in light of Captain Reess <b>past</b> <b>good</b> <b>record,</b> and in the absence of any damage to the ship, he recommended that no further action be taken.|$|R

He went on to make his full debut in the opening fixture of the 2008-09 season against Birmingham City.He was sent off during a game against Coventry City after a lunging tackle from behind on opposing player Michael Mifsud. The Football Association charged him for his behavior after receiving a red card even with his <b>past</b> <b>good</b> disciplinary <b>record</b> and handed him an additional one-match ban. Having played regularly until November he succumbed to an injury and subsequently failed to force his {{way back into the}} first team and made only a handful of appearances in the FA Cup {{in the second half of}} the season. Sun was then released from his contract in July 2009 with Sheffield United claiming he had [...] "failed to settle" [...] in Yorkshire.|$|R

In contrast, this deal leads to more value creation for chaebol-affiliated acquirers than other types of acquirers. Furthermore, well-performing chaebol-affiliated acquirers experience a larger wealth loss than other types of acquirers if they buy securities from poorly performing issuers in the same chaebol.
