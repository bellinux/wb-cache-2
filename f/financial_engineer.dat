40|$|Both {{finance and}} {{construction}} of major projects have dramatically evolved {{in the past ten}} years. Technological breakthrough such as computer orientated design, new cements, new machines have led to a more efficient production process. In the mean time, project financing has been greatly advanced and new techniques have appeared. Large and complex projects have started to be partially funded by the private sector {{as a result of the}} will to cut public spending. Indeed, States and governments realized that the returns should be taken more seriously in publicly supported infrastructure projects. To make many projects bankable, new mixes of public-private partnership with new financing schemes have been developed. <b>Financial</b> <b>engineers</b> have developed new securities, backed by the future stream of cash flows generated by the project income. Those securities, enhanced by risk-specialized agencies, will maybe constitute a major innovation and will allow <b>financial</b> <b>engineers</b> to access a new set of investors: small bondholders.

40|$|Survivorship {{is a risk}} of {{considerable}} importance to developed economies. Survivor derivatives are in their early stages and manage a risk which is arguably more serious than that managed by credit derivatives. This paper takes the approach developed by Dowd et al.

It concludes by considering applications for these products by hedgers and <b>financial</b> <b>engineers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} that markets are positive linear structures moving toward stable fixed-point equilibria is not supproted by empirical investigations. This note reformulates the purest and the simplestof all Walrasian models, i. e.,a pure exchange economy, and shows that even {{such a simple}} market moves toward a compact time-invariant set of prices due to the constant destruction and creation of excess demands under the impulsion of self-interested agents with strong monotone preferences. Fractal attractors better explain continuous market fluctuations, 'black swans', and the flawed risk assessments of market risks of the <b>financial</b> <b>engineers</b> of Wall Street. ...|$|R
