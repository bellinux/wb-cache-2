40|$|Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) {{are unique}} {{structures}} {{characteristic of the}} group of unconventional slow infections which includes scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A major component of hamster fibrils {{has been described as a}} protease-resistant glycoprotein with an apparent mol. wt of 27, 000 - 30, 000 (PrP 27 - 30). However, we report here that if fibrils are prepared by procedures designed to minimise proteolysis the <b>PrP</b> <b>proteins</b> co-purifying with hamster SAF have mol. wts of 33, 000 - 35, 000 (PrP 33 - 35) and 26, 000 - 29, 000 (PrP 26 - 29). We find a Lys-Lys-Arg-Pro-Lys sequence at the amino terminus of these SAF proteins, that is absent from PrP 27 - 30, and which has recently been predicted to be the N-terminal sequence of the native <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> of uninfected brain. The major SAF <b>protein</b> (<b>PrP</b> 33 - 35) and its normal brain homologue are shown to have the same apparent mol. wt and ionic charge distribution by two-dimensional gel analysis, silver staining and immunoblotting. These results support our view that PrP 33 - 35 and the normal brain <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> may have the same covalent structure, and that the <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> is recruited into these amyloid-like SAF or into association with a non-protein component of SAF by an irreversible event initiated directly or indirectly by scrapie infection...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{have been used}} to investigate the roles of the yeast U 5 snRNP <b>protein</b> <b>PRP</b> 8 in spliceosome assembly: genetic depletion of <b>PRP</b> 8 <b>protein</b> in vivo, heat inactivation of temperature-sensitive <b>prp</b> 8 <b>protein</b> in protoplasts and inhibition of PRP 8 function with antibodies in vitro. In each case, U 5 and U 4 /U 6 snRNPs failed to assemble into the forming spliceosomes. In addition, extract prepared from PRP 8 -depleted cells and extract containing inactivated <b>PRP</b> 8 <b>protein</b> had substantially reduced amounts of U 4 /U 6. U 5 triple snRNP complexes. Thus, functional <b>PRP</b> 8 <b>protein</b> is required for the stable formation of U 4 /U 6. U 5 complexes without which spliceosomes fail to form. As spliceosome formation was also blocked by anti-PRP 8 antibodies that apparently do not disrupt triple snRNPs, <b>PRP</b> 8 <b>protein</b> may play a separate role in the assembly of triple snRNPs into spliceosomes. As a consequence of PRP 8 depletion the levels of the U 4, U 5 and U 6 snRNAs declined dramatically. We discuss this {{in the context of the}} known genetic interactions between PRP 8 and putative RNA helicase (DEAD box protein) genes and propose that <b>PRP</b> 8 <b>protein</b> plays a role in regulating dynamic RNA-RNA interactions in spliceosome assembly, possibly ensuring the correct directionality of these events...|$|R

40|$|The {{incubation}} period of scrapie in sheep {{is controlled by}} the Sip gene which has two alleles (sA and pA). Following experimental challenge with SSBP/ 1 scrapie, a short {{incubation period}} is conferred by the partially dominant sA allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the scrapie-associated fibril <b>protein</b> (<b>PrP)</b> gene are associated with the Sip alleles. By sequencing the protein coding region of the PrP gene in Cheviot sheep selected for differing Sip genotypes, we have found four <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> variants which differ at three positions: amino acid 112 (Ala/Val), amino acid 130 (Arg/His) and amino acid 147 (Arg/Gln). The Val 112 variant can be distin-guished at the DNA level by an RspXI restriction site which is not present in the Ala l l 2 form. Val l l 2 appears to be linked to a short incubation period of experimentally induced scrapie in the Cheviot sheep and therefore with the Sip sA allele.

40|$|To {{characterize}} sequences in the RNA helicase-like <b>PRP</b> 2 <b>protein</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that are}} essential for its function in pre-mRNA splicing, a pool of random PRP 2 mutants was generated. A dominant negative allele was isolated which, when overexpressed in a wild-type yeast strain, inhibited cell growth by causing a defect in pre-mRNA splicing. This defect was partially alleviated by simultaneous co-overexpression of wild-type PRP 2. The dominant negative <b>PRP</b> 2 <b>protein</b> inhibited splicing in vitro and caused the accumulation of stalled splicing complexes. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PRP 2 antibodies confirmed that dominant negative <b>PRP</b> 2 <b>protein</b> competed with its wild-type counterpart for interaction with spliceosomes, with which the mutant protein remained associated. The PRP 2 -dn 1 mutation led to a single amino acid change within the conserved SAT motif that in the prototype helicase eIF- 4 A is required for RNA unwinding. Purified dominant negative <b>PRP</b> 2 <b>protein</b> had approximately 40 % of the wild-type level of RNA-stimulated ATPase activity.

We searched for evidence of cooperative function between yeast U 2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and several genetically identified splicing (<b>Prp)</b> <b>proteins</b> required for the first chemical step of splicing, using the phenotype of synthetic lethality. We constructed yeast strains with pairwise combinations of 28 different U 2 alleles with 10 prp mutations and found lethal double-mutant combinations with prp 5, - 9, - 11, and - 21 but not with prp 3, - 4, - 8, or - 19. Many U 2 mutations in highly conserved or invariant RNA structures show no phenotype in a wild-type PRP background but render mutant prp strains inviable, suggesting that the conserved but dispensable U 2 elements are essential for efficient cooperative function with specific <b>Prp</b> <b>proteins.</b> Mutant U 2 snRNA fails to accumulate in synthetic lethal strains, demonstrating that interaction between U 2 RNA and these four <b>Prp</b> <b>proteins</b> contributes to U 2 snRNP assembly or stability.

Material and methods: A blood sample was obtained from 50 individuals pertaining to four families affected by CJD. DNA from peripheral mononuclear cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for the gene that codifies <b>PrP</b> <b>protein.</b> Results: In family A, 21 of 23 members were homozygotes for codon 129 (Met/Met) and eight were simultaneously heterozygotes for codon 200 (Glu/Lys). In family B, six of nine members were homozygotes for codon 129, five were heterozygotes for codon 200 and four had both mutations. In family C, the four analyzed subjects were homozygotes for codon 129 and two were simultaneously heterozygotes for codon 200.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that some cattle affected by {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) showed distinct molecular features of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) in Western blot, with a 1 – 2 kDa higher apparent molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrPres associated with labelling by antibodies against the 86 – 107 region of the bovine <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> (H-type BSE). By Western blot analyses of PrPres, we now showed that the essential features initially described in cattle were observed with a panel of different antibodies and were maintained after transmission of the disease in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. In addition, antibodies against the C-terminal region of PrP revealed a second, more C-terminally cleaved, form of PrPres (PrPres # 2), which, in unglycosylated form, migrated as a ≈ 14 kDa fragment. Furthermore, a PrPres fragment of ≈ 7 kDa, which was not labelled by C-terminus-specific antibodies and was thus presumed to be a product of cleavage at both N- and C-terminal sides of <b>PrP</b> <b>protein,</b> was also detected. Both PrPres # 2 and ≈ 7 kDa PrPres were detected in cattle and in C 57 Bl/ 6 infected mice. These complex molecular features are reminiscent of findings reported in human prion diseases.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to characterize the functional domains of a protein in vivo.

When used as a genetic screen to dissect the budding yeast PRP 8 gene, this showed that <b>Prp</b> 8 <b>protein</b> could be dissected into three distinct pairs of functional polypeptides.

50|$|Diseases of {{abnormal}} polymerization are said the undergo “replication”, or rather {{that the number}} of proteins that are polymerized is shown to generally increase much like in a natural course of infection. Since the functional “pathogens” of DAPs are protein units the diseases are almost entirely independent from the use of nucleic acids. Multiple models illustrating this recruitment function exist, including the <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> in prion disease. The <b>PrP</b> <b>protein</b> is the major agent in spongiform encephalopathies and undergoes a clear process of polymerization based upon the natural balancing of thermodynamic states and kinetic summation. Like most <b>proteins</b> <b>PrP</b> can exist in two forms, one major and one minor, an alpha helix structure and a beta-pleated sheet structure respectively, that are balanced during nearly all conditions, but with dominance granted to the stable helix form. In certain instances, it may be possible for two beta forms to contact each other at the same time, and in this case the pair can form bonds that successfully stabilize the beta forms thermodynamically and allowing these structures to remain. This is termed the “seed” of polymerization as from this point the continued interaction, or recruitment, amongst the beta forms is increased perpetually, since there is a constant presence of stable beta forms, as well as the fact that beta forms, or beta-pleated sheets, have a greater number of reactive nucleation sites. This progression forms extended fibrils slowly over time that will then cause localized cytopathology, resulting in the characteristic sites of cell degradation or “sponginess”. This general template of recruitment is also characteristic in the condition sickle cell anemia in which the red blood cells are misshapen because of the formation of extended polymer fibrils.|$|R
