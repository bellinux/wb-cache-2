50|$|Modern {{installations}} of guardrail {{are designed}} to allow the <b>guiderail</b> to deform under the load of the crash, and safely redirecting a vehicle back onto the roadway at a somewhat shallow angle. It {{is important that the}} approach grades to a guardrail system be very flat (typically 10:1 or flatter) and that grades and fixed objects behind guardrail be placed at a distance so that it will not affect the performance of the guardrail upon impact and deflection.|$|E
5000|$|Absorption is {{when the}} force of impact is {{directly}} transferred between the vehicle and guardrail, which may cause the end to puncture the vehicle. This is most common where a [...] "whale tail" [...] or blunt end treatment exists. To mitigate this a number of <b>guiderail</b> end treatments exist such as [...] "Extruder end treatments", [...] "eccentric loaders" [...] and [...] "Driveway wrap treatments" [...] which result in blunt ends rarely being left exposed in modern installations.|$|E
5000|$|According to the US Federal Highway Administration, [...] "The terms {{guardrail}} and <b>guiderail</b> are synonymous, and {{are used}} in different regions around the country." [...] Guide rail and guard rail are intended to steer and [...] "guide" [...] vehicles back onto the road. Since guard rails are designed to keep vehicles safe, and were not designed to guard vehicles from going off the roadway, {{one could argue that}} the most technically correct name when referring to road-side rails is guide rail.According to Cornell University’s Local Roads Program, “Quick Bites” (January 2003), titled Guide Rails: Introduction, “The purpose of guide rail is to protect vehicle occupants from roadside hazards, like drop-offs or fixed objects.” ...|$|E

50|$|Each troop {{transport}} is {{a motion}} simulator which travels at a maximum speed {{of just over}} 14 mph atop a slotted roadbed / <b>guiderail</b> track. The transport car body is attached by three hydraulic rams to {{the frame of the}} chassis, which allows the shell to articulate independently. A guest's physically intense experience is programmed to achieve the illusion of greater speed and catastrophic mechanical failure using the enhanced-motion vehicle's ability to add several feet of lift then rapidly descend, shudder and tremble, and intensify cornering with counterbank and twist.

50|$|Records {{show that}} {{approximately}} {{one hundred and}} sixty-seven Streco Turnpike Cruisers were built, and fourteen amusement parks {{are known to have}} ordered the cars, which were powered by single-cylinder Kohler Company K-Series engines through matched centrifugal clutches at governed speeds of approximately six to eight miles per hour in single file along pre-fixed guideways and/or on winding pathways and, in some parks, with a fixed center <b>guiderail</b> to limit lateral motion. Streco Turnpike Cruiser bodies were constructed of solid fiberglass, and featured prominent tailfins (in conjunction with the fashion of the period), and also full wraparound bumpers for driver/passenger protection. The first series Streco cars were distinguished by standard twin-headlamp configurations, with the more rugged second series cars distinguishable by their quad headlamps.|$|E
5000|$|The Enhanced Motion Vehicles (EMV) are {{intended}} to appear as a battered military troop transport or [...] "Time Rover". EMVs are driven less than 14 mph by air filled tractor trailer tires atop {{the surface of a}} slotted roadbed. Beneath the slot, a tubular <b>guiderail</b> guides the front wheelset and is responsible for supplying power to the vehicle, which is 480 volts in three phase, with a capacity of 200 Amps. The power is divided among the communications, control, safety, audio systems and the two motion systems - propulsion and hydraulics. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind non-operational steering wheel. In addition to the three bus bars for power, there are three additional bus bars, one for a [...] "GO" [...] signal, one for a [...] "NOGO" [...] signal, and one for ground.|$|E
50|$|At {{the south}} end of the west {{elevation}} is the current main entrance. It has a porch with a concrete deck, metal staircase and <b>guiderails.</b> Its roof is done in beaded wood paneling similar to that once used inside the school. The surrounding masonry work is different since the door was added later. Fenestration on that side consists of three aligned pairs of double-hung sash windows, one-over-one at the basement and first story, and two six-over-ones flanking a wooden door on the second.|$|R
2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own <b>guiderails.</b> It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).|$|R
50|$|In {{the time}} since the Morgantown system was installed, general {{technological}} improvements {{have led to a}} number of ways to lower the cost of a PRT system. One of the simplest but most profound way was the development of more efficient, reliable and quick-charging battery systems. Older PRT systems used electricity fed from track-side conductors like a conventional metro, but they can be eliminated in favour of batteries that quickly charge up at stations or small charging strips along the route. Another change is the moving of the guidance logic from centralised computers to on-board systems of dramatically improved performance, allowing the vehicles to steer and switch themselves between routes on their own. That eliminates the need for a track-mounted <b>guiderail</b> able to steer the vehicle (see, for instance, the Ford ACT). Together, the changes mean the vehicle no longer needs strong mechanical contact with the guideway, which can be dramatically reduced in complexity.|$|E
5000|$|Median {{barriers}} can {{be divided}} into three basic categories: rigid barrier systems, semi-rigid barrier systems, and flexible barrier systems. Rigid barrier systems are made up of concrete and are the most common barrier type in use today (e.g. Jersey barrier or concrete step barrier). They are the most costly to install, but have relatively low life-cycle costs, making them economically viable over time. The second barrier type, semi-rigid, is commonly known as guardrail or <b>guiderail</b> barriers. The initial installation of this type can reach as much as $100,000 per mile. [...] These more forgiving barriers are meant to absorb the impact of an accident, and as a result, increase the cost of their life-cycle with each crash and each repair. The third median barrier type is the flexible barrier systems (e.g. cable barriers). Cable barriers are the most forgiving and the least expensive to install, but have high life-cycle costs due to repair needs after crashes. On the other hand, they have been shown to have calculated cost benefits calculating to as much as $420,000 per mile annually. [...] Much cheaper collision reduction methods are to improve road markings, to reduce speeds and to separate traffic with wide central hatching.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates and {{establishes a}} system for monitoring the <b>guiderail</b> wear on medium size CNC machines. The system possesses the function of measuring the wear state on guiderails in an in-process way, which is more functional and efficient than the traditional method. In this research, {{two different types of}} sensors for monitoring each particular friction wear feature have been implemented. Calculations to complete designing of a physical experimental rig and the realisation of in-process monitoring are also discussed in detail. The first type sensor adopted in the experiment is the accelerometer, used for monitoring the vibration caused by the wear on bearings and the increasing roughness on the <b>guiderail</b> surface. The second sensor is the capacitance probe mounted on the table and against a straight edge, searching the deviation signal of the moving table while rolling on the <b>guiderail</b> surface with wear. The novelty of this thesis covering an in-process monitoring approach has been tested based on a physical experimental rig. The data calculation illustrates how the noise and other disturbances are filtered and data analysed to determine the state of wear. This system utilises an indirect solution to wear monitoring with less cost while delivering convincing reliability according to the experiment result. The thesis shows the possibility to acquire CNC machine <b>guiderail</b> wear data through an in-process monitoring system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It {{presents}} the parallel mechanism and variable acceleration control method, which {{is composed of}} slider, connecting rod, moving platform and linear guide etc. The motion platform is supported by three connecting rods through hinging, {{the other end of}} the connecting rods are respectively hinged with two sliders. Among them two pairs of connecting rod, two sliders and the moving platform formed a symmetric structure that is the so called Parallel Mechanism. The third connecting rod is parallel to one of two connecting rods, so that the two parallel connecting rods, slide block and the moving platform formed a parallelogram structure, it makes that the moving platform is always parallel to liner <b>guiderail</b> in the process of movement. By controlling the two sliders moving in the way of variable acceleration, it can make the trajectory curve, speed curve and acceleration curve of the moving platform are continuous, smooth, so impact and vibration of the moving platform is limited in the operation process...|$|E
