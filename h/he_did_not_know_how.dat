He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to facilitate this.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, the United States Department of War {{announced}} {{they would take}} over both classroom space and athletic facilities at 271 colleges and universities to be utilized for the training of United States Army soldiers. As part of the Department's order, only students under 18 {{years of age or}} those with 4-F draft classifications were permitted to compete in intercollegiate athletics. At the time of the announcement, coach Thomas was quoted as saying:"Army–Navy programs not figured at all in our plans for athletics next fall."As such, preparations continued towards fielding a team for the 1943 season. On March 8, spring practice commenced at Denny Stadium and 55 student-athletes reported the first day. At that time coach Thomas acknowledged <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many of his players would be eligible to play in the fall due to rules the prohibited active-duty servicemen playing intercollegiate football. As they entered practice, only 15 lettermen returned to the squad from the 1942 team. These players included: Jack Aland, Johnny August, Bill Baughman, Andy Bires, Charley Compton, Ted Cook, Leon Fichman, Ted McKosky, Jim McWhorter, Norman Mosley, Mitchell Olenski, Kenny Reese, Lou Scales, John Staples and Don Whitmire. Two weeks into the practices, coach Thomas held the first scrimmage of the spring on March 22.|$|E

5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk. While sitting by the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people {{and the story of}} this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E

5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to accomplish what he had seen. The result {{was a mixture of}} original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E

He was always striving to attain it. The life that was so swiftly expanding within him, urged him continually toward the wall of light. The life that was within him knew that it was the one way out, the way he was predestined to tread.

25|$|William Herschel, {{previously}} a clarinet player, of Bath discovered {{infrared radiation}} on 11 February 1800, {{and the planet}} Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the reflecting telescope by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way was a disc, which he called a grindstone, and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that {{that was all the}} universe contained; he had noticed other nebulas but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did Edwin Hubble realise that these nebulas (Andromeda Galaxy) were other galaxies. The Herschel Space Observatory was launched by ESA in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he sent a letter to Harry Wexler who then developed the first weather satellite TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20 million years old, which he knew had to be older than that; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how,</b> and that mass was lost; nuclear fission was only considered in 1933.

Howarth considered Todd's rationale for raping Marty to be complex. [...] "Todd was in love with Marty," [...] he said. When Marty rejects Todd's romantic advances after their one-night stand, it is because he was cold to her that same night after they had sex. Marty's rejection upsets Todd and it festers.
