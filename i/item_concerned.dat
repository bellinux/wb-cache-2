Completing vocational training and a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school also had a highly significant positive effect on knowledge of macroeconomics.

40|$|The self-report Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI), in 30 - and 10 -item versions, {{provides}} unique {{information of}} clinical relevance for monitoring treatment adherence among people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The {{primary purpose of}} this paper was to evaluate the 10 -item version among patients living in sheltered housing. Data were collected among 68 persons living in sheltered housing, most of them (82 %) diagnosed with schizophrenia, 6 % with non-organic psychoses, and 12 % with other diagnoses. The dichotomic response format of the original DAI- 10 was replaced by a 4 -point Likert scale, in order to improve the resolution of the scale. Over 90 % of the participants produced meaningful scores. A factor analysis suggested a 2 -factor orthogonal structure: one highly homogenous factor (5 items) reflected wanted effects of the drug and displayed a bimodal distribution; one factor (3 items) reflected side effects. One <b>item</b> <b>concerned</b> the perceived control over one's drug treatment, which is a key clinical issue. One item was conceptually ambiguous and displayed no correlations with the other items. On the basis of the results we suggest cut-off scores which indicate the need for three kinds of adherence-improving interventions. Summing up, by dropping one item and using a Likert scale response format, the resulting instrument, DAI- 9, appears to be an easy-to-use self-report instrument for monitoring drug attitudes and to identify needs for treatment adherence interventions among seriously ill patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and hypothesis: To {{identify}} practice {{variation in}} management {{of patients with}} a vaginal pessary for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Methods: A nationwide survey was sent to all Dutch gynecologists with {{a special interest in}} urogynecology. Results: The response rate was 59 %. Of the respondents, 13 % had a written protocol for pessary treatment in their department. Pessary treatment was proposed by 69 % of respondents as a treatment option. Counseling about side effects varied. All respondents provided information concerning the possibility of serious vaginal discharge. Concerning this side effect, 15 % of the respondents stated that it occurs in 5 – 20 % of patients, 27 % that it occurs in 20 – 40 % of patients, and 57 % that it occurs in more than 40 % of patients. Another <b>item</b> <b>concerned</b> counseling for the likelihood of vaginal blood loss. All respondents provided information concerning the possibility of vaginal blood loss. Concerning this side effect, 53 % of the respondents stated that it occurs in 5 – 20 % of patients, 33 % that it occurs in 20 – 40 %, and 14 % that it occurs in more than 40 % of patients. Follow-up after initial placement was done by 69 % of the respondents at 2 – 6 weeks, by 2 % at 8 weeks, and by 29 % at 12 weeks or more. Most (98 %) of the respondents extended the interval between visits when the patient had no complaints, and 96 % of the respondents reported that they routinely instruct patients about self-management. Conclusions: Pessaries are suggested as a treatment option by a majority of gynecologists, but practice varies widely. We consider that the variation in practice is {{due to a lack of}} available protocols and lack of evidence...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of {{modelling}} condition monitoring intervals. The model is formulated based upon two important concepts. One is the failure delay time concept, {{which is used to}} divide the failure process of the item into two periods, namely a normal working period followed by a failure delay time period from a defect being first identified to the actual failure. The other is the conditional residual time concept, which assumes that the residual time also depends on the history condition information obtained. Stochastic filtering theory is used to predict the residual time distribution given all monitored information obtained to date over the failure delay time period. The solution procedure is carried out in two stages. We first propose a static model that is used to determine a fixed condition monitoring interval over the item life. Once the monitored information indicates a possible abnormality of the <b>item</b> <b>concerned,</b> that is the start of the failure delay time, a dynamic approach is employed to determine the next monitoring time at the current monitoring point given that the item is not scheduled for a preventive replacement before that time. This implies that the dynamic model overrides the static model over the failure delay time since more frequent monitoring might be needed to keep the item in close attention before an appropriate replacement is made prior to failure. Two key problems are addressed in the paper. The first is which criterion function we should use in determining the monitoring check interval, and the second is the optimization process for both models, which can be solved neither analytically nor numerically since they depend on two unknown quantities, namely, the available condition information and a decision of the time to replace the item over the failure delay time. For the first problem, we propose five appealingly good criterion functions, and test them using simulations to see which one performs best. The second problem was solved using a hybrid of simulation and analytical solution procedures. We finally present a numerical example to demonstrate the modelling methodology...|$|E
