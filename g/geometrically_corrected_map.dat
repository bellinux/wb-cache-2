40|$|M-DAS is {{a ground}} data {{processing}} system designed for analysis of multispectral data. M-DAS operates on multispectral data from LANDSAT, S- 192, M 2 S and other sources in CCT form. Interactive training by operator-investigators using a variable cursor on a color display was used to derive optimum processing coefficients and data on cluster separability. An advanced multivariate normal-maximum likelihood processing algorithm was used to produce output in various formats: color-coded film images, <b>geometrically</b> <b>corrected</b> <b>map</b> overlays, moving displays of scene sections, coverage tabulations and categorized CCTs. The analysis procedure for M-DAS involves three phases: (1) screening and training, (2) analysis of training data to compute performance predictions and processing coefficients, and (3) processing of multichannel input data into categorized results. Typical M-DAS applications involve iteration between each of these phases. A series of photographs of the M-DAS display are used to illustrate M-DAS operation...|$|E

This investigation presents a projection-based AR system that supports deformable substrates that can be bent, twisted or folded. We demonstrate a new invisible marker embedded into a deformable substrate and an algorithm that identifies deformations to project <b>geometrically</b> <b>correct</b> textures onto the deformable object. The <b>geometrically</b> <b>correct</b> projection-based texture <b>mapping</b> onto a deformable marker is conducted using the measurement of the 3 D shape through the detec-tion of the retro-reflective marker on the surface. In order to achieve accurate texture mapping, we propose a marker pattern that can be partially recognized and can be registered to an object’s surface. The outcome of this work addresses a fundamental vision recog-nition challenge that allows the underlying material to change shape and be recognized by the system.

40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} are: (1) {{producing}} a <b>geometrically</b> <b>corrected</b> physiographic-soil <b>map</b> scale 1 : 50, 000 reduced to the attached map; (2) detecting some soil characteristics as (effective soil depth, salinity and alkalinity) of the investigated area during the last 28 years to produce the soil resilience maps. To fulfill the first aim, eight soil profiles were selected from 30 profiles to represent the different mapping units. Morphological description was carried out and soil samples were collected for physical and chemical analyses. Based on ETM+ images and the geographic information system, coupled with the field work and laboratory analysis data, the physiographic-soil map was produced. The following main landscape units can be identified: (1) coastal plain (the fluvio-marine deposits) and (2) young sub-deltaic deposits. With respect to the second aim except some environmental processes which occur without human interference, the soil resilience resulted when soils are used and managed in the right way. Land use and management have a direct effect on soil resilience. It can decrease soil degradation and increase soil restoration and accordingly increase soil resilience. The main types of human activities included soil resilience in the investigated area are soil resilience against salinization, soil resilience against alkalinization and soil resilience against water logging. The human action on soil resilience could be recognized through the man-action as good and proper land management, introducing proper land modern irrigation and drainage styles, in addition to adequate fertilizing programs...|$|R

As illustrated by the papers in this special feature, {{and a growing number of}} papers in ecology, environmental management and remote sensing journals (Butler, 2006; Mumby et aL, 2001; Zanoni and Goward, 2003), there is an increasing need for spatial information derived from multi-spectral sensors at the scales of traditional aerial photography.

No difference was found for liquid food. Liquids redistributed much faster than solids within the stomach. Measurement of GER using a single-phase liquid meal does not require geometrical correction.

Field data was collected in 1985, 1988 and 1989 in Niger and an appropriate sampling scheme for the study area was developed. Herbaceous vegetation could be estimated to within t 150 kgha 1 at an 80 % confidence level up to 1300 kgha - 1. Establishing site positions {{was found to be}} a primary obstacle when selecting suitable sampling areas. Suggested is the use of Landsat MSS image hard-copies in combination with a global positioning system. Landsat MSS and NOAA AVHRR LAC data were available for dates corresponding to field surveys of 1985 and 1988. While Landsat MSS scenes were <b>geometrically</b> <b>corrected</b> to <b>maps,</b> NOAA AVHRR images were registered to Landsat MSS with a simulated resolution of 1. 1 km. Data from both satellites were radiometrically corrected and standardized to atmospheric conditions to the image with the highest relative scene contrast for each study area. These reference images were identified on the basis of bare soil spectral reflectance values and a binary decision tree. Five methods of resampling image data to represent field sites were applied. - The image data sampling methods were found to have a significant influence on spectral reflectance values attributed to a site and, consequently, on the relationship between ground and satellite VIs. Ratio, normalized difference and perpendicular VIs (RVI, NDVI and PVI) were computed for each step of pre-processing procedures. For Landsat MSS VIs were also derived from average spectral reflectance values of bands 3 and 4 to simulate NOAA AVHRR channel 2. VIs were compared for the same sensor, between sensors and related to field data by using linear and logarithmic regression analyses. RVIs and NDVIs achieved very similar results, while PVIs showed a more variable relationship to ground data. Overall, VIs from simulated NOAA AVHRR channel 2 values were found to be not superior to those derived from just band 4. NOAA AVHRR VIs could be related to Landsat MSS ratio VIs by a single regression line for 1985 and 1988 growing seasons for Niger and Mali survey sites. For the inter-calibration a simulation of the NOAA AVHRR pixel size was found to be better suited than the high resolution Landsat MSS data...|$|R

The necessary image transformations are derived by finding a mapping between a capture and display device for a fixed viewer location.

40|$|Abstract. In medical imaging, signals {{acquired}} in non-Cartesian coordinate systems are common. For instance, CT and MRI often produce significantly higher resolution within scan planes, {{compared to the}} distance between two adjacent planes. Even oblique sampling occurs, {{by the use of}} gantry tilt. In ultrasound imaging, samples are {{acquired in}} a polar coordinate system, which implies a spatially varying metric. In order to produce a <b>geometrically</b> <b>correct</b> image, signals are generally resampled to a Cartesian coordinate system. This paper concerns estimation of local structure tensors directly from the non-Cartesian coordinate system, thus avoiding deteriorated signal and noise characteristics caused by resampling. In many cases processing directly in the warped coordinate system is also less time-consuming. A <b>geometrically</b> <b>correct</b> tensor must obey certain transformation rules originating from fundamental differential geometry. Subsequently, this fact also affects the tensor estimation. As the local structure tensor is estimated using filters, a change of coordinate system also change the shape of the spatial support of these filters. Implications and limitations brought on by sampling require the filter design criteria to be adapted to the coordinate system. ...|$|R
