40|$|An {{explanation}} for the magnetic properties of Martian surface material is discussed, specifically that the surface particles were composed primarily of smectite clay (nontronite) pigmented throughout by a red magnetic phase. The thermal treatment of nontronite in air, for long periods at 700 deg C or short periods at 900 deg C, results in destruction of the nontronite structure, a distinct reddening in color, and a spectacular increase in magnetic susceptibility and saturation magnetization (up to 4. 4 Am squared/kg). Magnetic property measurements suggest that the magnetism {{is due to the}} presence of ultrafine particles of alpha or gamma Fe 2 O 3; the precise identify was not resolved. Thermally treated nontronite has chemical, color and magnetic properties akin to those found by Viking on Mars. These results favor an origin for the fine <b>grained</b> Martian <b>surface</b> material by repeated impacts into an Fe-rich smectite-charged regolith, the smectite having resulted from hydrothermal alteration of volcanic or impact generated glass, the magnetic phase having resulted from the pressure or thermal shocked nontronite...|$|R

40|$|It {{is found}} that the thermal {{treatment}} of nontronite in air, for long periods at 700 C or short periods at 900 C, results {{in the destruction of}} the nontronite structure, a distinct reddening in color, and a large increase in magnetic susceptibility and saturation magnetization. Measurements and calculations of the magnetic properties suggest that the magnetism is due to the presence of ultrafine particles of alpha or gamma Fe 2 O 3. The highly magnetic thermally treated nontronite is amorphous to X-rays consistent with an ultrafine grain size. Prolonged heating results in the growth of alpha Fe 2 O 3, while reflectivity spectra of a sample heated for 1 hr at 900 C indicate the presence of an opaque, magnetite-like phase in addition to alpha Fe 2 O 3.

INTRODUCTION Alloy electrodeposition technologies can extend tremendously the potential of electrochemical deposition processes to provide coatings that require unique mechanical, chemical and physical properties [1]. There {{has been a great}} research interest in the development and characterization of iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) thin films due to their operational capacity, economic interest, magnetic and other properties [2]. Due to their unique low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and soft magnetic properties, Fe-Ni alloys have been used in industrial applications for over 100 years [3]. Typical examples of applications that are based on the low CTE of Fe-Ni alloys include: thermostatic bimetals, glass sealing, integrated circuit packaging, cathode ray tube, shadow masks, membranes for liquid natural gas tankers; applications based on the soft magnetic properties include: read-write heads for magnetic storage, magnetic actuators, magnetic shielding, high performance transformer cores. comprise the simple baths whereas complex baths were prepared by adding ascorbic acid, saccharin and citric acid in simple baths. The effect of bath composition, pH and applied current density on coating appearance, composition, morphology and magnetic property were studied. Wet chemical analysis technique was used to analyze the coating composition whereas SEM and VSM were used to study the deposit morphology and magnetic property respectively. Addition of complexing agents in plating baths suppressed the anomalous nature of Fe-Ni alloy electrodeposition. Coatings obtained from simple baths were characterized by coarse <b>grained</b> non-smooth <b>surface</b> with/without microcracks onto it whereas those from complex baths were fine <b>grained</b> with smooth <b>surfaces.</b> Satisfactory saturation magnetization value of 131. 13 emu/g in coating was obtained from simple bath.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{shot peening}} (USSP) is an {{effective}} method for surface modification of metallic materials. It can modify the surface topography of the target surface, introduce compressive stress into the components, and produce gradient nanograined structures in the peened materials. This dissertation concentrates on the technical developments of ultrasonic shot peening, {{the ability of the}} ultrasonic shot peening for the gradient nanograined surface fabrication and the mechanical behavior and biological applications of the developed gradient nanograined surfaces. Dynamic behavior of the shot during ultrasonic shot peening was investigated experimentally and numerically. A physical model describing the motion behavior of the shot during ultrasonic shot peening was established and verified. To better control the topography of the peened surface, a finite element simulation model simulating the strain distribution of the peened surface and a numerical algorithm to predict the surface topography during ultrasonic shot peening process were developed. Gradient nanograined surfaces were successfully fabricated on low carbon steel, pure copper, and 316 L stainless steel materials. Mechanical testing indicated significant improvement of the nanohardness of the gradient nanograined surface fabricated on the pure copper and 316 L stainless steel samples. In addition, an in-situ method to produce nanograined metallic flakes/powders was discovered in the presence of fractures of the nanograined materials. The findings indicate that ultrasonic shot peening can be used as an effective tool for mass production of nanograined metallic flakes/powders. The formation mechanism of the nanograined metallic flakes includes surface nanostructuring and fatigue failure of the gradient nanograined surface. ^ Requirements of the next generation biomaterials include long-term durability and fast osseointegration. Metallic materials have been widely used in orthopedic applications. Due to the strength-ductility synergy and increased surface hydrophilicity, the gradient nanograined structure fabricated by ultrasonic shot peening provides an effective and potential mass-production method to enhance the mechanical and biological performance of the bioimplant materials. In this dissertation, “net-like” ultrafine-grained (~ 200 nm) surfaces and nanograined (below 100 nm) surfaces were successfully fabricated on 316 L stainless steel via ultrasonic shot peening. Human osteoblast cell (SaoS- 2) was cultured on these ultrafine grained/nanograined surfaces and on coarse <b>grained</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Research results showed that the “net-like” ultrafine-grained and nanograined surface can promote the attachment, spreading, and proliferation of human osteoblast. Human osteoblast cell’s biological functions can be modulated by changing the grain boundary density of the ultrafine grained/nanograined surface. In addition, aggregated protein particles were observed on the nanograined cell-substrate interface, affirming that nanograined surfaces can promote protein adsorption. To further strengthen the assertion that nanograined cell-substrate interface can be used to promote human osteoblast cell functions, long-term “in-vivo” investigations are proposed for future study. ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1997 and 1999 three field {{surveys in}} the Volga River {{and in its}} three most {{important}} tributaries: Kama, Oka and Sura were carried out to investigate the distribution of inorganic and organic pollutants in the river sediments. The investigations were planned {{as a part of}} a 'Pre-Phase' of a larger Russian-German 'Volga-Rhein-Project' to follow the previous 'Oka-Elbe-Project'. Within the frame of this research project sediments in the middle and lower course of the Volga river between the Gorki, Cheboksary, Kujbyshev, Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs and in three tributaries of the Volga river: Kama, Oka and Sura were investigated. Since fine <b>grained</b> <b>surface</b> sediments reflect the general condition of a water body with respect to heavy metals, major groups of organic pollutants and nutrients, the results of their investigation can be used for describing the present contamination or eutrophic status of a river, lake or marginal sea, as well as the situation in their catchment areas. Dated sediments from sediment cores with a continuous sequence of sediment layers contain the information of the environmental situation at the time of their deposition and are therefore witnesses of the historical development of contamination.

40|$|Product {{miniaturization}} is an {{ever increasing}} customer demand in aerospace, bio-medical, defense and electronics industries. These microparts {{play a vital}} role and are required to abide by stringent norms set forth by various quality control agencies. To maintain their functionality over a period of time, they are made of special engineering materials rather than silicon as commonly used in microelectronics. Lithography, etching, embossing, electroplating, laser machining and other micro manufacturing techniques have been employed traditionally to manufacture microcomponents; however, these techniques would be expensive, cause surface damage, or produce a very rough surface. Electrochemical polishing is capable of machining/polishing any conducting material while holding close dimensional tolerances. This research develops a high frequency electrochemical nanopolishing technique for commercially pure alpha titanium. An alcohol and salt based electrolyte was used with direct current as well as alternating current on alpha titanium plate. For both current types, optimal surface roughness R_(a) ~ 300 nm was obtained on poly <b>grained</b> <b>surface</b> using interferometry and ~ 2 nm within a single grain by atomic force microscopy. Comparable results were obtained by other researchers with 30 - 120 nm R_(a) for titanium and titanium alloys. Linear regression models were developed to predict the surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract. Surface grain {{refinement}} {{is a relatively}} new process aimed to enhance mechanical material properties. In this study Al 7075 -T 6 bars have been shot peened with parameters much different from those of conventional shot peening. Microstructure gradient has been observed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nano indentation tester. A fine grained layer was found on top surface of the specimens. Measurements indicate of notable improvements in cases of hardness and elastic modulus in comparison with untreated material. XRD results also show significant depth affected both in terms of residual stress and FWHM.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming cutting {{technologies}} {{are the most important}} procedures, because every single component has to be cut minimum once. Increasing standards in terms of safety and crash performance in the automotive industries leads to material toughness as well as more complex part geometries. Most of these parts are made by press-hardening. As a pre-process a new and innovative contact heating devise were developed. To post-process this ultra high strength steels (UHSS) common shear cutting technologies, like shearing or fine blanking, are not suitable any more. Production processes by laser trimming are still state of the art in this field of industries. But this is suboptimal in terms of time-, material- and energy-efficiency. Substitution of these laser procedures by economical cutting technologies is essential more than ever. The innovative High Speed Impact Cutting (HSIC), with cutting velocities up to 10 m/s, could be an alternative to process these UHSS. Advantages of the HSIC are the fine <b>grained</b> cutting <b>surface,</b> which can be directly used as a function surface and the oil free cut. Detailed pre-investigations to process UHSS by HSIC were made. It is shown how process parameters like die clearance, cutting velocity, suitable tool materials and design are determined. Based on this knowledge, the applicability of HSIC of directly, inline press-hardened materials is shown {{with the help of a}} crash relevant serial component of a car B-pillar. Next to an improved cutting quality, a significant shortened process time were indicated by using the new HSIC technology and machinery (laser process time: 1 : 20 min vs: HSIC process time: 20 ms) [1]. It is scientifically shown how it is possible to reach a significant increase in productivity by developing and using innovative contact heating and cutting technologies. This leads to huge saving effects in terms of energy, time as well as material...|$|R

The experiments {{were divided into two}} parts. The first part concerned with the photoelectric characteristics of the various surfaces, and the second part was involved with image quality relative to photoelectric properties of different substrates. The characteristics of each of the surfaces was briefly discussed. Photoelectric properties such as 1) photosensitivity, 2) spectral response, 3) surface acceptance potential, 4) dark decay, 5) light decay, 6) retentivity, and 7) residual potential of the various surfaces of the aluminum substrates were reported. Image quality of a variety of plates in terms of 1) resolution of halftones and line patterns, 2) edge sharpness, 3) solid fill-in, 4) image density, and 5) cleanliness of non-image area were analyzed. The relationship of photoelectric properties vs. image quality of these surfaces was reported.
