40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of emergent response of major <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> accident on the highway, the emergency response system of major <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> accident on highway based on the GIS is researched and developed. Due to the characteristic of the emergent response of major <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> accident on the highway, the system develops and designs four subsystems and six basic databases. By combing Gaussian model, GIS new technology and modern safety management method, the system realizes three major functions urgently needed by emergent response, which are quick function for dangerous substance and hazard installations, predictive function for disaster and accident consequence, accessibility for emergency response decision. The system would provide technical support for the emergent response of major <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> accident on the highway...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is: "Leaks of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> {{substances}} {{in the territory}} of the town Pilsen". I have been dealing with this very hot issue, because {{there are more and more}} chemical substances around us. We can find a lot of companies producing, using and having these substances in stock, so we cannot rule out smaller or larger leaks. They usually have negative impacts on human health and life, animals, environment or the leak can cause high material damage. It is necessary to take new measures to decrease results of leak of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substances. In the theoretical part of my work I described some <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substances, rules for behaviour and arrangments during the leaks of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substances. In the practical part I evaluated statistic records about leaks of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substances and I valuated talks with experts of public administration in the area of Pilsen town. I carried out my own modulation of ammonia leak in the programme,,TerEx? and by that I gained an area of public danger where I performed an investigation among people. In my work there was verified a hypothesis whether the people living round the object with <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substances have some knowledge about the individual protection. I came to conclusion that this hypothesi can be confirmated due to out comes of my questionary research ? our inhabitants are endowed with the needy useful knowledge (as I have been persuaded by). In my work I found out and important piece of knowledge that there had been only one leak of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> substance some ammonia leak from the Pilsner ´´PRAZDROJ a. s. ´´. It was an acceptional situation and it did not have any serious effect on people and environment. I would like to recommend only one thing ? to increase public awareness about possible danger in the place of domicile. It is necessary to say that people are only exceptionally interested in these safety questions. This work can be used within the public administration in the field of emergency management and accidental planning for (preparation of) inhabitants´ protection. It can also be used as some study material...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals</b> regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals</b> into the environment with little prior investigation of their environment and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use {{was a threat to}} wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease vector control continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.|$|E

Finally, this paper defines area operations, qualifications requirements of rescuers in area, principles of division, protective objects for different areas, so as to determine the personal protection level of emergency rescuers in various areas, which can provide reference for the personal protection of emergency rescuers in <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> accidents...|$|R

There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers. Authorities such as regulatory agencies set occupational exposure limits {{to mitigate the}} risk of chemical hazards. [...] An international effort is investigating {{the health effects of}} mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals. This may be particularly important in causing cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, wooden {{railroad}} ties {{have also}} become popular for gardening and landscaping, both in creating retaining walls and raised-bed gardens, and sometimes for building steps as well. Traditionally, the ties sold {{for this purpose}} are decommissioned ties taken from rail lines when replaced with new ties, and their lifespan is often limited due to rot. Some entrepreneurs sell new ties. Due {{to the presence of}} wood preservatives such as coal tar, creosote or salts of heavy metals, railroad ties introduce an extra element of soil pollution into gardens and are avoided by many property owners. [...] In the UK, new oak beams of the same size as standard railroad ties, but not treated with <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals,</b> are now available specifically for garden construction. They are about twice the price of the recycled product. In some places, railroad ties have been used in the construction of homes, particularly among those with lower incomes, especially near railroad tracks, including railroad employees. They are also used as cribbing for docks and boathouses.|$|E
2500|$|In aquatic sediments, {{a number}} of {{reactions}} can transform the chemicals released by the creosote preservatives into more <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Most creosote preservative compounds have hazards associated with them before they are transformed. Cresol (m-, p-, and o-), phenol, guaiacol, and xylenol (1,3,4- and 1,3,5-) all are acute aquatic hazards prior to going through chemical reactions with the sediments. Alkylation reactions allows for the compounds to transition into more toxic compounds {{with the addition of}} R-groups to the major compounds found in creosote preservatives. Compounds formed through alkylation include: 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, which are all listed as acute environmental hazards. [...] Biodegradation controls {{the rate at which the}} sediment holds the chemicals, and the amount of reactions that are able to take place. The biodegradation process can take place under many different conditions, and vary depending on the compounds that are released. Oxidation-reduction reactions allow for the compounds to be broken down into new forms of more toxic molecules. Studies have shown oxidation-reduction reactions of creosote preservative compounds included compounds that are listed as environmental hazards, such as p-benzoquinone in the oxidation of phenol. Not only are the initial compounds in creosote hazardous to the environment, but the byproducts of the chemical reactions are environmental hazardous as well.|$|E

6000|$|To be frank, {{upon that}} common ground of decent behaviour, pride and self-respect, {{health and the}} heroic habit of thinking, we need for {{ourselves}} not so much rules as wisdom, and for others not, indeed, a foolish and indiscriminate toleration but at least patience, arrests of judgment, and the honest endeavour to understand. Now to help the imagination in these judgments, to enlarge and interpret experience, is most {{certainly one of the}} functions of literature. A good biography may give facts of infinite suggestion, and the great multitude of novels at present are, in fact, experiments in the science of this central field of human action, experiments in the [...] "way of looking at" [...] various cases and situations. They may be very misleading experiments, it is true, done with adulterated substances, <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals,</b> dirty flasks and unsound balances; but that is a question of their quality and not of their nature, they are experiments for all that. A good novel may become a very potent and convincing experiment indeed. Books in these matters are often so much quieter and cooler as counsellors than friends. And there, in truth, is my whole mind in this matter.|$|E
