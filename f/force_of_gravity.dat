5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale.

5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E

Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour.

The challenge for our bodies {{is to maintain}} stability and move efficiently against the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> Disease, injury, environment, emotions, body type, kinesthetic sense and repetitive activities can lead to adverse movement patterns and further dysfunction. Identifying abnormal movement patterns and understanding the interplay between gravity, buoyancy and our bodies {{is essential for the}} aquatic therapist. Ideal alignment especially the curves of the spine are important in withstanding the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> For a weight bearing joint to be stable the gravity line must fall through the joint’s axis of rotation. For example: in standing the gravity line should fall just anterior to the knee and posterior to the patella this allows the knee to remain straight and the person upright without excessive forces at the joint or excessive effort from the quadriceps. If the gravity line falls anterior to the patella the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> tend to push the knee into hyperextension causing increased stress to the soft tissue of the posterior knee. This position causes the ACL to be on slack and over time leads to weakness of the ligament and possibly increasing risk of ACL injury in young women who tend to have this alignment.

However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b>|$|E

Measurements of spinal, pelvic, and hip flexibility led to gradations from normal (full correction) to a series of intermediate values indicating partial correction of deformity with some flexibility to being unchanged from the deformity group (severe rigidity). Flexibility and rigidity thus occur at opposite ends of the same spectrum.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> is an inverse-square law.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
50|$|Infiltration is {{the process}} by which water on the ground surface enters the soil. The water enters the soil through the pores by the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and {{capillary}} action. The largest cracks and pores offer a great reservoir for the initial flush of water. This allows a rapid infiltration. The smaller pores take longer to fill and rely on capillary forces as well as gravity. The smaller pores have a slower infiltration as the soil becomes more saturated.|$|R
50|$|The {{primordial}} plasma {{would have}} had very slight overdensities of matter, thought to have derived from the enlargement of quantum fluctuations during inflation. Whatever the source, these overdensities gravitationally attract matter. But the intense heat of the near constant photon-matter interactions of this epoch rather forcefully seeks thermal equilibrium, which creates {{a large amount of}} outward pressure. These counteracting <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and pressure create oscillations, analogous to sound waves created in air by pressure differences.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{of solar}} and {{planetary}} orbits, rotations, and diameters show that these attributes are related by simple ratios. The <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and magnetism and {{the principles of}} energy conservation, entropy, power laws, and the log-normal distribution which are evident are discussed in relation to planetary distribution with respect to time in the solar system. This discussion is informed by consideration of the periodicities of interactions, {{as well as the}} regularity and periodicity of fluctuations in proxy records which indicate solar variation. It is demonstrated that a simple model based on planetary interaction frequencies can well replicate the timing and general shape of solar variation over the period of the sunspot record. Finally, an explanation is offered for the high degree of stable organisation and correlation with cyclic solar variability observed in the solar system. The interaction <b>of</b> the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and magnetism along with the thermodynamic principles acting on planets may be analogous to those generating the internal dynamics of the Sun. This possibility could help account for the existence of strong correlations between orbital dynamics and solar variation for which a sufficiently powerful physical mechanism has yet to be fully demonstrated...|$|R
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E

Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation.

Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates.

As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate.
