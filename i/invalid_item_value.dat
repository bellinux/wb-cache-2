40|$|The {{standard}} procedure for lot-by-lot acceptance/rejection sampling described in literature makes always a decision. If {{there are more}} <b>invalid</b> <b>items</b> in the sample than specified, then the lot is rejected, otherwise the lot is accepted. However, if the actual proportion of <b>invalid</b> <b>items</b> in the lot {{is close to the}} accepted quality level then it is - in principle - impossible to control the customer's and the producer's risk with a reasonable sample size. The published {{standard procedure}} can result in acceptance of the lot even if there is insufficient information. We think this is unfair to the customer. Three statistical methods with a common acceptable quality limit are proposed and discussed: A simple procedure, confidence intervals, and finally a statistical test. The idea of a statistical test, its application in lot-by-lot acceptance/rejection sampling, and the proposed statistical test are described in detail and with examples. Additionally, determination of sample size and multiple step sampling plans are characterized...|$|R

The tables may be precalculated and stored in static program storage, calculated (or [...] "pre-fetched") {{as part of a}} program's initialization phase (memoization), or even stored in hardware in application-specific platforms. Lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or <b>invalid)</b> <b>items</b> in an array and, in some programming languages, may include pointer functions (or offsets to labels) to process the matching input. FPGAs also make extensive use of reconfigurable, hardware-implemented, lookup tables to provide programmable hardware functionality.|$|R

40|$|Summary. This paper {{introduces}} the paired comparison model as a suitable approach {{for the analysis}} of partially ranked data. For example, the Inglehart index, collected in international social surveys to examine shifts in post-materialistic values, generates such data on a set of attitude items. However, current analysis methods have failed to account for the complex shifts in individual <b>item</b> <b>values,</b> or to incorporate subject covariates. The paired comparison model is thus developed to allow for covariate subject effects at the individual level, and a reparameterization allows the inclusion of smooth non-linear effects of continuous covariates. The Inglehart index collected in the 1993 International Social Science Programme survey is analysed, and complex non-linear changes of <b>item</b> <b>values</b> with age, level of education and religion are identified.

50|$|The prices fences pay thieves {{typically}} depend both on {{norms and}} on legitimate market {{rates for the}} items in question. Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an <b>item's</b> <b>value.</b> Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an <b>item's</b> <b>value</b> in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items. At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them {{about the value of}} an individual item and the relevant market conditions. For example, a fence may falsely tell a small-time thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.|$|R

5000|$|Alien Abduction [...] - [...] The {{scene is}} in front of the White House. A large saucer is {{hovering}} overhead, with smaller saucers appearing to the sides. Various objects (sportscars, cows, etc.) appear at the sides as well, and the smaller UFOs attempt to use their tractor beams to steal these objects (these objects can be cycled through by using the Action buttons). The scoring is based on saving the item being beamed up and goes up to 3 million. Regardless of where an <b>item's</b> <b>value</b> starts, it counts down fairly rapidly (i.e. a hurry-up) once the Martians start abducting it. Shooting the Martian to save the item immediately awards the current <b>item's</b> <b>value,</b> and adds the <b>item</b> <b>value</b> to the mode [...] "jackpot" [...] (which starts at 1M). Once all items have been rescued and the center ramp lights, the mode jackpot will start counting down as a hurry-up until you shoot the ramp to collect. Hitting the center targets, ramps and loops will destroy the smaller UFOs, as will the missiles. After seven of the smaller saucers are destroyed, one final hit up the middle Mini ramp will destroy the large saucer, ending the mode. Destroying all seven saucers will award a Flawless rating and a Saucer light. The whole mode features various audio samples made by a Bill Clinton impersonator.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the following sequential decision problem. Given a set of items of unknown utility, we need to select one of as high a utility as possible (``the selection problem''). Measurements (possibly noisy) of <b>item</b> <b>values</b> prior to selection are allowed, at a known cost. The goal is to optimize the overall sequential decision process of measurements and selection. Value of information (VOI) is a well-known scheme for selecting measurements, but the intractability of the problem typically leads to using myopic VOI estimates. In the selection problem, myopic VOI frequently badly underestimates the value of information, leading to inferior sensing plans. We relax the strict myopic assumption into a scheme we term semi-myopic, providing a spectrum of methods that can improve the performance of sensing plans. In particular, we propose the efficiently computable method of ``blinkered'' VOI, and examine theoretical bounds for special cases. Empirical evaluation of ``blinkered'' VOI in the selection problem with normally distributed <b>item</b> <b>values</b> shows that is performs much better than pure myopic VOI.
