500|$|WALL•E {{proves to}} this {{generation}} {{and beyond that}} the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination.

Not since Chaplin's [...] "Little Tramp" [...] has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words.

500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board.

[...] Peters made her solo concert debut at Lincoln Center in New York City in 2006. Holden, reviewing this concert, noted, [...] "Even while swiveling across the stage of Avery Fisher Hall like a voluptuous Botticelli Venus in Bob Mackie spangles... she radiated a preternatural innocence.... For the eternal child <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> she evokes a surrogate childhood playmate". Peters was the headliner at the 2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival in Adelaide, Australia.

Greg Wise was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie François, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, {{was one of the}} last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, [...] "Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> just by being there."

500|$|The Los Angeles Times Susan Carpenter {{reviewed}} the graphic novel and {{described it as}} [...] "a well-paced story that feels dynamic and also intimate."

[...] Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. [...] Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it [...] "really sweet, really funny and really scary, [...] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human." [...] Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a [...] "funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner" [...] and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel [...] "a masterpiece". [...] Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art [...] " [...] little uneven, but... at its best when the lights go out."
