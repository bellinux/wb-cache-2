40|$|M. Cur. From {{experience}} and observation of decision-making <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> {{it has been}} observed that nurses <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> make clinical decisions, which they can justified, and other decisions which they cannot justified. The last type of clinical decisions are sometimes referred to as gut-feelings or intuition by nurses <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> It seem further from the observation in respect to clinical decision-making, that clinical decision-making based on intuition are effective, and contribute to better and more complete problemsolving <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> From the afore-mentioned problemstatement the following two questions were asked in this study, namely: * What is intuition? * What is the role of intuition in clinical decision-making by the nurse <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units?</b> The objectives of the study is, namely in phase one of the study to analyse the concept intuition, and in phase two to explore and describe the role if intuition in clinical decision-making by the nurse <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> a Philosophical analytical research design were implemented in order to reach these two objectives. The concept intuition was analyse by the method of concept-analysis in order to describe the characteristics of intuition, and to describe a theoretical definition for the study with regards to these characteristics. In order to answer the second objective, a literature study on decisionmaking was undertake.
