5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria <b>is</b> <b>either</b> heterotrophic, where {{organic carbon}} compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria <b>is</b> <b>either</b> based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E

A committee consisting of the Joint Secretary and the Director/Deputy Secretary of Department of Sports, the Secretary and the Executive Director/Director (TEAMS) of SAI verify and validate the nominations.|$|E

They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that <b>is</b> <b>either</b> {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground.

5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation <b>is</b> <b>either</b> bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the only {{significant}} one being a specimen that <b>is</b> <b>either</b> Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae.

5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania.

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year <b>is</b> <b>either</b> a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition <b>is</b> <b>either</b> true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
