A substantial level of O 2 (> 15 %) was present in packs resulting in a shorter than expected shelf-life, where the primary spoilage mechanism {{was found to be}} mould. Various combinations of vacuum (0 – 0. 6 MPa) and <b>gas</b> <b>flush</b> (0. 02 – 0. 03 MPa) (30 % CO 2 / 70 % N 2) settings were assessed as treatments that result in the desired shelf-life (28 days).

The design of a coaxial, high repetition rate, large average power, and long lifetime spark-gap switch is discussed. The switch is used with a fail-free LCR trigger circuit. Critical issues for switch design are presented together with experimental results. It is observed that the switch has a good stability, and its lifetime {{is estimated to be}} in the order of 1010 shots (~ 106 C) at 10 J/pulse, 60 kV and 100 ns pulses. Measurements were performed with 20 and 34 kV average switching voltage (100 ns pulses, energy per pulse 0. 4 and 0. 75 J, respectively). For up to 450 pulses/s (pps), pre-firing can be prevented by increasing the gap pressure (up to 2. 5 and 7 bars, respectively), no <b>gas</b> <b>flush</b> is required. Above 450 pps, up to 820 pps, a forced gas flow of maximal 35 Nm 3 /h, is required for stable operation.

40|$|Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) {{relies on}} {{modification}} of the atmosphere inside the package in order to extend food shelf life by reducing oxidation and microbial degradation rate. In the peculiar case of inert products (e. g. meat- or fish-based food products) MAP is achieved by the interplay of two processes: (1) the transfer of gases through the packaging and (2) either the gas depletion (gain) process (<b>gas</b> <b>flush</b> or absorber). To preserve {{the quality of a}} food, MAP maintains duration of a given O 2 /CO 2 mixture by using high barrier packaging materials. Currently, to evaluate the impact of gases on microorganisms growth, the “pack and pray” empirical methodology is used: different gases mixtures (mainly O 2 /CO 2 /N 2) are successively tested on the product until the right combination (O 2 /CO 2 ratio, package surface/volume, mass of food, etc.) is found. The use of mass transfer models concomitantly with predictive microbiology would be a more appropriate method to allow a correct design and sizing of modified atmosphere packaging systems by minimizing the number of experiments. However, this kind of tool combining mass transfer and predictive microbiology does not yet exist. Gases transfer phenomena in solid food matrix are characterised with two parameters, a thermodynamic one (solubility), and a kinetic one (diffusivity), both indispensible in mathematical models of mass transfer. The main bottleneck in the evaluation of O 2 solubility and diffusivity is the quantification of dissolved oxygen in solid food matrix. This work that takes place {{in the context of the}} MAP’OPT project, funded by the French National Research Agency, aims at developing innovative, rapid and non-destructive methodologies to determine O 2 solubility and diffusivity in liquid and solid food matrices.

Total psychrotrophic counts obtained from the top and bottom surfaces did not differ significantly for most sampling periods. Similar growth patterns were observed on both steak surfaces, increasing (P <. 05) primarily between Day 3 and Day 9 of post-treatment storage. The steaks packaged within the gas atmospheres had lower (P<. 05) total growth than the control steaks. Comparing atmospheres, the steaks packaged in relatively low CO₂ and O₂ levels (10 % and 5 %, respectively) had lower (P<. 05) microbial growth than steaks packaged in 15 to 60 % CO₂ and 40 % O₂ when initial contamination was low. Pseudomonas dominated the microflora on the steak surfaces in all packaging treatments during early storage. Other aerobic organisms which survived gas atmosphere treatments include Coryneforms, Micrococcus, and Microbacterium, although they did not show large increases in growth. Coryneforms were also competitive on the bottom surface of the control steaks despite domination by the pseudomonad organisms. Loose packaging in impermeable barrier bags allowed the growth of Serratia liquifaciens after 6 days of storage. This bacterium also tended to dominate the flora within the gas atmosphere packages, although other facultative organisms (Enterobacter aerogenes and Yersenia enterocolitica) were also identified.

40|$|The ongoing {{developments}} in the combustion engine technology demand the reduction of piston weight and the simultaneous increase in the specific strength of the cast metal structure. The reduction of the oxygen concentration in the casting mold atmosphere has a theoretical potential to allow the realization of thin-walled castings and a parallel reduction of defect density, which are both cornerstones of the ongoing developments. In this study it was investigated {{to what extent the}} oxidation of aluminum melt can be suppressed via inert <b>gas</b> <b>flush</b> of the mold and how this practice affects the mold filling procedure. Furthermore it was investigated how the positive effects of the inert gas casting could be fortified by the introduction of novel completive measures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the inert gas flooding of the mold cavity, firstly the casting properties of the used aluminum piston alloy were determined under air and technical shielding gas atmospheres. The results indicate that the obtained reduction of the oxidation rate does enhance the fluidity, however the improvements seem to be concentrated to the liquid flow state. After the conditions have been clarified, the practical work began with the design and validation of the for inert gas casting dedicated gating system. The preset criteria were fulfilled after six development stages, wherewith the conditions {{for the start of the}} actual test matrix have been cleared. The basis of valuation of the casting trials was represented by the results of a dye penetrant inspection, which showed to be precise in identifying the for the topic important cold shut and oxide defects. This accuracy was proved by validation tests with CT and metallographic sections. The first results obtained show that using the inert gas flooding of the mold, the formation of cold shuts and by surface flooding induced oxides can be effectively avoided. As disadvantageous result of the inert gas flooding small sized oxides were identified, which are verisimilar products of the increased surface turbulences caused by the reduced thickness of the superficial oxide layer. The castability of thin walled piston sections could be further improved by setting a structured mold surface (waffle pattern), which potently counteracted cold shuts regardless of the casting atmosphere composition. A similar effect was anticipated from the use of fluorine-containing coating additives, however according the results such coatings could be regarded as ineffective in capturing the oxide mantle of the Al-melt. The critical role of the running system on the casting quality and robustness of the casting process was demonstrated by comparing the new, for inert gas casting designed geometry with a conventional alternative. The comparison of two fiber filter types confirmed the importance of the applied pressure loss in setting the flow conditions. Particularly in case of oversized gating systems the finer mesh filter can help to calm the flow and thus to suppress turbulences. The for inert gas casting designed gating system has been able to meet the expectations by securing a reproducible control over the mold filling procedure. The resulted reduction of the velocity and thus the kinetic energy of the flow, however increased the susceptibility to cold shuts. According to the results is therefore always a compromise in the choice of flow conditions (turbulences vs. cold shuts) required. The test results are suggestive of characteristic defects. The conventional geometry favored the formation of larger oxides, whereas in the novel geometry typically that of finer oxides. To determine the characteristic peculiarities of the oxide defects and the alleged causes, the found oxides were investigated and categorized by using electron microscopy and micrographs. In addition, the effect of the categorized oxide types on the formation of second phases in the piston microstructure was studied. The won results could be used as the cornerstone of a future defect catalogue for oxides in aluminum castings. In the last part of the work, the effect of surface phenomena on the mold filling simulations has been studied. Basis of all conducted simulations were values of the “surface parameter” measured using the pendant drop method. The newly introduced attribute surface parameter represents the sum of the surface tension and the strength of the oxide layer and was measured under air and technical inert gas atmospheres at varied temperatures. By using the latest {{developments in}} the simulation programs and considering the surface parameter of the melt, a strong convergence between simulations and reality could be achieved. For further improvement of the accuracy of future casting simulations, the optimized consideration of the surface oxidation procedure seems vital.

N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flushing</b> of raw milk has shown great potential to control bacterial growth in a temperature range of 6 to 12 °C without promoting undesired side effects. Here, the effect of N 2 gas (N) was tested as a single treatment and in combination with the lactoperoxidase system (NHT) on seven raw milk samples stored at 15 or 25 °C. For the ratio defined as bacterial counts from a certain treatment/counts on the corresponding control, a classical Analyse of Variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by mean comparison with the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test (REGWQ). Altogether, the growth inhibition was slightly but significantly higher at 25 °C than at 15 °C. Except for one sample, all ratios were lower for HT than for N alone; however, these differences were not judged to be significant for five samples by the REGWQ test; in the remaining two samples, N was more effective than HT in one case and less effective in the other case.

Cold storage of raw milk promotes the thriving of psychrotrophic/psychrotolerant bacteria, which are well known for their ability to produce enzymes that are frequently heat stable. However, these bacteria also carry antibiotic resistance (AR) features. In places, where no cold chain facilities are available and despite existing recommendations numerous adulterants, including antibiotics, are added to raw milk. Previously, N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flushing</b> showed real potential for hindering bacterial growth in raw milk at a storage temperature ranging from 6 to 25 ◦C. Here, the ability of N 2 gas (N) to tackle antibioticresistant bacteria was tested and compared to that of the activated lactoperoxidase system (HT) for three raw milk samples that were stored at 6 ◦C for 7 days. To that end, the mesophiles and psychrotrophs that were resistant to gentamycin (G), ceftazidime (Ce), levofloxacin (L), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) were enumerated. For the log 10 ratio (which is defined as the bacterial counts from a certain condition divided by the counts on the corresponding control), classical Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by a mean comparison with the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test (REGWQ). If the storage “time” factor was the major determinant of the recorded effects, cold storage alone or in combination with HT or with N promoted a sample-dependent response in consideration of the AR levels. The efficiency of N in limiting the increase in AR was highest for fresh raw milk and was judged to be equivalent to that of HT for one sample and superior to that of HT for the two other samples; moreover, compared to HT, N seemed to favor a more diverse community at 6 ◦C that was less heavily loaded with antibiotic multi-resistance features.

Culture-dependent methods indicated that the continuous N 2 gas-flushing of raw milk reduced the bacterial growth during cold storage by up to four orders of magnitude, compared to cold storage alone. This study investigated the influence of N 2 gas-flushing on bacterial diversity in bovine raw-milk samples, that were either cold stored at 6 °C or additionally flushed with pure N 2 for up to one week. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V 1 -V 2 hypervariable regions of 16 S rRNA genes, derived from amplified cDNA, which was obtained from RNA directly isolated from raw-milk samples, was performed. The reads, which were clustered into 2448 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were phylogenetically classified. Our data revealed a drastic reduction in the diversity of OTUs in raw milk during cold storage at 6 °C at 97 % similarity level; but, the N 2 -flushing treatment alleviated this reduction and substantially limited the loss of bacterial diversity during the same cold-storage period. Compared to cold-stored milk, the initial raw-milk samples contained less Proteobacteria (mainly Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae) but more Firmicutes (mainly Ruminococcaceaea, Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceaea) and Bacteroidetes (mainly Bacteroidales). Significant differences between cold-stored and additionally N 2 -flushed milk were mainly related {{to higher levels of}} Pseudomononadaceae (including the genera Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter) in cold-stored milk samples; furthermore, rare taxa were better preserved by the N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flushing</b> compared to the cold storage alone.

In this study, the storage stability of unwashed sliced (high surface starch) potatoes (crisps) fried in regular sunflower oil (SO) or in high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) was compared over accelerated shelf life testing (45 °C, 6 weeks); with and without nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>flushing.</b> Primary oxidation products (lipid hydroperoxides) were measured with a ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay and volatile secondary oxidation products (hexanal) were quantified by using solid phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS). Results revealed that crisps fried in SO were the least stable. Flushing the stored crisps with nitrogen gas proved {{to be effective in}} slowing down the oxidation rate after frying with sunflower oil, significantly stabilizing the crisps. However, crisps fried in HOSO were the most stable, with the lowest rate of development of oxidation markers, and this has previously not been shown for crisps with a high free starch content...|$|R
40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect between modified atmosphere and potassium permanganate based ethylene scrubber on ripening behaviour of unripe banana fruits was evaluated at 13 ± 1 °C followed by ethrel induced ripening at 30 ± 1 °C. The type of modified atmospheres consisted of passive mode [prepackaged in polyethylene (PE) pouches] {{as well as}} active modes [gas flushed with 3 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 in PE pouches and partial vacuum (400 mmHg) packaged]. The passive mode, <b>gas</b> <b>flushing</b> and vacuum packaging resulted in shelf-life extension to 15, 24 and 32 days, respectively as against shelf-life of 12 days for the experimental control. Application of ethylene scrubber in combination with silica gel as desiccant and soda-lime as CO 2 scrubber further enhanced the shelf-life to 18, 28 and 36 days under {{the different types of}} modified atmospheres specified. The synergistism was shown through ripening retardation characterized by late onset of respiratory climacteric, delayed degreening and restricted softening during ripening of banana...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of whey protein films packaging was evaluated. The packaging system consisted of whey protein films closing the top extremity of synthetic plastic container. Slices of apple were packed and stored {{at room temperature}} (25 °C) and at 10 °C. Modified atmosphere packaging (N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flushing)</b> was studied to verify the oxygen permeability of the films. Whey protein films (6. 5 % of protein, 3. 0 % of glycerol, and pH 7. 0) were obtained by thermal denaturation, emulsification (0. 5 % (w/w) with stearic acid), and enzymatic modification (10 U/g protein of transglutaminase, ACTIVA-TG). Mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at break), water vapor permeability, and color-opacity properties of different films were evaluated. The film integrity was observed during the packaging and storage processing associated to the good mechanical properties. The water vapor permeability was evaluated by weight loss, moisture content, and texture profile of apple slices. The {{results showed that the}} whey protein films presented a moderated moisture barrier if compared with systems with no covering. The browning of the apple slices was investigated associated to the polyphenoloxidase action in presence of oxygen...|$|R
50|$|Laboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally {{similar to}} hydrogenation, {{and may be}} {{accomplished}} at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen <b>gas,</b> having <b>flushed</b> the apparatus with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Parr hydrogenator) or similar piece of equipment is required.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been found that when the gases are drawn out from the sewer by the burning of {{ordinary}} <b>gas</b> a sudden <b>flushing</b> of the sewer might prevent any sewer gas from escaping, and thus momentarily cause the gas jets to be extinguished.|$|R
30|$|Many of {{the studies}} try to {{establish}} anaerobic conditions using an inert <b>gas</b> for <b>flushing</b> headspace or solutions {{at the beginning of}} the experiments. Flow-through systems and batch systems (static or semi-static systems) are used. There is only one publication reporting a real flow-through system [2]. Ali et al. worked with a continuous flow-through of N 2 and O 2 in a defined ratio to establish a redox potential between − 100 and + 350  mV. With the addition of HCl or NaOH, the pH was adjusted.|$|R
500|$|The US 3rd Brigade {{subsequently}} also {{uncovered a}} significant tunnel complex, after Sergeant Stewart Green from US 1/28th Battalion accidentally {{sat down on}} a nail and uncovered a trap door on 11 January. Volunteering to enter the tunnel, Green then located an underground dispensary occupied by more than 30 Viet Cong who subsequently escaped. Later a smoke machine was used to pump smoke into the tunnel system, and this was successful in locating numerous tunnel entrances and bunkers as the smoke rose above the jungle canopy. They were the first American troops to enter the tunnels, and they proceeded to attack them with CS gas, and later explosives. However, such tactics met with limited success with the tear <b>gas</b> <b>flushing</b> out large numbers of women and children, but few Viet Cong. Led by Green, a squad of Americans equipped with flashlights, pistols and a field telephone penetrated over [...] of the tunnel system before becoming involved in a fire-fight with the Viet Cong. Wearing gas-masks the Americans threw gas grenades and fought their way back to the tunnel entrance, but one soldier became lost in the darkness and Green re-entered the tunnel to find him. The Viet Cong subsequently withdrew.|$|R
