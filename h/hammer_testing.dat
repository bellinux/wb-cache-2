50|$|There {{are several}} ways to do modal testing but impact <b>hammer</b> <b>testing</b> and shaker (vibration tester) testing are commonplace. In both cases energy is {{supplied}} to the system with a known frequency content. Where structural resonances occur there will be an amplification of the response, clearly seen in the response spectra. Using the response spectra and force spectra, a transfer function can be obtained. The transfer function (or frequency response function (FRF)) is often curve fitted to estimate the modal parameters; however, there are many methods of modal parameter estimation and it is the topic of much research.|$|E
50|$|An ideal {{impact to}} a {{structure}} {{is a perfect}} impulse, which has an infinitely small duration, causing a constant amplitude in the frequency domain; this would result in all modes of vibration being excited with equal energy. The impact hammer test is designed to replicate this; however, in reality a hammer strike cannot last for an infinitely small duration, but has a known contact time. The duration of the contact time directly influences the frequency content of the force, with a larger contact time causing a smaller range of bandwidth. A load cell {{is attached to the}} end of the hammer to record the force. Impact <b>hammer</b> <b>testing</b> is ideal for small light weight structures; however as the size of the structure increases issues can occur due to a poor signal to noise ratio. This is common on large civil engineering structures.|$|E

40|$|Impact hammer is {{the current}} modal testing way in Dynapac testing department. Due to highly damped {{characteristic}} of big construction machines, {{there are a few}} weaknesses for modal testing when using hammer, such as short response time, limited frequency resolution, poor quality of frequency response functions. Therefore, a more advanced excitation equipment is needed to improve the measurement quality. The object for this study is to compare two different measuring methods. The thesis will show a comparison between the <b>hammer</b> <b>testing</b> and the shaker MIMO testing compared with analytical model in a highly damped system. It will also give a reference for further highly damped modal analysis and budgetary assessment to decide the budget expenditure. Result from shaker testing shows a little better correlation than <b>hammer</b> <b>testing</b> compared with FEM model. While the correlation between FEM model and measurement is bad due to many reasons, such as many local modes that can not excited, lack of excitation points, unexpected noise and error from the measurement.

40|$|Mechanical joints {{can have}} {{significant}} {{effects on the}} dynamics of assembled structures. The goal of our work is to develop physics based, reduced-order, finite element models {{that are capable of}} replicating the effects of joints on vibrating structures. Various studies have shown that micro- and macroslip along the joint interface cause the interface stiffness to change and introduce energy dissipation, leading to the observed hysteresis. The authors recently developed the so-called adjusted Iwan beam element (AIBE) for finite element analysis of jointed beam structures. The element consists of two adjusted Iwan models that are arranged to give two-dimensional beam behavior. The adjusted Iwan model is a combination of springs and factional sliders that exhibits hysteretic behavior due to the stick-slip behavior of the sliders. In this paper, the sensitivity of the performance of an adjusted Iwan model, particularly its capacity to dissipate energy, to variations in its parameters is studied. Parametric analysis is also carried out on the adjusted Iwan beam element to investigate the effects of joint parameters on dynamic responses of jointed beams. <b>Hammer</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted on a jointed beam and its monolithic counterpart. The decay envelopes of impulsive responses for the two systems exhibit distinctly different dynamic properties. To verify that the adjusted Iwan beam element is capable of actually modeling the effects of joints on a vibrating structure, numerical simulations are performed of two <b>hammer</b> <b>tests</b> with different forcing levels. The joint parameters of the jointed beam are identified from the experimentally-obtained acceleration response from one <b>hammer</b> <b>test</b> by using a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFF). Then, using the identified joint parameters, acceleration responses of the jointed beam in the other <b>hammer</b> <b>test</b> are predicted.

40|$|Abstract. Chatter {{vibration}} {{in cutting}} processes usually leads to surface finish degradation, tool damage, cutting noise, energy loss, etc. Self-excited vibration particularly {{seems to be}} a problem that is easily increased to large vibration. The regenerative effect is considered as one of the causes of chatter vibration. Although the chatter vibration occurs in various types of processing, the end-milling is a typical process that seems to cause the chatter vibration {{due to a lack of}} rigidity of one or more parts of the machine tools, cutting tool, and work-piece. The aim of our research is to propose a simple method to control chatter vibration of the end-milling process on the basis of a coupling model integrating the related various elements. In this study, <b>hammering</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out to measure the transfer function of a machine tool and cutting tool system, which seems to cause vibration. By comparing these results, finite elemental method (FEM) analysis models were constructed. Additionally, cutting experiments were carried out to confirm the chatter vibration frequencies in end-milling with a machining center. In the <b>hammering</b> <b>tests,</b> impulse <b>hammer</b> and multiple acceleration pick-ups are connected to a multi-channel FFT analyzer and estimate the natural frequencies and natural vibration modes. A simplified FEM model is proposed by circular section stepped beam elements on the basis of the <b>hammering</b> <b>test</b> results, considering a coupling effect. In comparisons of the calculated results and <b>hammering</b> <b>test</b> results, the vibration modes are in good agreement. As a result, the proposed model accurately predicts the chatter vibration considering several effects among the relating elements in end-milling. Moreover, it can be seen that the chatter vibration is investigated from a viewpoint of the integrating model of the end-milling process...|$|R

First, a reference dynamic behavior is defined in the frequency domain of 50 - 1200 Hz based on field <b>hammer</b> <b>test</b> measurements performed on a IRJ baseline (i. e., a set of IRJ without visible damage). Then, measurements on IRJs with different damage states are compared to the IRJ baseline response via the frequency response function (FRF) based statistical method. Three cases of IRJs are analyzed: a IRJ with a broken fastening, a IRJ with a damaged insulation layer and a IRJ with a rail top with plastic deformation. Combining <b>hammer</b> <b>test</b> measurements, hardness measurements and pictures of the IRJs, two frequency bands were identified as characteristic for damaged IRJs.
