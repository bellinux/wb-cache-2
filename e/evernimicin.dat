40|$|<b>Evernimicin</b> (SCH 27899) {{is a new}} {{antibiotic}} {{with activity}} against {{a wide spectrum of}} gram-positive bacteria and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Previous metabolic labeling studies indicated that <b>evernimicin</b> specifically inhibited protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. Using a susceptible Escherichia coli strain, we demonstrated that <b>evernimicin</b> also inhibited protein synthesis in E. coli. In cell-free translation assays with extracts from either E. coli or S. aureus, <b>evernimicin</b> had a 50 % inhibitory concentration of approximately 125 nM. In contrast, cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes were inhibited only by very high levels of <b>evernimicin.</b> <b>Evernimicin</b> did not promote transcript misreading. [14 C]evernimicin specifically bound to the 50 S subunit from E. coli. Nonlinear regression analysis of binding data generated with 70 S ribosomes from E. coli and S. aureus and 50 S subunits from E. coli returned dissociation constants of 84, 86, and 160 nM, respectively. In binding experiments, performed in the presence of excess quantities of a selection of antibiotics known to bind to the 50 S subunit, only the structurally similar drug avilamycin blocked binding of [14 C]evernimicin to ribosomes...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP# 5) {{that showed}} decreased susceptibility to <b>evernimicin</b> (MIC, 1. 5 μg/ml) was investigated. A 4, 255 -bp EcoRI fragment cloned from SP# 5 was identified by {{its ability to}} transform evernimicin-susceptible S. pneumoniae R 6 (MIC, 0. 03 μg/ml) such that the <b>evernimicin</b> MIC was 1. 5 μg/ml. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment revealed that it contained portions of the S 10 -spc ribosomal protein operons. The nucleotide sequences of resistant and susceptible isolates were compared, and a point mutation (thymine to guanine) that causes an Ile 52 -Ser substitution in ribosomal protein L 16 was identified. The role of this mutation in decreasing susceptibility to <b>evernimicin</b> was confirmed by direct transformation of the altered L 16 gene. The presence of the L 16 mutation in the resistant strain suggests that <b>evernimicin</b> is an inhibitor of protein synthesis. This was confirmed by inhibition studies using radiolabeled substrates, which showed that the addition of <b>evernimicin</b> at sub-MIC levels resulted in a rapid decrease in the incorporation of radiolabeled isoleucine in a susceptible isolate (SP# 3) but was much less effective against SP# 5. The incorporation of isoleucine showed a linear response to the dose level of <b>evernimicin.</b> The incorporation of other classes of labeled substrates was unaffected or much delayed, indicating that these were secondary effects...|$|E
40|$|The MICs of <b>evernimicin</b> {{at which}} 90 % of Borrelia burgdorferi patient {{isolates}} were inhibited ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 5 μg/ml. <b>Evernimicin</b> was {{as effective as}} ceftriaxone against B. burgdorferi in a murine model of experimental Lyme disease. As assessed by culturing the urinary bladders of infected C 3 H mice, no live Borrelia isolates were recoverable following antibiotic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus faecium strain 9631355 was {{isolated}} from animal sources {{on the basis}} of its resistance to the growth promotant avilamycin. The strain also exhibited high-level resistance to <b>evernimicin,</b> a drug undergoing evaluation as a therapeutic agent in humans. Ribosomes from strain 9631355 exhibited a dramatic reduction in <b>evernimicin</b> binding, shown by both cell-free translation assays and direct-binding assays. The resistance determinant was cloned from strain 9631355; sequence alignments suggested it was a methyltransferase and therefore it was designated emtA for <b>evernimicin</b> methyltransferase. <b>Evernimicin</b> resistance was transmissible and emtA was localized to a plasmid-borne insertion element. Purified EmtA methylated 50 S subunits from an evernimicin-sensitive strain 30 -fold more efficiently than those from a resistant strain. Reverse transcription identified a pause site that was unique to the 23 S rRNA extracted from resistant ribosomes. The pause corresponded to methylation of residue G 2470 (Escherichia coli numbering). RNA footprinting revealed that G 2470 is located within the evernimicin-binding site on the ribosome, thus providin...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there exist}} few {{satisfactory}} alternatives to vancomycin for therapy of serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. We employed a rat model of aortic valve endocarditis {{to assess the}} potential efficacy of <b>evernimicin</b> (SCH 27899) compared with vancomycin against infection with a strain susceptible to both agents (MICs of 0. 25 and 0. 50 μg/ml, respectively). Infected animals were {{assigned to one of}} three groups: controls (no treatment), <b>evernimicin</b> at 60 mg/kg of body weight by intravenous (i. v.) infusion once daily, or vancomycin at 150 mg/kg of body weight per day by continuous i. v. infusion. Therapy was administered for 5. 5 days. At the start of therapy, colony counts in vegetations were 6. 63 ± 0. 44 log 10 CFU/g. In both treatment groups, bacterial density within vegetations was significantly reduced in comparison with control animals that had not been treated. Final colony counts were as follows (mean ± standard deviation) : controls, 10. 12 ± 1. 51 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation; <b>evernimicin,</b> 7. 22 ± 2. 91 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation; vancomycin, 5. 65 ± 1. 76 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation. The difference between the <b>evernimicin</b> and vancomycin groups was not significant. These results confirmed the bacteriostatic activity of <b>evernimicin</b> in vivo in an experimental model of severe MRSA infection...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} efficacy of <b>evernimicin</b> (SCH 27899) against serious enterococcal infections, {{we used a}} rat model of aortic valve endocarditis established with either a vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis or a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain. Animals infected with either one of the test strains were assigned to receive no treatment (controls) or 5 -day therapy {{with one of the}} following regimens: <b>evernimicin</b> 60 -mg/kg of body weight intravenous (i. v.) bolus once daily, 60 -mg/kg i. v. bolus twice daily (b. i. d.), 60 mg/kg/day i. v. by continuous infusion, or 120 mg/kg/day i. v. by continuous infusion. These regimens were compared with vancomycin at 150 mg/kg/day. In animals infected with E. faecalis, <b>evernimicin</b> at 120 mg/kg/day by continuous infusion significantly reduced bacterial counts in vegetations (final density, 5. 75 ± 3. 38 log 10 CFU/g) compared with controls (8. 51 ± 1. 11 log 10 CFU/g). In animals infected with 0. 5 ml of an 8 × 107 -CFU/ml inoculum of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, both 60 -mg/kg bolus once a day and b. i. d. dose regimens of <b>evernimicin</b> were very effective (viable counts, 3. 45 ± 1. 44 and 3. 81 ± 1. 98 log 10 CFU/g, respectively). Vancomycin was unexpectedly active against infections induced with that inoculum. In animals infected with a 109 -CFU/ml inoculum of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, the <b>evernimicin</b> 60 -mg/kg i. v. bolus b. i. d. reduced viable counts in vegetations compared with controls (6. 27 ± 1. 63 versus 8. 34 ± 0. 91 log 10 CFU/g; P < 0. 05), whereas vancomycin was ineffective. Although resistant colonies could be selected in vitro, {{we were not able to}} identify evernimicin-resistant clones from cardiac vegetations. An unexplained observation from these experiments was the great variability in final bacterial densities within cardiac vegetations from animals in each of the <b>evernimicin</b> treatment groups...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{mutagenesis}} of Staphylococcus aureus RN 450 generated two strains that {{displayed a}} stable reduction (30 - to 60 -fold) in susceptibility to <b>evernimicin.</b> Cell-free translation reactions {{demonstrated that the}} resistance determinant was located in the ribosomal fraction. Compared to ribosomes isolated from a wild-type strain, ribosomes from the mutant strains displayed an 8 - to 10 -fold reduction in affinity for [14 C]evernimicin. In contrast, the mutants displayed no alteration in either binding affinity or in vitro susceptibility to erythromycin. Exponential cultures of the mutant strains accumulated significantly less [14 C]evernimicin than the wild-type strain, suggesting that accumulation {{is dependent on the}} high affinity that <b>evernimicin</b> displays for its binding site. Sequencing rplP (encodes ribosomal protein L 16) in the mutant strains revealed a single base change in each strain, which resulted in a substitution of either cysteine or histidine for arginine at residue 51. Introduction of a multicopy plasmid carrying wild-type rplP into the mutant strains restored sensitivity to <b>evernimicin,</b> confirming that the alterations in rplP were responsible for the change in susceptibility. Overexpression of the mutant alleles in S. aureus RN 450 had no effect on susceptibility to <b>evernimicin,</b> demonstrating that susceptibility is dominant over resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the everninomicin {{antibiotic}} <b>evernimicin</b> (SCH 27899) on growing Staphylococcus aureus cells were investigated. Cellular growth rates and viable cell numbers decreased with increasing antibiotic concentrations. The rate of protein synthesis, measured as 35 S-amino acid incorporation, declined in parallel with the growth rate. Significantly, {{the formation of the}} 50 S ribosomal subunit was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion as well. 30 S ribosomal subunit synthesis was not affected over the same concentration range. <b>Evernimicin</b> did not stimulate the breakdown of mature ribosomal subunits. Pulse-chase labeling experiments revealed a reduced rate of 50 S subunit formation in drug-treated cells. Two erythromycin-resistant strains of S. aureus that carried the ermC gene were as sensitive as wild-type cells to antibiotic inhibition. In addition, two methicillin-resistant S. aureus organisms, one sensitive to erythromycin and one resistant to the macrolide, showed similar sensitivities to <b>evernimicin.</b> These results suggest a use for this novel antimicrobial agent against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{collect and}} analyze data on {{susceptibility}} of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to <b>evernimicin</b> and other antimicrobial agents. MethodsRecent clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci from 33 laboratories in North America, Europe and South Africa were investigated. ResultsOf the antimicrobial agents tested, <b>evernimicin</b> {{had the lowest}} MIC 90 s for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (0. 75 and 1. 0 mg/L, respectively). Resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was widespread, {{with higher levels of}} resistance in North America than in other regions. ConclusionsSusceptibility surveys help to determine the antimicrobial activity of new agents. Ciprofloxacin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci were prevalent throughout all regions...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous mutants of {{susceptible}} {{clinical and}} laboratory isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibiting reduced susceptibility to <b>evernimicin</b> (SCH 27899; MIC, 0. 5 to 4. 0 mg/liter) were selected on plates containing <b>evernimicin.</b> Four isolates {{that did not}} harbor mutations in rplP (which encodes ribosomal protein L 16) were further analyzed. Whole chromosomal DNA or PCR products of the 23 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) operons from these mutants {{could be used to}} transform the susceptible S. pneumoniae strain R 6 to resistance at frequencies of 10 − 5 and 10 − 4, respectively, rates 10 - to 100 -fold lower than that for a single-allele chromosomal marker. The transformants appeared slowly (48 to 72 h) on selective medium, and primary transformants passaged on nonselective medium produced single colonies that displayed heterogeneous susceptibilities to <b>evernimicin.</b> A single passage on selective medium of colonies derived from a single primary transformant homogenized the resistance phenotype. Sequence analysis of the 23 S rDNA and rRNA from the resistant mutants revealed single, unique mutations in each isolate at the equivalent Escherichia coli positions 2469 (A → C), 2480 (C → T), 2535 (G → A), and 2536 (G → C). The mutations map within two different stems of the peptidyltransferase region of domain V. Because multiple copies of rDNA are present in the chromosome, gene conversion between mutant and wild-type 23 S rDNA alleles may be necessary for stable resistance. Additionally, none of the characterized mutants showed cross-resistance to any of a spectrum of protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that the target site of <b>evernimicin</b> may be unique...|$|E
40|$|Six {{high-level}} evernimicin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates {{were identified}} among 304 avilamycin-resistant E. faecium isolates from animals and 404 stool samples from humans with diarrhea. All four animal isolates, {{and one of}} the human isolates, were able to transfer resistance to a susceptible E. faecium strain. The resulting transconjugants all tested positive for the presence of emtA, a gene encoding a methyltransferase previously linked with high-level <b>evernimicin</b> resistance. The four transconjugants derived from animal isolates all carried the same plasmid, while a differently sized plasmid was found in the isolate from humans. This study demonstrated a low incidence of high-level <b>evernimicin</b> resistance mediated by the emtA gene in different E. faecium isolates of animal and human origin...|$|E
40|$|The susceptibilities of Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum {{to eight}} new {{antimicrobial}} agents {{were determined by}} agar dilution. M. pneumoniae was susceptible to the new glycylcycline GAR- 936 at 0. 12 μg/ml and <b>evernimicin</b> at 4 μg/ml, but it was resistant to linezolid. It was most susceptible to dirithromycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, telithromycin, reference macrolides, and josamycin. M. hominis was susceptible to linezolid, <b>evernimicin,</b> and GAR- 936. It was resistant to macrolides and the ketolide telithromycin but susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin and josamycin. U. urealyticum was susceptible to <b>evernimicin</b> (8 to 16 μg/ml) and resistant to linezolid. It was less susceptible to GAR- 936 (4. 0 μg/ml) than to tetracycline (0. 5 μg/ml). Telithromycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin were the most active agents against ureaplasmas (0. 06 μg/ml). The new quinolone gatifloxacin was active against M. pneumoniae and M. hominis at 0. 12 to 0. 25 μg/ml and active against ureaplasmas at 1. 0 μg/ml. The MICs of macrolides were markedly affected by pH, with an 8 - to 32 -fold increase in the susceptibility of M. pneumoniae as the pH increased from 6. 9 to 7. 8. A similar increase in susceptibility with increasing pH was also observed with ureaplasmas. Tetracyclines showed a fourfold increase of activity as the pH decreased 1 U, whereas GAR- 936 showed a fourfold decrease in activity with a decrease in pH...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{growth promoter}} avilamycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Here the binding site is further characterized on Escherichia coli ribosomes. The drug interacts with domain V of 23 S rRNA, giving a chemical footprint at nucleotides A 2482 and A 2534. Selection of avilamycin-resistant Halobac-terium halobium cells revealed mutations in helix 89 of 23 S rRNA. Furthermore, mutations in helices 89 and 91, which have previously {{been shown to}} confer resistance to <b>evernimicin,</b> give cross-resistance to avilamycin. These data place the binding site of avilamycin on 23 S rRNA close to the elbow of A-site tRNA. It is inferred that avilamycin interacts with the ribosomes at the ribosomal A-site interfering with initiation factor IF 2 and tRNA binding {{in a manner similar}} to <b>evernimicin.</b> Molecular models resulting from the recent identification of X-ray crystal structures of ribosomal subunits and rRNA com-ponents of the binding site of antibiotics (6, 9, 15, 22) are notable new tools for drug design.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues in the design of phase II/III clinical trials of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. The choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the MIC, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. It is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be {{made on the basis of}} the pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of MICs for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the PK parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the PD target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. In performing this study with the new anti-infective agent <b>evernimicin,</b> we collected a large number (n = 4, 543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and determined the MICs using E-test methods (AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for susceptibility to <b>evernimicin.</b> Population PK data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using NPEM III. PD targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: S. pneumoniae (n = 5), E. faecalis (n = 2), and S. aureus (n = 4). Drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/MIC (AUC/MIC) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. There were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (107 CFU), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log 10), or 90 % maximal killing effect (90 % Emax). The levels of protein binding in humans and mice were similar. The PK and PD of 6 and 9 mg of <b>evernimicin</b> per kg of body weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five Monte Carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. The fractional probability of attaining the three PD targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. All differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target AUC/MIC in this PD model were significant. For S. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three PD targets was high for both doses. For S. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6 - and 9 -mg/kg <b>evernimicin</b> doses for reaching the 2 log killing (S. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90 % Emax AUC/MIC targets. This same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro MIC breakpoints...|$|E
40|$|Ziracine), which {{belong to}} the everninomicin class of drugs, are {{oligosaccharide}} antibiotics active against numerous gram-positive bacteria, including emerging pathogens such as glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (1, 2). The two drugs share the same mode of action—inhibition of translation—by binding to the same target in the large 50 S ribosomal subunit (3). As a result, they also display crossresistance: bacteria resistant to avilamycin are resistant to <b>evernimicin</b> (and vice versa), but not to other classes of drugs (4).

40|$|SummaryThe {{ribosome}} {{is a major}} {{target in}} the bacterial cell for antibiotics. Here, we dissect the effects that the thiopeptide antibiotics thiostrepton (ThS) and micrococcin (MiC) {{as well as the}} orthosomycin antibiotic <b>evernimicin</b> (Evn) have on translational GTPases. We demonstrate that, like ThS, MiC is a translocation inhibitor, and that the activation by MiC of the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-G is dependent on the presence of the ribosomal proteins L 7 /L 12 as well as the G′ subdomain of EF-G. In contrast, Evn does not inhibit translocation but is a potent inhibitor of back-translocation as well as IF 2 -dependent 70 S-initiation complex formation. Collectively, these results shed insight not only into fundamental aspects of translation but also into the unappreciated specificities of these classes of translational inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Evernimicin</b> (Evn), an {{oligosaccharide}} antibiotic, {{interacts with}} the large ribosomal subunit and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. RNA probing demonstrated that the drug protects {{a specific set of}} nucleotides in the loops of hairpins 89 and 91 of 23 S rRNA in bacterial and archaeal ribosomes. Spontaneous Evn-resistant mutants of Halobacterium halobium contained mutations in hairpins 89 and 91 of 23 S rRNA. In the ribosome tertiary structure, rRNA residues involved in interaction with the drug form a tight cluster that delineates the drug-binding site. Resistance mutations in the bacterial ribosomal protein L 16, which is shown to be homologous to archaeal protein L 10 e, cluster to the same region as the rRNA mutations. The Evn-binding site overlaps with the binding site of initiation factor 2. Evn inhibits activity of initiation factor 2 in vitro, suggesting that the drug interferes with formation of the 70 S initiation complex. The site of Evn binding and its mode of action are distinct from other ribosome-targeted antibiotics. This antibiotic target site can potentially be used for the development of new antibacterial drugs...|$|E
