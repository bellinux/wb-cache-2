5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team.

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
