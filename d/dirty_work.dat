Although successful as a digger, and with more gold in his possession than he knew what to do with, he detested the <b>dirty,</b> laborious <b>work</b> of digging and dabbling in mud from morning till night.

25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} {{had a sense}} of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence.

Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his <b>dirty</b> <b>work,</b> amongst other things.|$|E

25|$|VOC’s dire {{situation}} {{after the}} Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did {{not escape the}} king’s attention, but– like Amangkurat II– he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma {{to do all the}} <b>dirty</b> <b>work,</b> such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August and they were all wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.|$|E

50|$|After {{graduating from}} the Kubert School, Warren spent a year {{attempting}} to acquire the rights to produce a comic based on the Dirty Pair. He {{was finally able to}} make inroads with the help of Toren Smith and Studio Proteus, who had connections in Japan. Warren put together a portfolio of <b>Dirty</b> Pair-related <b>work</b> which Smith then took to Sunrise Studios, but they were unimpressed with the work and negotiations went nowhere. Smith then contacted Takachiho Haruka, the creator of the Dirty Pair, directly. Haruka was much more impressed with Warren's art and Smith's ideas and agreed to license the characters for an American comic. This directly resulted in Warren's first major <b>work,</b> <b>Dirty</b> Pair: Biohazards, which he co-wrote with Smith and published through Studio Proteus and Eclipse Comics in 1989. The next two <b>Dirty</b> Pair <b>works</b> would be co-written with Smith and released by Eclipse Comics.

40|$|The geochemical {{analysis}} of soil {{samples from the}} Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester, Hampshire, UK) has been undertaken {{in order to enhance}} our understanding of urban occupation during the late first/early second century AD. Samples taken from a variety of occupation deposits within several, contemporary timber buildings, including associated hearths, have been analysed using laboratory-based x-ray fluorescence for a suite of elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, Sr, P and Ca). The patterns of elemental enrichment seen across the site have allowed us to compare and contrast the buildings that were occupied during this time in an attempt to distinguish different uses, such as between domestic and work-space. Two of the buildings stand out as having high concentrations of elements which suggest that they were <b>dirtier</b> <b>work</b> spaces, whilst other buildings appear to be have lower chemical loadings suggesting they were cleaner...|$|R
