5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have {{a visceral}} and {{emotional}} reaction to things, {{rather than to}} have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people to be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> laugh. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it away. I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step. It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get out of the album.|$|E

He explained: [...] "I consciously kept changing engineers because <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> {{think that they were}} responsible for our sound. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know it was me." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{development}} Richard Hofmeier {{experimented with}} many elements which were eventually removed, including a fourth character {{and a number}} of extra stores and locations. At the 2013 Independent Games Festival, Hofmeier spray painted his own booth to instead display Porpentine's game Howling Dogs, saying that he thought [...] "Cart Life had already overstayed its welcome... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> see this game." ...|$|R
500|$|... "When I wrote American Life, I {{was very}} {{agitated}} {{by what was}} going on in the world around me, [...] I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest. I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{going to}} have themes and there'll {{be a lot of}} {{audience}} interaction. My live show will have a lot of that— a lot of dancing, a joie de vivre. I feel such freedom on stage. It's such a rush to be performing. I like to see everybody's faces on stage, to see the reaction. Normally, you can only see the front row because of the lights. So you'll see a lot of (my) energy... but there are also going to be other moments that I hope are artistically energetic. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel things up close" ...|$|E
500|$|McGovern's legacy also {{includes}} {{his commitment to}} combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. He said, [...] "After I'm gone, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> say about me: He did {{the best he could}} to end hunger in this country and the world." [...] In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history. Responding to the Serenity Prayer's desire to [...] "grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change", McGovern said simply that he rejected that notion: [...] "I keep trying to change them." ...|$|E
5000|$|We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> portray Yolngu <b>people</b> {{having a}} good time... we had the {{political}} stuff in the first clip... it is political enough {{in the sense that}} it is showing a positive, healthy and strong side of Aboriginal culture - that's the best message of all... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> dance, pick up on the movements and Yolgnu style of dancing. Stephen Johnson ...|$|R
5000|$|Perry, {{the child}} in the crib, has spoken about the {{problems}} he faced growing up. [...] "All the way through school I was a bully because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hurt as bad as I did. I hated everything and everybody," [...] he said.

500|$|Gaga {{said the}} song [...] "was just me {{trying to figure}} things out", and she later stated that she [...] "was {{doing a lot of}} drugs" [...] when she wrote the song. She claims it is about how [...] "whoever you are or where you live – you can self-proclaim this inner fame based on your {{personal}} style, and your opinions about art and the world, despite being conscious of it", and also about her experiences as a struggling artist working in the Lower East Side. The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with. She added that [...] "ultimately what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> take from it is 'Bang-bang.' No matter who you are and where you come from, you can feel beautiful and dirty rich." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

5000|$|I wrote {{all night}} long, {{seven days a}} week, single space, no paragraphs, front and back of the pages, {{pounding}} the keys so hard the tips of my fingers would hurt. I couldn't stop writing, and I remember feeling more alive than I had ever felt. Convinced that I was destined to die young, I struggled to leave something of meaning behind, {{to rise above the}} darkness and despair. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> them to know what it really meant to be in a war — to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward — not the myth we had grown up believing. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence.

5000|$|My desire {{was to make}} This Christmas an {{intimate}} album, not something too ostentatious or showy. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to play}} it around the house or in the car during the holidays, and make us part of your celebration. Gathering around house listening to Christmas music has always been an important part of that time of the year to my family. — Travolta about the album creation process.|$|R
500|$|Norman Schwarzkopf was {{described}} by childhood friends as active and assertive, protective of his sisters and a skilled athlete. He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because – as he said afterwards – [...] "Some day when I become a general, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know that I’m serious." [...] In 1946, when Norman Schwarzkopf was 12, he moved with his father to Tehran, Iran. In Iran, Norman learned shooting, horseback riding, and hunting. Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly {{before returning to the}} United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father's example.|$|E
500|$|... 8701 was {{recorded}} in the United States, in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis and Atlanta. The album's production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy—who had produced the majority of Usher's previous album, My Way—Babyface, Kevin [...] "She'kspere" [...] Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, {{and asked them to}} produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created [...] "Can U Help Me". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single [...] "U Remind Me", explaining [...] "we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> just go, he can sing.|$|E
500|$|While {{establishing}} {{herself as}} an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, The Fame. Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel a part of this lifestyle." [...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E

In an interview, Donohue said, [...] "Unlike Hitchens, who wrote a 98-page book with no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography, no attribution at all, just 98 pages of unsupported opinion, I have a short book too.

2500|$|Oshii noted his {{attention}} to detail might be particularly Japanese: [...] "I get absorbed in the finer points [...] like what {{the back of a}} bottle label looks like when you see it through the glass [...] That's very Japanese, I suppose. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> go back to the film again and again to pick up things they missed the first time." [...] Describing the overall look, the director said, [...] "The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. And as I said, there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at some of the things I liked as a child — the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world — not a future world." ...|$|E

I can't stand {{the idea that}} two million people are in {{imminent}} danger of starving to death, many of them children, [...] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die.
