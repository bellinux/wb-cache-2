5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|Electronic version {{excludes}} illustrations {{for which}} permission {{has not been}} granted by the rights holderThe history, practice and aesthetic of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> in photography is elucidated and developed from its earliest statements of need to the current time with a particular emphasis on {{its role in the}} development of the Pictorialist movement. Using William Crawford's concept of photographic 'syntax', the use of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is explored as an example of how technology shapes style. 	A detailed study of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> from the earliest forms to the present is presented, enumerating the core properties of pinhole, early experimental and commercial soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses.</b> This was researched via published texts in period journals, advertising, private correspondence, interviews, and the lenses themselves. The author conducted a wide range of in-studio experiments with both period and contemporary soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> to evaluate their character and distinct features, as well as to validate source material. 	Nodal points of this history and development are explored in the critical debate between the diffuse and sharp photographic image, beginning with the competition between the calotype and daguerreotype. The role of George Davison's The Old Farmstead is presented as well as the invention of the first modern soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> the Dallmeyer-Bergheim, and its function in the development of the popular Pictorialist lens, the Pinkham & Smith Semi-Achromatic. The trajectory of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is plotted against the Pictorialist movement, noting the correlation betwixt them, and the modern renaissance of soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> and the diffuse aesthetic. 	This thesis presents a unique history of photography modeled around the determining character of technology and the interdependency of syntax, style and art...|$|R

Theoretical design of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is carried out}} according {{to the principle of}} grazing incidence, and key parameters of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> are determined. The materials of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> and the preparation technologies such as the coating process are discussed.

2500|$|The first proto-eyes evolved among animals [...] {{about the}} time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common {{ancestor}} of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive panel of cells, known as the retina, {{at the rear of the}} eye. The cone cells (for colour) and the rod cells (for low-light contrasts) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision. The visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. Such eyes are typically roughly spherical, filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour, with a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> and often an iris; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye, and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses.|$|E

50|$|Overhead {{projectors}} normally {{include a}} manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers {{the position of}} the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the lens) to focus at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This permits a range of projection distances.|$|E
50|$|An {{overhead}} projector {{works on the}} same principle as a 35mm slide projector, in which a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally {{the size of a}} printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and <b>focusing</b> <b>lens),</b> in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side opposite the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} size of {{an internal}} <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> does not change during focus, nor does {{the front of the}} lens rotate. This is particularly useful for large lenses, keeping the size more compact, or when using filters or accessories mounted {{on the front of the}} lens that may require careful alignment.One issue internal <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> can have is that the true focal length of the lens is reduced when not focused at infinity.|$|E

50|$|The {{cylinder}} lens {{consists of}} defocusing lens, a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> {{and a second}} defocusing lens, with the sum of their refractive powers being zero. But because there is some distance between the lenses, the electron makes three turns and hits the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> at a position {{farther away from the}} axis and so travels through a field with greater strength. This indirectness leads {{to the fact that the}} resulting refractive power is the square of the refractive power of a single lens.|$|E
50|$|For proper {{functioning}} of the electron gun, {{it is necessary that}} the beam be perfectly adjusted with respect to the optical axes of the accelerating electrical lens and the magnetic <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This can be done by applying a magnetic field of some specific radial direction and strength perpendicular to the optical axis before the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This is usually realized by a simple correction system consisting of two pairs of coils. By adjusting the currents in these coils any required correcting field can be produced.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (typically {{less than}} 10 cm in in diameter) {{is much smaller}} than the transparency, a crucial role is played by the optical {{condenser}} which illuminates the transparency. Since this requires a large optical lens (at least the size of the transparency) but may be of poor optical quality (since the sharpness of the image does not depend on it), a Fresnel lens is employed. The Fresnel lens is located at (or is part of) the glass plate on which the transparency is placed, and serves to redirect most of the light hitting it into a converging cone toward the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> Without such a condenser at that point, most of the light would miss the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (or {{it would have to be}} very large and prohibitively expensive). Additionally, mirrors or other condensing elements below the Fresnel lens serve to increase the portion of the light bulb's output which reaches the Fresnel lens in the first place. In order to provide sufficient light on the screen, a high intensity bulb is used which must be fan cooled.|$|E
50|$|The {{electron}} gun also needs low-voltage {{supplies for the}} correction system, the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens,</b> and the deflection system. The last mentioned may be very complex {{if it is to}} provide computer-controlled imaging, engraving, or similar beam applications.|$|E

50|$|An {{internal}} <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> (sometimes {{known as}} IF) is a photographic lens design in which focus is shifted {{by moving the}} inner lens group or groups only, without any rotation or shifting of the front lens element.
