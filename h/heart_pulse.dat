More recent devices utilise optics to measure heart rate using Infrared light. This is achieved by production of infrared light by an internal bulb, as Infrared light is absorbed by the blood, a sensor measures the amount that the infrared light is darkened by.

By the simultaneous use of different measurement methods, the propagation of pressure waves generated by each <b>heart</b> <b>pulse</b> can be sensed extensively in different areas of the human body and at different depths, for example, on the chest and forehead and at the fingertip. An accurate determination of a pulse wave allows calculating the pulse transit time (PTT) of a particular <b>heart</b> <b>pulse</b> {{in different parts of the}} human body. This result can then be used to estimate the pulse wave velocity of blood flow in different places. Both measurement methods are realized using magnetic resonance-compatible fibres, which makes the methods applicable to the MRI environment. One of the developed sensors is an extraordinary accelerometer sensor, while the other one is a more common sensor based on photoplethysmography.

Hemodialysis treatment handles a very delicate system {{which is why it}} is of the utmost importance that the dialysis machine has got a reliable safety monitoring system that can detect severe complications during treatment. A new such system is currently under development at Gambro, Lund, which focuses on early detection of venous needle dislodgement (VND). The safety monitoring system determines the <b>heart</b> <b>pulses</b> from the patient on both the venous and arterial side.

The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the current control system which is a hardware motor speed controller connected in cascade with a software blood flow controller.

Regarding the height of Shahrekord from the sea surface (2061 m) and low level of oxygen pressure in this area (600 mg), this study was aimed to determine the onset of desaturation of oxygen following, using of three pre-oxygenation methods in apnostic adult healthy patients. Methods: In this clinical single blind study, sixty-six healthy, non-smoker adults undergoing elective surgery were randomly divided into three groups. Following the record of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and <b>heart</b> <b>pulse</b> from the patients, group one were not pre-oxygenated, groups two and three were pre-oxygenated with 50 % oxygen and nitrous oxide and 100 % oxygen, respectively for three minutes. After induction of the same anesthesia in the 3 groups, the patients were kept in apnostic until their saturated pressure O 2 (SpO 2) decreased to 91 %. Subsequently, their systolic and diastolic blood pressure and <b>heart</b> <b>pulse</b> required to achieve SpO 2 of 91 % were measured. The data were analyzed using Chi-square and ANOVA tests. Results: Mean age of the patients was 30. 5 ± 14. 1 in whom 58 % of them were male. All of the three groups were sex and age matched (p> 0. 05). The delay time to achieve SpO 2 in group one, group two and group three were 44 ± 16, 114. 3 ± 36. 8 and 241. 6 ± 84, respectively (p< 0. 001). In all of the 3 groups, the increasing of <b>heart</b> <b>pulse</b> after the intervention was significantly different compared to before that (p< 0. 001).

This work presents a novel easy-to-use system intended for the fast and non invasive monitoring of the Lead I electrocardiogram (ECG) signal by using a wireless steering wheel. The steering wheel used here is a prototype model. A novel heart rate detection algorithm based on the continuous wavelet transform has been implemented, which is specially designed to be robust against the most common sources of noise and interference present when acquiring the ECG in the hands. Skin Electrodes were used to record the nerve voltages for monitoring the <b>heart</b> <b>pulse.</b> The voltages recorded {{will be sent to}} an instrumentation amplifier which amplifies the signal, and then to a filter which filters the noise. Thus, analog signal is given to Analog-to-Digital Convertor (ADC) of Arduino. There, analog voltages are been converted to digital and that digital values will be stored in the EEPROM of Arduino. The values stored in EEPROM will be sent to PC via XBEE (IEEE 802. 15. 4) wirelessly and a serial port will be opened in the MATLAB by using a serial object.
