Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with 1,600lbf (7.1kN) of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used to resolve problems with control surface clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by 19in (48cm). The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.|$|E

Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed GM 6L80-E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the old four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a <b>flush-fitting</b> hand brake lever to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).|$|E
2500|$|Construction on K5054 {{started in}} December 1934, {{although}} several modifications {{were to be}} incorporated into the prototype as construction continued. The most obvious change was to the Merlin engine's cooling system, which was now to use pure ethylene glycol rather than water, and the incorporation of a ducted radiator designed using the results of research conducted by Frederick Meredith of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. At the time of her first flight on 5 March 1936, K5054 was unpainted and the undercarriage had no fairings fitted and was fixed down. The first engine was a prototype Merlin C engine of 990hp (738kW), with six <b>flush-fitting</b> exhaust ports each side, driving an Aero-Products [...] "Watts" [...] two-bladed, wooden fixed-pitch propeller. The carburettor air intake was shorter and flatter than that of the Mk Is, and was recessed into the centre-section.|$|E
50|$|This {{modification}} {{is seldom}} {{carried out on}} late models, as newer cars have <b>flush-fitting</b> headlights. This is a styling cue both influenced by customising and a means of improving the aerodynamics of the car.|$|E

50|$|The wide (53 inches) rear seating {{was given}} extra knee-room by {{recesses}} in {{the backs of}} the front seats. Luxury rear standard fittings included folding tables. Draught free ventilation came from swivelling quarter-lights. There were independent bucket seats in front with a settee type available if requested. Both seating and pedals were adjustable. The driver's steering column was telescopic. A <b>flush-fitting</b> sliding roof was provided. The Lucas mellotone wind-horns adjusted for town or country. The luxurious upholstery was unpleated.|$|E

5000|$|The Mazda 626 badge {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} some markets, {{replacing}} the earlier [...] "616". The 626 was typically fitted with the 1.6- or 2.0-liter version of the Mazda F/MA, which produced from [...] The 626 was facelifted in November 1980, with the update bringing <b>flush-fitting</b> headlamps and a new grille insert. Other changes included redesigned tail-lights, a revised dash, new trim and improved dynamics. The grille was lengthened slightly to remove the body-colored gap between the headlamps and grille on the original model. It was also reduced in height so that the grille and headlamps formed a single [...] "band" [...] across the front-end.|$|E
5000|$|The first styling change came in August 1934 with {{a change}} to the {{radiator}} when the plated surround or cowl was replaced by one painted in body colour and it was given a slight slope. Synchromesh was added to second gear and dual screenwipers, <b>flush-fitting</b> self-cancelling trafficators (worked by the steering) and a foot-operated headlamp dip switch were fitted. The engine controls were simplified by the adoption of automatic ignition, compensated voltage control, {{and the provision of}} a [...] "choke" [...] (combined strangler and throttle control). The saloon was given the name Lichfield and got a protruding boot which enclosed the spare wheel. During 1935 the friction dampers were replaced with hydraulic dampers.|$|E
50|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Lincoln Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year. The body was fitted with <b>flush-fitting</b> front and rear bumpers and revised taillamps. While not fitted with the composite headlights of the Mark VII, the front fascia of the Continental was revised with an angled grille flanked by recessed quad headlamps and larger wrap-around marker lights incorporating cornering lamps. On the inside, the doors and dashboard were fitted with satin-black trim (accented with low-gloss genuine walnut veneer for the 1986 model year only). Other changes through the rest of production run were primarily limited to paint colors and upholstery pattern details. All models were also fitted with Ford's door-mounted Keyless Entry System, {{not to be confused with}} a Remote Keyless Entry System.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]22 LR 96/22 feeds {{from the}} same {{magazines}} as the popular Ruger 10/22 series. From the factory, it comes with the standard <b>flush-fitting</b> 10-round rotary magazine. Since it shares the magazine with the 10/22, the capacities available for the 96/22 include 10, 25, 50, etc. It utilizes the same v-block and barrels from the late model v-block style Ruger 77/22. Because of this, with an allen wrench, the owner can replace the barrel with a 77/22 barrel. To use a 10/22 barrel, the process {{is the same as}} converting a 10/22 barrel for use in a 77/22. Both the 77/22 and 96/22 have dual, opposed extractors. A slot for the left side extractor must be cut into a 10/22 barrel to use it in a 96/22 or 77/22.|$|E
50|$|Production Phantoms {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} design improvements. These included provisions for a <b>flush-fitting</b> centerline drop tank, an improved gunsight, {{and the addition of}} speed brakes. Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with 1,600 lbf (7.1 kN) of thrust per engine, developed with co-operation with the UKs Metropolitan Vickers (Metrovic) British Westinghouse. The J30 was a scaled down version of the Metrovick F2 Beryl, the UK's first axial flow jet engine.The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used to resolve problems with control surface clearance discovered during test flights.

5000|$|The Sea Vixen had {{a crew of}} two, a {{pilot and}} an {{observer}} to operate the radar. The pilot's canopy was offset to the left-hand side of the fuselage, while the observer was housed to the right completely within the fuselage, the latter gaining access to his position through a <b>flush-fitting</b> top hatch, nicknamed the [...] "Coal Hole". The observer's position was darkened and located deeper down into the fuselage, the former quality been seen to improve the visibility of the radar imagery. Both positions were fitted with fully automated height adjustable Martin-Baker Mk.4 ejector seats, which were capable of being deployed under a range of conditions and circumstances, including the aircraft being submerged in water. Each crew member had a single centralised service connector comprising circuits that served ventilated g-suits as well as controls for humidity and temperature for crew comfort.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{included some}} unique {{features such as}} the air conditioning vents which are <b>flush-fitting</b> in the dash, rotating open once the engine is started, and a rotating gearshift dial called the JaguarDrive Selector which rises out of the centre console. Another departure from the traditional Jaguar cabin ambiance {{is the use of}} pale-blue backlighting to the instruments, switchgear, and around major control panels. Some minor systems, such as the interior lighting, are controlled simply by touching the light covers. The glove compartment also opens to the touch. Unusually the XF has no cloth interior option, with even the entry level model being fully trimmed in leather - even areas that have employed plastic on previous Jaguars. Real wood veneers are available, but have been joined by aluminium, carbon fibre and piano black lacquer trims to create a modern look to the passenger compartment.|$|E
50|$|The He 176 {{was built}} to utilise {{one of the new}} Walter engines. It was a tiny, simple aircraft, built almost entirely out of wood, but did possess an advanced, totally {{enclosed}} cockpit, with a frameless single-piece clear nose, through which the pilot's rudder pedal mounts were visible, and a flush upper cockpit glazing which was removable for entering the aircraft, making the cockpit fit completely within the forward, bullet-like contours of the fuselage. The landing gear was a combination of conventional and tricycle gear designs, with the main gear's struts intended to retract rearwards into the fuselage, with a fixed, aerodynamically faired nose wheel and strut, and a retractable tail wheel. A unique feature of the He 176 was its jettisonable nose escape system. Compressed air was used to separate the nose from the aircraft. A drogue chute was used to reduce the opening force required. After the drogue was deployed, the <b>flush-fitting</b> cockpit canopy was released and a conventional pilot/parachute bailout occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The 1967 {{design was}} radically {{different}} from what came before. Ford's stylists delivered a radical shape {{that in many ways}} anticipated the styling trends of the next five years. A gaping wide [...] "fishmouth" [...] front grille that incorporated hidden headlights was the most obvious new feature. The look was clearly influenced by the intakes on jet fighters such as the F-100 Super Sabre, and was enhanced by the <b>flush-fitting</b> front bumper incorporating the bottom [...] "lip" [...] of the [...] "mouth". The sides were the barrel-like [...] "fuselage" [...] style that was very popular during this period. The belt line kicked up [...] "coke-bottle" [...] style after the rear windows, again a styling trait that would prove ubiquitous. Large C-pillars (and a small [...] "formal" [...] rear window on the 4-door) meant poor rear visibility but were the fashion of the time. The taillights spanned the full width of the car, and featured, as in previous Thunderbird models, sequential turn signals.|$|E
5000|$|The E2-1000 series {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} design improvements compared with the earlier batches, the most noticeable {{of which is the}} change from small windows for each seating bay to wide windows similar to the E4 series trains. A new single-arm pantograph design is used with an aerofoil-shaped mounting that eliminates the need for pantograph shrouds. The pre-series set, J51, was equipped with automatic couplers at both ends, but sets J52 onwards have couplers at the northern end only, as on the earlier E2' trains. Unlike the earlier J sets, these units are only compatible with the 50 Hz power supply of the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen routes. The <b>flush-fitting</b> plug doors of the earlier N and J sets were replaced by conventional sliding doors on these units. While J51 was delivered in the same livery as earlier E2 series trains, units J52 onward were delivered from new in the Hayate livery with a magenta waistline stripe in place of the previous red and a new [...] "apple" [...] logo in place of the [...] "wind" [...] logo on the original batch of J and N units.|$|E

50|$|For 1986, {{few changes}} marked the new DeVille's {{second year in}} production. An {{anti-lock}} braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard space-saver spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new <b>flush-fitting</b> center caps (last year's design featured exposed capped lugs), and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look {{was applied to the}} seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to the {{adoption}} of short-term planning cycles and the requirement for lowest initial construction costs, the conventional method for utility installation and maintenance in the UK is via open-cut. When taking a long-term sustainability perspective there is a growing body of evidence which indicates that this method is socially disruptive, environmentally damaging and significantly more expensive, i. e. unsustainable. One long-term solution to this problem could be {{the adoption}} of Multi-Utility Tunnels (MUTs); a tunnel that co-locates more than one utility underground facilitating their subsequent repair and renewal while eliminating the need for continuous surface excavation. Unfortunately considerably higher short-term direct costs remain a significant barrier to adoption of MUTs. However, {{there is a lack of}} research to show where the economic tipping point between the two methods occurs and how it might be influenced by utility type, pipe number (i. e. density), pipe diameter, number of excavation and reinstatement (E&R) procedures avoided, location (i. e. undeveloped, suburban and urban areas), and the choice of MUT being adopted (i. e. <b>flush-fitting,</b> shallow and deep). This paper aims to fulfil this research need by investigating the effect of these influences on the economic viability of various types of MUTs. The results indicate that MUTs can provide a more economically sustainable method of utility placement in all three local contexts, with the tipping points occurring where street works are likely more frequent and/or where utility density is high...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis proposes a new,novel evaluation ‘framework’ and accompanying operational ‘model’, the ‘SUURE’ (Sustainable Underground Use Resilience Evaluation) ‘framework’, which adopts a socio-ecological systems (SES) approach to evaluation, combining sustainability science and resilience theory, {{at the same time}} incorporating a range of interdisciplinary tools and methods to achieve this. It purposes at its core to aid in sustainability evaluation of urban underground space, by evaluating the process to the outcome of sustainable solutions i. e. the capacity to adapt to change in different steady states. In consequence, a fundamentally different approach to planning that utilises future socio-ecological scenarios (NSP, PR, MF and FW) is incorporated in the ‘framework’ as a means of evaluating through its operational ‘model’, the sensitivity of investment decisions made today in the name of sustainability i. e. will the proposed engineering sustainability solution continue to deliver its intended function into the future, whatever that may be. The SUURE operational ‘model’ was employed as a proof of concept to the case study area of Birmingham Eastside, evaluating the potential use of multi-utility tunnels (MUT) in Eastside as a means of engendering sustainable and resilient use of urban underground space, through sustainable utility placement, both now and into the future. The <b>flush-fitting</b> MUT was found to be having the highest overall baseline (present-day) performance resilience index ratio at mean of 0. 739, the shallow MUT second at 0. 656, and the deep MUT last at 0. 212. With regard to the evaluation of continued MUT functional performance into the future (whatever that may be), all three MUT options, if implemented today in the name of sustainability, would continue to deliver and retain their core functional performance, the deep MUT showing the most significant increase across all evaluation clusters (social, economic, physical, bio-physical and location aspects) ...|$|E
