40|$|When {{we speak}} generically about {{geothermal}} resources, {{what we are}} usually referring to is what should more accurately be called the accessible resource base; that is, all of the thermal energy stored between the EarthÕs surface and a specified depth in the crust, beneath a specified area and measured from local mean annual temperature (Muffler and Cataldi, 1978). The accessible resource base includes the useful accessible resource base (= Resource) Ð {{that part of the}} accessible resource base that could be extracted economically and legally at some specified time in the future (less than a hundred years). This category includes the <b>identified</b> <b>economic</b> <b>resource</b> (= Reserve) Ð that part of the resources of a given area that can be extracted legally at a cost competitive with other commercial energy sources and that are known and characterized by drilling or by geochemical, geophysical and geological evidence. Figure 1 illustrates in graphic form these and other terms that may be used by geothermal specialists. Geothermal Potential Different authors have performed different estimation of the geothermal potential, both for electricity generation and the direct uses. The IGA is making a compilation of all the existing data, in order to establish a Òconfidence intervalÓ of the minumum-maximum expected potential for the geothermal exploitation...|$|E

Henry Villard, president of the Northern Pacific Railroad, had invited Pumpelly to map the sprawling areas of Washington, Idaho, and Montana and to <b>identify</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> near the railroad lines. Pumpelly published part of that survey in his report for the Tenth Census, including at least one of Wilson's maps.|$|R
5000|$|Underground mining {{ended in}} 1952, {{but not because}} the mine {{had run out of}} gold; current {{operation}} is evidence of this. Rather, a series of factors led to a decline in production. Chief among those was the international gold price, which was fixed at $US35 an ounce, limiting the revenue the mine could make. Other factors included the need for a substantial capital expenditure to update the machinery. Although the technology was available to do this, the money was not. Manpower issues also factored into the decision to close the underground mine. There had been two World Wars and the Depression of the 1930s, depleting manpower and creating a difficult economic climate. [...] It was not possible, given these factors, to profitably mine the lower grade ore. In the 1970s and early 1980s the gold price increased. Exploration and prospecting work <b>identified</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>resource</b> that could be profitably exploited through a lower cost open pit approach. The mine was reopened, and continues in production today.In April 2015 and April 2016, large landslides occurred and stopped mining activities. Geological studies are carried out to find out, whether the mining can continue.|$|R

40|$|After the 2000 ‘Water-War’, {{access to}} water in Bolivia {{has become a major}} social demand and thus a prime and {{contentious}} political issue. The event has revealed an overwhelming opposition to neo-liberal approaches to water management and has allowed the articulation of a new discourse that sees water not as an <b>economic</b> <b>resource</b> but as a human right. In this context, the paper reviews the two contrasting positions within the debate about whether or not water should be treated as an <b>economic</b> <b>resource.</b> In doing so, it presents the arguments underpinning each position which then allows it to elaborate some relevant conclusions.

40|$|An {{influential}} hypothesis {{in family}} research is that having many <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> decreases women’s and increases men’s rate of entering a union. A more recent {{hypothesis is that}} {{the strength of the}} association between <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> and union formation has weakened over time, given decreasing role differentiation by gender. Rather than looking at the timing of union formation, we look at its non-occurrence. Using the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, we find that, as predicted, high-resource women and low-resource men are more likely to remain single. Contrary to predictions, university-educated men {{are also more likely to}} remain single. The association between <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> and permanent singlehood shows little change over time. Several explanations for this unexpected finding are discussed. ...|$|R
