5|$|C. Ángel Nieto and Jan <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> {{finished}} the 1972 championship tied on 69 points. Nieto and <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> had both won three Grands Prix and finished second three times. As a result, the championship was decided by adding up their times {{from the five}} races that the two had finished together. Nieto was declared the winner by 21.5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime {{reporter}} Peter R. <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> {{claimed that}} he had solved the Holloway case. <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3. On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that {{he was telling the}} individual what he wanted to hear, and that he had no role in her disappearance. That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.|$|E
5|$|Further {{additions}} to the interior were made over the next quarter-century. A new Gothic altar, produced in Düsseldorf, Germany, was installed in 1880. Two years later a communion bench was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the clock was removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus {{he spent much of}} his time away from the church. By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo joined Leicester City in April 2005 {{after leaving}} Hearts, signing a {{pre-contract}} agreement in January. He followed former Hearts boss Craig Levein, teammates Mark <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> and Alan Maybury {{across the border}} to the Midlands club.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with <b>de</b> <b>Vries.</b> In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after five}} films, Sean Connery {{resigned}} from the role of James Bond and—during the filming of You Only Live Twice—was not on speaking terms with Albert Broccoli.

5|$|In the United States, cultivars are {{propagated}} {{in large}} numbers for sale before Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in November). In Europe, plants are mainly sold later in the year, in the period before Christmas. A single Dutch grower (<b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> of Aalsmeer, the Netherlands) was reported in 1989 as producing 2,000,000 plants per year.|$|E
5|$|Joanna and Elvis {{follow the}} conspirators {{to the ancient}} {{spacecraft}} and eventually find a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll cracking the weapon. Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original, and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon to self-destruct. In retaliation for ruining their plans, the Skedar launch a strike on the Carrington Institute, capturing Joanna and taking her to their homeworld. While in their spaceship, she is met by <b>De</b> <b>Vries,</b> who has also been imprisoned due to her failure {{to comply with the}} deal. Feeling that she has been used, <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself, freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge. Joanna is later assisted by Elvis and the pair manage to land on the Skedar planet. There, she defeats the Skedar High Priest, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September 2008, in New York City, <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> {{accepted}} an International Emmy Award in Current Affairs for his coverage while accompanied by Beth Holloway. Under {{pressure of the}} attention from the program, Van der Sloot voluntarily checked into a psychiatric clinic before departing for Thailand. He moved to Muang Ake, a suburb of Bangkok, to study business at Rangsit University, but dropped out and bought Sawadee Cup, a restaurant next to the campus that served sandwiches and pizza.|$|E
5|$|Saltationism was {{the idea}} that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo <b>de</b> <b>Vries,</b> William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E
5|$|Hugo <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|Zagreb {{was one of}} {{the first}} European cities where {{television}} pictures were broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the Zagreb Fair featured a Philips television system, operated for short periods each day of the exhibition (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by Eric Klaas <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London and Berlin. The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|J. Keijzer {{replaced}} <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> {{after the}} latter's death in 1887 and headed {{the church for}} seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly. Construction of a multi-story presbytery began in the 1880s and completed on 1 August 1890. Across the street, in 1888 the nuns established an elementary school, and they also began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{is set in}} 2023 {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble the archetypal grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans, bearing similarities to Nordic aliens. Using this disguise, they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar: in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried on the ocean floor, the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Villani's Cronica {{is divided}} into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally Biblical times to 1264. The second phase, in six books, covers the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up}} to 1346. Villani outlines the events in his Cronica, not by theme, but through year-to-year accounts; for this, he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. Villani's chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, with little interpretation; this often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, making most of his mistakes in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs). However, his description of such events as the Battle of Crécy in 1346 was fairly accurate according to historian Kelly <b>De</b> <b>Vries.</b> Both Bartlett and Green state that Villani's Cronica represented a departure from medieval chronicles in that a more modernistic approach was taken in describing events and statistics, yet still medieval in that Villani relied on divine providence to explain the outcome of events.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch central {{division}} {{joined the}} battle {{at the head}} of the line shortly after the engagement of Triumph and Bedford, causing considerable damage to all of the British vessels, particularly Venerable. The British flagship was soon isolated in the midst of the Dutch van, engaging Vrijheid, Staaten General, Admiral Tjerk Hiddes <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> and Wassenaar simultaneously. Despite the heavy odds Duncan continued to fight hard, the British succeeded in knocking out two opponents by wounding Captain Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt of Beschermer, which drifted eastwards in confusion, while shots from either Bedford or Triumph set a powder barrel on Hercules on fire. The blaze on the latter ship, which soon spread to the sails and rigging, prompted a lull in the battle as the crew of Hercules desperately attempted to extinguish the blaze and other Dutch ships scrambled to escape the burning vessel as it drifted through the melee. Shortly afterwards, the battered Wassenaar surrendered to Triumph, with Captain Holland dead on his quarterdeck. Triumph then moved on towards the battle between Vrijheid and Venerable, at which time the crew of Wassenaar raised their colours again after being fired on by a Dutch brig.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E

25|$|Sussex County was {{the site}} of the first European {{settlement}} in Delaware, a Dutch trading post named Zwaanendael at the present site of Lewes. On June 3, 1631, Dutch captain David Pietersen <b>de</b> <b>Vries</b> landed along the shores of the Delaware to establish a whaling colony in the mid-Atlantic of the New World. The colony lasted only until 1632, when <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> left. Upon returning to Zwaanendael that December, he found the Indian tribes had killed his men and burned the colony. The Dutch set about settling the area once again.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} said to have evolved {{suddenly}} from single mutations without transitional species. The theory originated with Dutch botanist Hugo <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> but was short-lived and is not now supported.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 three scientists, Carl Correns, Erich von Tschermak and Hugo <b>De</b> <b>Vries,</b> had rediscovered {{the work}} of Gregor Mendel, {{and with it the}} {{foundation}} of genetics. <b>De</b> <b>Vries</b> proposed that new species were created by mutation, bypassing the need for either Lamarckism or Darwinism. As Morgan had dismissed both evolutionary theories, he was seeking to prove De Vries' mutation theory with his experimental heredity work. He was initially skeptical of Mendel's laws of heredity (as well as the related chromosomal theory of sex determination), which were being considered as a possible basis for natural selection.|$|E
