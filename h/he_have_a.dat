5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} {{that in order}} to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

500|$|Naruto author Masashi Kishimoto created Gaara as a foil to the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki.

Gaara's development from this state into a highly withdrawn, sadistic character was intended to induce sympathy for him from readers, as it was contrasted against Naruto's development into a cheerful troublemaker. Additionally, his design was designed to look like the Tanuki since Kishimoto thought that it would make him a good rival for Naruto's Nine-Tailed Demon Fox since several parts from the Shukaku were considered by Kishimoto to be opposite ones from the Demon Fox.|$|E
500|$|Mölders' {{supporters}} {{challenged the}} ruling, {{and pointed out}} that Mölders had been posted to Spain well after the bombing of Guernica. They pointed to his equivocal political attitude towards National Socialism and his unequivocal moral commitment to Catholicism.

Despite petitions from politicians and high-ranking active and retired servicemen, among them Horst Seehofer, Günther Rall and Jörg Kuebart, the Office for Military History (MGFA) noted that Mölders' membership in the Bund Neudeutschland did not provide sufficient evidence of his having {{been critical of the}} regime, but rather showed the contrary and [...] concluded that it was questionable whether Mölders had distanced himself enough from National Socialism before his death in 1941. [...] Consequently, the decision remained in force.|$|E

500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise.|$|E

The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls. When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away. Moore yelled to the band, [...] "Take the New York Stock Exchange!" [...] In an interview with the Socialist Worker, Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange. [...] "About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors came crashing down." [...] "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. [...] "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".|$|E

2500|$|Among Canadians, Alexander {{proved to}} be a popular viceroy, despite the calls for a Canadian-born {{governor}} general that had preceded his appointment. Not only did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much praised military reputation—he was considered to be the best military strategist since the 1st Duke of Wellington—but he was also a charismatic figure with an easy ability to communicate with people. Others, however, did not fully approve of Alexander; editor Hugh Templin, from Fergus, Ontario, met with Alexander during Templin's time as a special correspondent with the Canadian Press during the Second World War, and he said of the encounter: [...] "Lord Alexander impressed us considerably, if not too favourably. He was an aristocratic type, who didn't like newspaper men." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cloak: {{two types}} of cloaks were used, the sagum and the paenula. Both were made from wool, which {{insulated}} and also contained natural oil to repel water. They were fastened with a fibula. The paenula was hooded in colder climates. Since every common soldier slept in the open, {{it was important that}} <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> warm full-length wrap, but necessary that he carry it with him each day regardless of his activities. [...] This was accomplished by a cloak of more than body length, double-folded so that it did not fall beneath the knees when worn.

He did not have a sample of the baby's DNA to analyze against, nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> court order to submit to testing, but had stated {{that he wanted to be}} prepared if his paternity case had continued.

Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. [...] During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. [...] Patinkin was replaced by future Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello. New York Times critic Frank Rich stated: [...] "Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role {{better than any of}} the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: not only does <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He's so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there's a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga."

2500|$|Ibn Taymiyyah had {{a simple}} life, {{most of which}} he {{dedicated}} to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> female companion, throughout his years. Al-Matroudi says {{that this may be}} why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge. An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted. His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist. In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six different occasions with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years. Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison. His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues. However according to Yahya Michot, [...] "the real reasons were more trivial". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the [...] "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues." [...] Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard divinity school says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, [...] "as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration." ...|$|E
