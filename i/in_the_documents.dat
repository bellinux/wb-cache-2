5|$|Cardinals who {{simultaneously}} {{were also}} bishops usually appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal. The only exceptions are archbishop Uberto Crivelli of Milan, who subscribed papal bulls only as cardinal, and Ruggiero of Benevento, who generally was styled only as archbishop, while his cardinalate was mentioned very infrequently.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents.</b> Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|France did {{not abandon}} its claims to Texas until November 3, 1762, when it ceded {{all of its}} {{territory}} west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, following its defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War. It ceded New France to Britain. In 1803, three years after Spain had returned Louisiana to France, Napoleon sold the territory to the United States. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> were ambiguous and contradictory. The United States insisted that its purchase included all of the territory France had claimed, including all of Texas. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, in which Spain ceded Florida to the United States {{in return for the}} United States' relinquishing its claim on Texas.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that {{there was no need to}} move the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had been recommended by some Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of {{the entrance to the}} Duomo of Salò is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's hand is evident in the figures of the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the spandrels appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal was put in place by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{the written}} use of Castilian in Galicia was common since 1400, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> {{issued by the}} offices of foreigners {{established}} in the country, since 1500 the open substitution of Galician elites by Castilian officials led to the progressive discrimination of Galician language and even of Galician people, although public inscriptions in tombstones and foundations were still common {{during much of the}} 16th century. These developments led to the apparition of a series of literary and historical works which goal was the vindication of Galician history, language, people and culture, most notably during the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not widely}} known, in the Soviet era, Marshak {{was on a}} (political) razor's edge and barely escaped death in 1937.

25|$|After the Civil War {{and during}} Reconstruction, Johns Hopkins' stance on abolitionism infuriated many {{prominent}} people in Baltimore. During the American Reconstruction period {{to his death}} his abolitionism was expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> founding the Johns Hopkins Institutions, and reported in newspaper articles before, during, and after the founding of these institutions. Before the war, there was significant written opposition to his support for Myrtilla Miner's founding of a school for African American females (now the University of the District of Columbia). Similarly, opposition (and some support) was expressed during Reconstruction, such as in 1867, the same year he filed papers incorporating the Johns Hopkins Institutions, when he attempted unsuccessfully to stop the convening of the Maryland Constitutional Convention where the Democratic Party came into power and where a new state Constitution, the Constitution still in effect, was voted to replace the 1864 Constitution of the Radical Republicans previously in power.|$|E
25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff.

Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest {{he knew what was}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time.
