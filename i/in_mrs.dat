40|$|The {{clinical}} use of in vivo {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) has been limited for a long time, mainly due to its low sensitivity. However, {{with the advent of}} clinical MR systems with higher magnetic field strengths such as 3 Tesla, the development of better coils, and the design of optimized radio-frequency pulses, sensitivity has been considerably improved. Therefore, <b>in</b> vivo <b>MRS</b> has become a technique that is routinely used more and more in the clinic. In this review, the basic methodology of <b>in</b> vivo <b>MRS</b> is described-mainly focused on (1) H MRS of the brain-with attention to hardware requirements, patient safety, acquisition methods, data post-processing, and quantification. Furthermore, examples of clinical applications of <b>in</b> vivo brain <b>MRS</b> <b>in</b> two interesting fields are described. First, together with a description of the major resonances present in brain MR spectra, several examples are presented of deviations from the normal spectral pattern associated with inborn errors of metabolism.

5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner <b>in</b> <b>Mrs</b> Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Our aim was {{to confirm}} the {{clinical}} relationship between the Kurashiki Prehospital Stroke Scale (KPSS) scored by paramedics and favorable outcomes in patients with modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 0 – 1 assessed 3 months after symptom onset. Methods: We enrolled patients with acute stroke and transient ischemic attack showing symptoms on admission. Paramedics transferred patients to our hospital after estimating stroke severity using the KPSS. After categorizing patients into either the mRS 0 – 1 group (favorable outcome) or the mRS 2 – 6 group (no favorable outcome), we compared the background data between the two groups. We assessed KPSS scores predictive of a favorable outcome. Multivariate regression modeling was conducted to identify factors independently associated with a favorable outcome. Results: The study cohort comprised 147 patients with a premorbid status of mRS 0 – 1 : 69 patients (47 %) of them were <b>in</b> the <b>mRS</b> 0 – 1 group and 78 (53 %) <b>in</b> the <b>mRS</b> 2 – 6 group at the follow-up 3 months after symptom onset.

40|$|Cerebral {{ischemia}} {{contributes to}} cerebral damage in hydrocephalus. Many {{studies have reported}} changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism, supporting this hypothesis. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) enables us to investigate cerebral metabolism in a non-invasive and longitudinal manner, thereby providing a promising way of evaluating pathophysiological changes in experimental and clinical hydrocephalus. In this review, the potential of 1 H (proton) and 31 P (phosphorus) <b>MRS</b> <b>in</b> the assessment of cerebral metabolism will be summarized, and a synopsis of in vitro and <b>in</b> vivo <b>MRS</b> studies <b>in</b> experimental and human hydrocephalus will be presented. Changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism, intracellular pH and lactate production <b>in</b> several <b>MRS</b> studies are presumed to reflect cerebral ischemia. In vivo information on neuronal damage, maturational delay and membrane phospholipid metabolism may also be derived from 1 H and 31 P MRS data. Technical, methodological and pathophysiological considerations, which are important for a correct interpretation and comparison of different MRS studies, will be discussed. Finally, we will draw some conclusions on {{the significance of these}} MRS findings and the applicability of <b>MRS</b> <b>in</b> the diagnosis and evaluation of clinical hydrocephalu...|$|R
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner <b>in</b> <b>Mrs</b> Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London.
