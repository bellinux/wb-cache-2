500|$|A keen cyclist, in 2009 Everest {{collaborated with}} cyclewear brand Rapha {{to develop a}} bespoke suit that could be worn while cycling; what he called [...] "bespoke active wear". Priced at £3,500, the three-piece suit was made of blended wool, using {{nanotechnology}} to repel water and dirt. It combined the functionality of classic cycling clothing with the elegance of bespoke tailoring. Its features included a high button fastening to keep the jacket closely fitted to the body, a lapel pocket for an MP3 player and pleats at the shoulders and center back to allow extra fabric when the rider was bent over the bicycle. The jacket design was incorporated into Rapha's ready-to-wear collection in 2010. In collaboration with bicycle saddle manufacturer Brooks England during 2010, he developed a cycling jacket; under Brooks' John Boultbee clothing label. The resulting 'Criterion Mk.1 cycling jacket', which used water and sweat-resistant materials, was shown at the Bread and Butter street and urban <b>fashion</b> <b>fair,</b> Berlin, in January 2011.|$|E

6000|$|And, fair lady reader, let me {{hope you}} will say the same. You can do {{something}} for your country,--it lies right in your hand. Go to the shops, determined on supplying your family and yourself with American goods. Insist on having them; {{raise the question of}} origin over every article shown to you. In the Revolutionary times, some of the leading matrons of New England gave parties where the ladies were dressed in homespun and drank sage tea. Fashion makes all things beautiful, and you, my charming and accomplished friend, can create beauty by creating fashion. What makes the beauty of half the Cashmere shawls? Not anything in the shawls themselves, for they often look coarse and dingy and barbarous. It is the association with style and <b>fashion.</b> <b>Fair</b> lady, give style and fashion to the products of your own country,--resolve that the money in your hand shall go to your brave brothers, to your co-Americans, now straining every nerve to uphold the nation and cause it to stand high in the earth. What are you without your country? As Americans you can hope for no rank but the rank of your native land, no badge of nobility but her beautiful stars. It rests with this conflict to decide whether those stars shall be badges of nobility to you and your children in all lands. Women of America, your country expects every woman to do her duty! ...|$|E
