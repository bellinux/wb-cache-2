25|$|For {{the lower}} basses <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the {{shoulder}} {{at the start of}} the turn and lock the other direction on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum at the end of the turn and letting the momentum get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and back muscles).|$|E

[...] "When he has to wait to hit, I think <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> away from him." [...] But by early March, it was reported that he would bat fifth. Washington said, however, that that would not keep Kinsler from running: [...] "I will not slow him down. He is a threat. I will not take away that threat. I'm not stopping Kins." [...] On days when Julio Borbon was not batting leadoff, Kinsler was to move up to the top of the lineup. In the end, Kinsler started 60 games batting 3rd, 20 games batting 5th, 16 games batting 6th, and 6 games leading off.|$|E

500|$|The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, Spain {{stood in}} for the Tower of Joy in the {{flashback}} scene involving a young Ned Stark and Ser Arthur Dayne, as witnessed by Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven. During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You hope it is. Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to be reminded that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E
2500|$|The Coalition forces began {{constructing}} extensive siege works around Maubeuge. On {{the first}} day, the French garrison sortied against the Cense de Château but were repulsed after stiff fighting. Maubeuge was supplied for a normal garrison but {{far too many}} soldiers were trapped there. On 10 October, Ferrand had to put the troops on half-rations, while hundreds of sick and dying soldiers crowded the hospitals. On the 13 October, the French enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the Bois du Tilleul, but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the French were compelled to retreat. The Coalition established batteries of 20 24-pound cannons against the town. [...] After the Coalition army opened its bombardment {{on the night of}} 14 October, the morale of the garrison sank. When some soldiers complained to Chancel that they were hungry and tired he replied, [...] "Listen young men, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work and privation in order to gain the honor to fight and die for your country." [...] Representative Jean-Baptiste Drouet tried to cut his way out of Maubeuge with some dragoons but was captured. Denounced for abandoning the place, Drouet claimed his escape would have raised the spirits of the garrison.|$|E
