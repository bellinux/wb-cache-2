50|$|The Atlantic {{surf clam}} (Spisula solidissima), {{also called the}} bar clam, <b>hen</b> <b>clam,</b> skimmer, or simply sea clam, is a very large, edible, {{saltwater}} clam or marine bivalve mollusk in the family Mactridae. It is commonly found in the western Atlantic Ocean. Reaching up to 20 cm or more in length, it is {{much larger than the}} related surf clam, which resides in the eastern Atlantic waters off of Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|Although {{thermostable}} direct hemolysin (TDH) -producing Vibrio parahaemolyticus {{has caused}} many infections in Asian countries, the United States, and other countries, {{it has been}} difficult to detect the same pathogen in seafoods and other environmental samples. In this study, we detected and enumerated tdh gene-positive V. parahaemolyticus in Japanese seafoods with a tdh-specific PCR method, a chromogenic agar medium, and a most-probable-number method. The tdh gene was detected in 33 of 329 seafood samples (10. 0 %). The number of tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus ranged from < 3 to 93 / 10 g. The incidence of tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus tended to be high in samples contaminated with relatively high levels of total V. parahaemolyticus. TDH-producing strains of V. parahaemolyticus were isolated from 11 of 33 tdh-positive samples (short-necked clam, <b>hen</b> <b>clam,</b> and rock oyster). TDH-producing strains of V. parahaemolyticus were also isolated from the sediments of rivers near the coast in Japan. Representative strains of the seafood and sediment isolates were examined for the O:K serovar and by the PCR method specific to the pandemic clone and arbitrarily primed PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques. The results indicated that most O 3 :K 6 tdh-positive strains belonged to the pandemic O 3 :K 6 clone and suggested that serovariation took place in the Japanese environment...|$|E
5000|$|The many inlet coves {{around the}} island are home to {{abundant}} clam beds. During low tide, these fully exposed areas can be walked on and are often clammed by the locals, {{some of whom have}} made a living for decades harvesting steamers, <b>hen</b> <b>clams,</b> and razor clams from the muddy, clay-rich soil. Clamming is often shut down when the red tide [...] - [...] a harmful microscopic ocean organism that affects shellfish [...] - [...] "blooms" [...] in the area. People who eat clams that are affected by the red tide (even steamed ones) can become violently ill; the algae can be fatal. This paralytic poisoning often causes death to humans, birds, larval and adult fish, and marine mammals.|$|R
