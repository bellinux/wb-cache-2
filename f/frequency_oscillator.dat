25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> with a variable low <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator,</b> resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E
25|$|The timbre {{of musical}} {{instruments}} {{can be considered}} in the light of Fourier theory to consist of multiple harmonic or inharmonic partials or overtones. Each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time due to modulation from an ADSR envelope or low <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Tesla coil is a radio <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{that drives}} an air-core double-tuned {{resonant}} transformer to produce high voltages at low currents. Tesla's original circuits {{as well as}} most modern coils use a simple spark gap to excite oscillations in the tuned transformer. More sophisticated designs use transistor or thyristor switches or vacuum tube electronic oscillators to drive the resonant transformer.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthesizer}} has 10 simple preset voices {{combined with}} a manually editable section which can be manually tweaked around to create new interesting sounds. No user program memory is available. Its effects include white noise generator, portamento, octave transposition, two low <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> and a random note generator.|$|R
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator,</b> {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
5000|$|Low <b>Frequency</b> <b>Oscillators</b> (LFOs) - each voice {{can have}} up to five LFOs applied. Each LFO can have a {{different}} waveform: triangle, square, up-saw, down-saw, random or noise. Additionally, a sampling mode is provided, whereby an independent source (e.g. a different LFO) is sampled at a set frequency.|$|R

5000|$|The theremin {{uses the}} {{heterodyne}} principle to generate an audio signal. The instrument's pitch circuitry includes two radio <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> set below 500 kHz to minimize radio interference. One oscillator operates {{at a fixed}} frequency. The frequency of the other oscillator is almost identical, and {{is controlled by the}} performer's distance from the pitch control antenna.|$|R
2500|$|A low-frequency {{oscillator}} (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below ≈20Hz. [...] This term is typically {{used in the}} field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an audio <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Low <b>frequency</b> <b>{{oscillator}}</b> (LFO) – an oscillator of {{adjustable frequency}} {{that can be}} used to modulate the sound rhythmically, for example to create tremolo or vibrato or to control a filter's operating frequency. [...] LFOs are used in most forms of synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a beat <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to base band). For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted.|$|E
40|$|A nanomechanical {{resonator}} {{coupled to}} a tunnel junction is studied. The oscillator modulates {{the transmission of}} the junction, changing the current and the noise spectrum. The influence of the oscillator on the noise spectrum of the junction is investigated, and the noise spectrum is obtained for arbitrary frequencies, temperatures and bias voltages. We find that the noise spectrum consists of a noise floor and a peaked structure with peaks at zero <b>frequency,</b> the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> and twice the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency.</b> The influence of the oscillator vanishes if the bias voltage of the junction {{is lower than the}} <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency.</b> We demonstrate that the peak at the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> can be used to determine the oscillator occupation number, showing that the current noise in the junction functions as a thermometer for the oscillator.

There will also be an option to setup the parameters by typing a text string...|$|R
2500|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} or {{phase lock loop}} {{abbreviated}} as PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase {{is related to the}} phase of an input signal. [...] There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> and a phase detector in a feedback loop. [...] The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.|$|E
2500|$|Beat <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) - This is an {{electronic}} oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). [...] It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. [...] The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. [...] In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Packard and Hewlett {{established}} Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard's garage with {{an initial}} capital investment of $538 (...) [...] Packard mentions in his book The HP Way that the name Hewlett-Packard {{was determined by the}} flip of a coin: HP, rather than PH. Their first product was an audio <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> sold to Walt Disney Studios for use on the soundtrack of Fantasia. The HP Way describes HP's management philosophy, which encourages creativity and shuns traditional business hierarchy and formality. During World War II HP produced radio, sonar, radar, nautical, and aviation devices.|$|E

50|$|The 6AK5 {{was used}} in some types of radiosonde, (weather balloon payloads), in the 1960s and 70s. Because of the non-recoverable nature of the equipment, the single 6AK5 was {{soldered}} directly to the printed circuit board and served as the only active device in the circuit, performing the function of a low <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>oscillator</b> and the high <b>frequency</b> carrier <b>oscillator</b> and output stage.|$|R
50|$|A PLL {{includes}} a phase detector, filter and oscillator connected {{in a closed}} loop, so the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> follows (equals) the input frequency. Although the average output frequency equals the input <b>frequency,</b> the <b>oscillator's</b> <b>frequency</b> fluctuates or vibrates about that average value. The closed loop operates to correct such frequency deviations; higher performance PLL reduces these fluctuations to lower values, however these deviations can never be stopped. See Control theory. Phase noise, spurious emission, and jitter are results of the above phenomena.|$|R
2500|$|On reception, the FSK {{signal is}} {{converted}} to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or beat <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b> These tones are fed to the demodulator part of the modem, which processes them {{through a series of}} filters and detectors to recreate the original digital signal. The FSK signals are audible on a communications radio receiver equipped with a BFO, and have a distinctive [...] "beedle-eeeedle-eedle-eee" [...] sound, usually starting and ending on one of the two tones ("idle on mark").|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Ken Freeman {{demonstrated}} the first 'string machine' which was essentially combo-organ like {{in size and}} how it generated tones. [...] It had simple controls though centered around creating an ensemble effect where vibrato is happening at slightly different rates on different notes like in a real orchestra. [...] Ken used 6 discrete LFO's (low <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuits) to modulate atypically hit together note combinations (diminished fifth combinations like C and F). It had two 'ranks' of 12 oscillators plus a single oscillator driving a chip that develops the top octave of notes in the version that hit market in 1974. In November 1974 the British patent 1,509,530 lists an electronic digital musical arranger by Nicholas Kenneth Kirk. This patent was sold to Waddington' House of Games as Compute-a-Tune. This product was marketed in the early 1980s and sold a few thousand or so in the £15 range. The ARP Solina String Ensemble and Crumar Stringman used a much less expensive approach using digitally clocked chips called BBD's. [...] Only a few hundred were made.|$|E
50|$|The {{negative}} resistance oscillator model {{is not limited}} to one-port devices like diodes but can also be applied to feedback oscillator circuits with two port devices such as transistors and tubes. In addition, in modern high <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> transistors are increasingly used as one-port {{negative resistance}} devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port. So high <b>frequency</b> transistor <b>oscillators</b> are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.|$|R

5000|$|The {{negative}} resistance oscillator model {{is not limited}} to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with two-port amplifying devices such as transistors and tubes also have {{negative resistance}}.
