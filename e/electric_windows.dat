The 150PS (110kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> central locking, electronic antilock brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.|$|E

25|$|From launch, {{the car was}} {{available}} in base (Popular), L, GL, Ghia and XR3 trim. From mid-1982, a five-speed manual gearbox was introduced across the range. This was now standard on the 1.6L versions and could be specified as an option on most 1.3L engines. A selection of features were available, either as standard fitment or optional extras depending on model, including a tilt-and-slide sunroof, central locking, and <b>electric</b> <b>windows.</b> All models except for base and L were fitted with a check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads.

25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the <b>electric</b> <b>windows.</b> Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} {{was designed for}} two passengers and trimmed in leather.

[...] At the same time other detail improvements were made including a dash centre console, improved instrument illumination and the availability of front <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> {{for the first time on}} a Defender. The design faults of the two-piece rear 4x4 door were finally eradicated with a one-piece door featuring a rubber weather sealing strip for the rear window.|$|E
5000|$|Multipla ELX: added Air Conditioning, Twin Electric Sunroofs, alloy {{wheels and}} <b>electric</b> rear <b>windows,</b> {{as well as}} special wipe-clean, brightly {{coloured}} seats.|$|R

2500|$|Nissan {{sought to}} elevate {{the status of the}} DR30 Skyline as their new {{flagship}} model in light of this success, and it received a generous amount of changes to distinguish it from lesser Skyline models in August 1983. Interior equipment was significantly upgraded to now include <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> air conditioning and power steering as standard in the new RS-X model (for Extra) with an increased curb weight of around [...] it also included a driver's seat with multi-way power lumbar adjustment, anti-skid control, fog lamps, rear deck spoiler and other features such as dimmable instrument cluster lighting; gone were the days of the spartan, stripped-out race interior, although this could still be specified at time of purchase. But by far the most striking change to the RS was the new unique front end treatment, nicknamed Tekkamen (...) or Iron Mask by fans for its distinctive look. The headlights were considerably slimmer, and instead of a conventional grille the bonnet now sloped down to two narrow slits above a facelifted front bumper and airdam.|$|E
2500|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in four models; the L, the MT-5, the GL, and the LX. The L was the base model, with only {{the most basic of}} equipment. The MT-5 was the second model, which was aimed at Japanese imports, as it was only available with a 4-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission (hence the term MT-5). The value model was the GL, which contained more equipment than the MT-5 and L, and had such interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding rear armrest, <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and locks. The LX was the top of the line model, which had the most standard equipment, as well as many features that were unique to this model, such as cornering lamps and side body cladding, as well as its own unique seat design, automatic climate control, light packages, luggage convenience kit, electronic cluster with onboard system scanner and fuel computer, autolamps with timer, premium amplified stereo with 6 speakers [...] "Premium Sound", 6 way electric seats with inflatable lumbar support and other equipment options at an added price. The wagon was offered in the same trim levels in the same order.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|E
50|$|Hayes did {{not give}} up, however, and {{continued}} his passionate internal marketing of the project. As prototypes started to emerge, dealers were invited to test drive sessions, and this increased the enthusiasm for the new car. In addition, Ford took some radical measures to reduce the price on the car. As an example, the car was only offered in three exterior colours (black, white and moonstone blue) and one interior colour (grey). There were also just two equipment options: with or without central locking and <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts.|$|R
5000|$|As did all GM B-Body wagons, the Safari and Grand Safari {{received}} GM's new clamshell tailgate. Operated by {{switches on}} the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> slid upward into the rear roof section. Pontiac boasted the new system {{made it easier to}} load and unload the wagon in tight spaces, but the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] tailgate was prone to electrical and mechanical problems, and water and air leakage problems, as the cars aged.|$|R
25|$|In Romania, it was {{initially}} available with four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic level Ambiance featured driver airbag, body-colored bumpers, wheel trims and central locking. The second level Preference added passenger airbag, power steering, <b>electric</b> front <b>windows,</b> radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking. The third level Laureate added front fog lights, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat head restraints and a multi-adjustable driver seat. The top level Ambition also had ABS, <b>electric</b> rear <b>windows,</b> CD player and alloy wheels. The 1.6-litre gasoline engine was available {{only on the}} Preference level and above. In September 2005, the 1.5-litre diesel engine was introduced, initially not being available on the Ambition level. In January 2006, a new intermediate trim level called Laureate Plus was added, which {{in addition to the}} Laureate level featured ABS, <b>electric</b> rear <b>windows</b> and CD player. Also, the diesel engine became available for the Ambition level.|$|R
2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, but oh so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E

50|$|Like {{most of the}} Henry Huggins books, the {{incidents}} in this book follow an ongoing plot line. In it, the Hugginses have a new car, and go out shopping; Ribsy, denied a ride, chases it at up to 25 miles per hour, and is finally allowed in. At the mall, he is left in it, and lowers the <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> with the button. He eventually wants to return to await Henry, and gets into the first new-smelling car he finds.
