5|$|Allen {{retired from}} the Stock Exchange in 1972, {{resigned}} as MCC Treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982. He was appointed a CBE in 1962 and knighted in 1986. In 1968, Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord's, where he lived until his death. Following his retirement, {{he spent much of}} his time in the MCC Committee room, watching cricket at Lord's.

5|$|Allen {{was born}} with a {{deformed}} left arm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> a rare object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. His left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Infrared {{reflectivity}} {{measurements of}} GaN 1 -xPx alloys and quantitative fittings using Lorentz model {{have been carried}} out. In the GaN 1 -xPx alloys, two competitive mechanisms that determine the carrier concentration have been put forward. <b>The</b> one is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isoelectronic traps which decrease the carrier concentration while <b>the</b> other is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> defects which increase the carrier concentration. The calculated results of imaginary part of the elastivity of GaN and GaN 1 -xPx alloys show that the longitudinal optical phonon-plasmon (LPP) modes shift to high frequency direction and its linewidth gradually broadens with increasing carrier concentration in GaN 1 -xPx, indicating that the coupling of LPP modes gradually enhances and the damping of LPP modes gradually augments...|$|R

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, {{carrying out a}} second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were followed closely in the press.

He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Keith {{produced}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage {{was reported in}} Mexico, which was still recovering <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Gilbert two months prior. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was fairly minor but widespread, totaling $7.3million (1988USD; $ USD). Near the coast of Florida, damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion. Further inland there were floods, downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed on data from {{a national survey of}} US beef cow-calf producers to quantify <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> management factors on calf-morbidity risk from birth to weaning. The analysis included 2, 490 herds from 23 states. A high calf-morbidity herd was defined as one with greater than 10 % morbidity. The rate of dystocia in the herd was categorized into five levels. All dystocia levels were associated significantly with increased risk of being a high calf-morbidity herd. Having greater than 70 % of cows and heifers calve in confinement also was associated with increased risk of being a high calf-morbidity herd. Approximately 40 % of herds experienced high morbidity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> dystocia and approximately 10 % <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> confined calving.
