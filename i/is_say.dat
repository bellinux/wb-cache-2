Indeed, in practice even n3 or n2 algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.|$|E
500|$|Neither {{the police}} nor the fire {{department}} officially supported the project. The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part. The department's deputy chief medical officer Dr. David Prezant said, [...] "It's not our job to say you can't go. All we can do <b>is</b> <b>say</b> there's no proven evidence it works." ...|$|E
500|$|Follow the Leader {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephan Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "is an effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks." [...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, while saying that Korn [...] "have an ideal record for those long, black days when all you can do <b>is</b> <b>say</b> 'What the Fuck! What the Fuck! What the Fuck!' at bloody murder volume". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bright and}} pure {{colouring}} of the Persian miniature {{is one of}} its most striking features. [...] Normally all the pigments used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time. [...] The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or chiaroscuro. [...] Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building <b>is</b> (<b>say)</b> hexagonal in plan. [...] Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or [...] "cutaways" [...] with exterior views of other parts of a facade. [...] Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.|$|E

6000|$|No face {{which we}} can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where we are, but in a false position.

In sane moments we regard only the facts, the case that <b>is.</b> <b>Say</b> {{what you have to}} say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe.
