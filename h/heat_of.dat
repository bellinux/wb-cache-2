40|$|A {{calculation}} method for <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation (HOF, {{referred to as}} ∆Hf) based on the density func-tional theory (DFT) is presented in this work. Similar to Gaussian- 3 theory, the atomic scheme is applied to calculate the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation of the molecules. In this method, we have modified the formula for calculation of Gaussian- 3 theory in several ways, including the correction for diffuse functions and the correction for higher polarization functions. These corrections {{are found to be}} significant. The average absolute deviation from experiment for the 164 calculated <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> for-mation is about 1. 9 kcal·mol− 1, while average absolute deviation from G 3 MP 2 for the 149 (among the 164 molecules, 15 large-sized molecules can not be calculated at the G 3 MP 2 level) calculated <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation is only about 1. 9 kcal·mol− 1.

40|$|Abstract. B 3 LYP /aug-cc-pvdz {{level of}} theory, {{combined}} with NBO and G 3 methods, {{is applied to}} study substituent effects on the geometries, bond dissociation energies and high energetic density material properties of 27 kinds of derivatives designed by substituted hydrogen atoms of pentazine, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine and s-triazine, of which the hydrogen atoms are substituted by –CN,-NO 2,-NH 2,-N 3,-N 2 H,-NHNH 2,-N 4 H and-N 4 H 3 groups. The relatively small <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation are observed for the derivatives substituted by-NH 2,-H,-NO 2 and-NHNH 2. The order <b>of</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation for the derivatives containing the same substituent is: pentazine> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine>s-triazine. For the derivatives substituted by-CN,-N 2 H and-N 4 H 3, <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation are 860 ~ 1124 kJ/mol，in which <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation of 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivatives are larger. For derivatives substituted by-N 3 and-N 4 H, their <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation are 974 ∼ 1735 kJ/mol, which are the highest in all derivatives. The order <b>of</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation is: s-triazine derivative> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivative> pentazine derivative. The normalized <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation of these pentazine derivatives substituted by –CN,-N 3,- N 2 H and –N 4 H and 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivatives substituted by –CN,-N 3 and –N 4 H are 93 ∼ 109 kJ, which is {{higher than that of}} triazido-s-triazine and diazido-s-tetrazine derived from Hiskey. Our observations indicate that the higher <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation of substituent molecules have, the higher ones the substitutive derivatives. By means of the data of dissociation energy, it can be found that the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation of derivatives substituted by –N 3,-N 2 H and –CN are greater, and they are also more stable. It is possile for them to become energetic materials with high-energy and low sensitivity...|$|R
