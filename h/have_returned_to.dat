5|$|Once all results <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> normal, zinc (usually in {{the form}} of a zinc acetate {{prescription}} called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents their absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.|$|E

A tombstone was also discovered in Yangzhou, in the name of Catherine de Villioni, daughter of Dominici, who died there in 1342.|$|E
5|$|Progress M-43, {{which had}} been {{launched}} in 2000, undocked from Mir the day after Progress M1-5 launched, and was kept in orbit until Progress M1-5 docked. In the event that Progress M1-5 {{had been unable to}} dock, Progress M-43 would <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the station and provide supplies of food and oxygen for the Soyuz crew. Progress M-43 was deorbited after Progress M1-5 docked successfully.|$|E
5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time Venus and Earth <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> very nearly the same point in their {{respective}} orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the modern Karnataka region {{to focus on}} a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of epigraphs and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|In 1570, El Greco {{moved to}} Rome, where he {{executed}} {{a series of}} works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Venice (c. 1575–76) {{before he left for}} Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).|$|E

5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> pre-injury levels.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E

5|$|The 60Co {{source was}} {{transferred}} for storage at the OAEP headquarters. Subsequent surveys found radiation in the scrapyard to <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> normal background levels.

This was confirmed to be {{the origin of the}} source, and the three units were removed for temporary storage on 21 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The real GDP {{growth rate}} from 2002 to 2007 {{averaged}} 6.8 percent annually, which made Turkey {{one of the}} fastest growing economies in the world during that period.

The economy was estimated to <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> 8 percent growth in 2010. According to Eurostat data, Turkish GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power standard stood at 52 percent of the EU average in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while the soldiers are here, but when they go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E
