It is based on data collected via a field experiment with 501 rural consumers. Each consumer was randomly placed {{into one of the}} 3 treatment groups and received: <b>i)</b> <b>general</b> <b>information</b> about biofortification (Control), ii) general and positive information (Treatment 1) and iii) general and negative information (Treatment 2).

40|$|Personal Saving is a {{flexible}} source of investment, {{for both the}} public and private sectors, for which there is great competition. Saving is a natural phenomenon, but, in the sense that securities are bought and sold, it is one which is responsive to stimulation. Almost all securities have unique qualities, thereby limiting their appeal, and, moreover, in motivating saving, account has to be taken of political and economic pressures. Consequently, the market is subjected to excessive variables and these are best tracked through current articles in financial journals. This socio-economic study brings together (<b>i)</b> <b>general</b> <b>information</b> about money and Thrift institutions; (ii) collected statistics over a period; and (iii) several important market research projects. It concentrates the information drawn from a wide area by means of local inquiries, and endeavours to find points of agreement and difference between the populations which are mainly industrial and those which are largely rural. There must be the ability to save, but the willingness to do so is only partially decided by the level of rewards. There are moral, ethical, and sentimental overtones, historically founded, and these appear to be more steadfast in some environments than in others. Saving activity has some barren ground, and the potential savers 'have numbers of profligates within their ranks. Sex, age, and social class give no strong lead as to where the non-savers may be found. The National Savings Movement has a two-fold official policy, (i) to attract the flow of personal saving into the public sector, and,, (ii) to assist in educating the public in sound money management. Other thrift institutions share these aims in varying degrees, and they, too, mobilise goodwill and sentiments to attain their objects; devoting, of course, their funds to the private sector...|$|E

It describes the climate, soil types and fertility, water availability and vegetation in the various regions. It continues with a presentation of socio-economic backgrounds and different agricultural production systems. Finally it presents the institutional surroundings in the fields of research, extension, education, engineering, post-harvest handling and seed production and multiplication. Each of the other volumes focuses on an agricultural sub sector. Volume II on crops describes the country s plant genetic resources and continues with sections on cereals, oilcrops, roots and tubers, grains, plantains and traditional cashcrops. It briefly discusses such new areas as sericulture and mushroom cultivation. Volume III is dedicated to Uganda s forestry sector and forest resources: its history, current state and future potential.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} several {{issues in the}} {{semantics}} of Persian noun-determination, which has long been of interest to linguists of various theoretical backgrounds, but has only recently started receiving attention from formally-oriented semanticists. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce and elaborate on several of the more promising newer approaches to the problem of Persian noundetermination, and also to make a new contribution to the treatment of the pospositive case marker râ. Since the subject matter is enormous in scope, I will not make it my objective to make a full description of the Persian noun-determination system; rather, I will try to summarize the existing approaches to several important problems and to formulate a more or less coherent picture of how most of the Persian system could be treated from a formal semantic standpoint. It should specifically be noted that I will not touch upon issues related to discourse or pragmatic factors, which, as prior research shows, also have an important impact on how the Persian noun determination markers, especially –râ, are used. The paper is organized as follows. In the first section, I outline the main strategies of marking NPs in Persian, with the general outline of when each of them is used, according to the consensus in prior research; in the second section I will then list some of the problems that the traditional approach encounters. In the third section, the ‘set of alternatives ’ analysis for –i is described; in the fourth, the analysis of yek as a quantifier (with also a general description of quantifiers in Persian); in the fifth section, I introduce my proposal for treating the semantics of-râ. Finally, in the closing section, I outline the problems still not fully analyzed and the possible directions for future research. It should be noted that in my account I will deliberately limit myself to singular NPs functioning as core arguments of the verb, i. e. to subject and object NPs. As for plurality in Persian, it is another issue which is also quite complicated (see e. g. Ghomeshi 2003). <b>I.</b> <b>General</b> <b>information</b> The account given in this section is mostly based on existing grammars of Persian (among other...|$|E

40|$|Lead {{has been}} a long-standing public health issue, {{particularly}} {{with the introduction of}} lead in gasoline and paint and use of it in lead pipes in the past. Children have been considered particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure because of their developing nervous system; however, adults can also be physically affected by lead exposure. Because there are ways to minimize exposure and lessen lead’s harmful effects on the public’s health, understanding sources of lead and how exposure occurs are ways to begin to understand an individual’s risk to lead and ways that risk can be reduced. The following document explores not only common lead issues within the general population but also park-specific lead issues and ways to reduce lead exposure and minimize its impact on human health. In order to address potential lead exposure issues, this document is divided into three sections: <b>general</b> lead <b>information,</b> potential sources of lead exposure at national parks, and NPS efforts to reduce lead exposure. <b>I.</b> <b>General</b> lead <b>information</b> Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal that is blue-gray in color and is found in the earth’s crust.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the results of an ergonomics survey which contains eleven studies in five different industries of Thailand and four different industries of Japan (Papers A to K). The aims of the studies were; (i) to identify priority problems of female workers in different industries from ergonomic points of view; (ii) to analyze and investigate these problems; (iii) to examine the ergonomics intervention practices at work places; and iv) to develop a practical method for appropriate ergonomics interventions at work for improving health and safety of female workers, particularly in industrially developing countries. The survey consisted of four parts; (<b>i)</b> <b>general</b> <b>information</b> about ergonomics problems with regard to working conditions and environments of female workers which were obtained through preliminary research studies; (ii) preliminary survey of ergonomics problems regarding health and safety of female workers in different industries in Thailand; (iii) selection of two different industries of Thailand to carry out more detailed studies of physical and psycho-social problems, particularly related to musculoskeletal disorders; and (iv) examination of the ergonomics intervention practices at work places by case-study in Japan and Thailand. Methods used in these studies were; (i) ergonomics checklist; (ii) working environmental measurements; (iii) questionnaire study for subjective feeling of fatigue; (iv) grip strength and back and leg strength tests; (v) hearing test; (vi) questionnaire study for the assessment of musculoskeletal disorders {{in various parts of the}} body; (vii) psycho-social questionnaire study for analysis of stress at work as well as in daily life situation; (viii) anthropometric measurements of the standing and sitting positions; (ix) work posture analysis, using OWAS method; (x) job analysis, using AET method; (xi) simple clinical and physical fitness tests for checking musculoskeletal disorders; and (xii) using three different questionnaires, i. e., interviewing management, employees and governmental officers for examining ergonomics intervention practices at work places. The results showed that the female workers in different industries of the two countries had experienced musculo-skeletal discomforts in various parts of their body and work stress. The reasons for the high prevalence of such problems seem to be multifactorial and complicated. For instance, the female workers have prolonged standing or sitting postures during work, operating machines which are not appropriately designed, and doing heavy manual material handling. They adopt awkward work postures which usually lead to musculoskeletal disorders. The association between work postures and symptoms problems is a factor of exposure time. It becomes obvious that ergonomics problems related to occupational health and safety of the female workers in this survey seem to have cause-effect responses which could be classified into three main categories; (i) poor working practices and workplace programmes without sufficient knowledge of ergonomics principles; (ii) lack of adjustment to local population of imported machinery and equipment and their use; and (iii) lack of appropriate work organization. The tri-partites (management, employees and governmental officers) of the two countries had the same opinion about the importance of the ergonomics intervention programme. They desired co-operation and more participation approach to achieve better success in their intervention programmes. However, they had some shortcomings in their intervention programmes; such as lack of co-operation among industrial staff, lack of budget and human resources, differences in attitudes or awareness between the management and the employees with regard to occupational health and safety, lack of managerial support, lack of technical knowledge and unclarity of government policy. Based on the results, a practical method of ergonomics intervention at work is developed for improvement of working conditions of female workers which combines the following two characteristics: (a) participatory ergonomics training in order to develop awareness and understanding of practical ergonomics principles, and (b) industry-level promotional activities to facilitate voluntary participation and co-operation between managers, workers and government officers. In addition, further research activity is continuously needed for ergonomics implementation, particularly in the industrially developing countries. Godkänd; 1992; 20070429 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|The work {{specificity}} of long-term home care nurses restricts {{the opportunity of}} both studying and forming working conditions, which together with work organization and workers’ behaviour {{in the face of}} dangers present in the working environment determine the level of work safety and occupational risk associated with a particular job. In practice, little is known about this kind of workplaces and there is little control over working conditions. So, it is an important task to establish the kind of hazards one must take into account in a given workplace, the reasons for these hazards, their results and actions which might be taken in these circumstances concerning the safety and health protection of this profession. The proposed checklist for the evaluation of the working conditions of long-term home care nurses consists of 6 parts: part <b>I</b> – <b>general</b> <b>information</b> about the workplace, part II – work-related complaints felt by the nurse, part III – working conditions in the home habitat, part IV – tasks performed by the nurse in the home habitat, part V – list of hazards identified in the home habitat, and part VI – summary of the evaluation of the workplace...|$|R
