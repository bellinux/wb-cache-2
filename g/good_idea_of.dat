5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the issues he would address.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E

5000|$|Writers like Bostrom use {{the term}} super{{intelligence}} in place of Good's ultraintelligence. Following Vernor Vinge, <b>Good's</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> intelligence explosion {{has come to be}} associated with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "technological singularity". Bostrom and researchers at MIRI have expressed skepticism about the views of singularity advocates like Ray Kurzweil that superintelligence is [...] "just around the corner". MIRI researchers have advocated early safety work as a precautionary measure, while arguing that past predictions of AI progress have not been reliable.|$|R
25|$|Çatalhöyük (Central Turkey) is {{considered}} the most advanced of these, and Çayönü in the east the oldest (c. 7250 - 6750 BCE). We have a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the town layout at Çayönü, based on a central square with buildings constructed of stone and mud. Archeological finds include farming tools that suggest both crops and animal husbandry as well as domestication of the dog. Religion is represented by figurines of Cybele, a mother goddess. Hacilar (Western Turkey) followed Çayönü, and has been dated to 7040 BCE.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing terra cotta miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves {{gives us a}} <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws). Loaves of flat bread {{could be used as}} plates, but terra cotta bowls were more common.|$|E
25|$|Carving {{in relief}} is common enough, idols being {{produced}} in many forms. The South African carves {{the handle of}} his spoon perhaps {{in the form of}} a giraffe, and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The North American Indian shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of pipe stems. The Papuan has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the guilloche. The native of New Guinea also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in Scandinavian countries. The work of the New Zealander is greatly in advance of the average primitive type; he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The Maori wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the Hindu he has a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.|$|E
50|$|In {{his article}} for The Nation, Prashad lays out {{his vision for}} the {{struggle}} toward socialism. He argues progressive forces typically have very <b>good</b> <b>ideas,</b> but no power.

25|$|Linz. The Roman fort of ‘Lentia’ was {{established}} {{early in the}} 1st century to the S of Linz Castle and probably between the Romergasse and the Baumbach strasse. The Bavarians established themselves here in the 8th century or earlier and the surviving church of St Martin (W.of Castle) was first mentioned in 799. A market was mentioned in 844 (?) and this probably refers to the ‘Alte Stadt’, a settlement with a Y ‘Dreiech’ market place, which grew up to the E of the Castle. In 1240 Linz was granted a charter {{and it may have}} been at this time that the new town with a long rectangular market place and a grid plan was laid out to the E of the Alte Stadt. Both this new town and the Alte Stadt were now enclosed in a rectangular defensive system, presumably walled, which was joined to the Castle on the W side. The Braun and Hogenberg print of 1594 gives a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how the Medieval town developed. There were square towers on the four corners of the walled town, a gate-tower leading to the bridge, built in 1497 across the Danube on the N and a tall watch tower on the gate leading from the market place in the S. This view looking across the Danube from the N was copied with modification by Merian in 1679 and Vischer in 1672, but Merian in 1679 adds a completely new view (from the E) of Linz showing that it had been extensively re-fortified with three large roundels added on the E and S and two roundells to the W of the Castle. The Roundels were joined by a massive curtain wall and a wide inner moat or ditch. There were no additional defences on the N (Danube). This defensive work seems to be more likely to be 16th, rather than 17th century in date. The walls were demolished by the French from 1800 onwards. The Franz II Kataster (Map - post 1817) shows only one Roundell and the two gate-towers remaining and these had been demolished by the 1830s. Today only parts of the moat survive in the Theater Platz and Oberes Graben.|$|E

Public libraries are a particular type of information provision, where information is thought of as a public <b>good.</b> <b>Ideas</b> <b>of</b> information as a public good lead to discussions of the role of information and information provision in democratic societies.

500|$|September 10, 1778, General Grey {{in command}} of a {{transport}} of eighty-two sails and ten thousand British troops made a raid upon the Vineyard, carrying off all the sheep, swine, cattle and oxen that could be found.

500|$|Kanō became {{active in}} the work of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1909. This came about after Kristian Hellström of the Swedish Olympic Committee wrote to the {{government}}s of Japan and China to ask if they were going to send teams to the 1912 Olympics. The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kanō, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, [...] "a fairly <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what the Olympic Games were." ...|$|E

500|$|Hitler's own {{reckless}} {{optimism and}} determination {{to hold on}} to captured territory at all costs encouraged him to believe the picture suggested by the Russians. Meanwhile, his advisors believed the Soviet Union was running out of men and materiel, with much less industrial production than it in fact had. Thus they underestimated the forces ranged against them, a belief encouraged by continued deception operations. Pirnie points out that it did not have to succeed in every aspect to be successful. In Belarus, the German armies involved had a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the locations and approximate timing of Operation Bagration, but the higher levels, Army Group Centre and OKH failed to appreciate how strong the attacks would be, or the intention to encircle the Army Group. The [...] "combination of display and concealment, directed at the highest command levels, typified their most successful deception." ...|$|E
500|$|Bonass {{signed for}} Chesterfield, newly {{promoted}} to the Second Division, for a £250 fee in May 1936. He went straight into the starting eleven, scored the opening goal in the first home match of the new season, against Norwich City, and the Derby Evening Telegraphs correspondent was impressed: [...] "Bonass, at outside-left, was the pick of the line, for he generally shot accurately, and he showed a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> combination." [...] At Christmas he scored the only goal of the game against Aston Villa, and contributed two– one a neat back-heel– to a 4–0 win against Swansea Town on New Year's Day. His goal return for the season was 14 from 39 league games as Chesterfield finished in mid-table, and {{he was part of}} the team that beat Derby County to win the Derbyshire Senior Cup.|$|E

Chris Jones, writing for BBC Music said [...] "everything great about the Who is contained herein." [...] In 2013, Billboard, reviewing the album for its 40th anniversary, said: [...] "Filled with performances packed with life and depth and personality, Quadrophenia is 90 minutes of the Who at its very best." [...] The album has sold 1 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2000 Q magazine placed Quadrophenia at #56 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album has been ranked #267 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
