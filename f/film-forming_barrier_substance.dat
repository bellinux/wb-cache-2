40|$|Objective: Knowing {{the motivations}} and <b>barriers</b> <b>substance</b> dependents come across when seeking {{treatment}} has medical {{and public health}} implications. The study's aim was to formulate hypothesis on psychosocial variables forming subjective motivations to treatment related to the depressive symptoms. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted on an intentional sample of 13 substance dependents looking for formal treatment; transcribed in-depth semi-structured interviews underwent a content analysis. Results: Five categories were formulated, disclosing the possible extension of the relations between depressive symptoms and treatment demand: perceptions of feeling guilty; perceptions of low self-esteem, loss of confidence of nearby people; suicidal and self-harm ideas; perception of causality and chronology of depressive symptoms; a pharmacological logics related to these symptoms. Conclusions: The interviewees have a proper understanding on the seeking treatment process and seem to evaluate subjectively the involved variables, being prominent the evaluation of depressive symptoms' discomfort, hardly communicated or consciously perceived in their particularities. Therefore, it is required a professional attention on this issue, especially in primary care settings. Two hypotheses are formulated: a subpopulation identifies psychoactive substances depressive effects and seek treatment earlier; the identification of mild depressive symptoms agilize the process of seeking help.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were the {{extraction}} of hemicellulose from wheat straw (WS) and its utilization in the reinforcement of a κ-carrageenan/locust bean gum (κ-car/LBG) polymeric blend films (PBFs). WS hemicellulose extraction was performed under autohydrolysis process and hemicellulose extracted (HE) under optimum condition was used in PBFs. PBFs were prepared varying different proportions of HE into the κ-car/LBG <b>film-forming</b> solutions. <b>Barrier</b> properties (water vapor permeability, WVP), mechanical properties (tensile-strength, TS, and elongation-at-break, EB), moisture content, opacity and thermal properties of the resulting PBFs were determined and related with the incorporation of HE. The 2 - 3 - 2 proportion (in the high ratio) of PBF (κ-car/LBG/HE) causes a slight decrease of WVP and an increase of the TS, thus resulting in an improvement of the physical properties of PBFs. HE showed to be a promising material in order to reinforce κ-car/LBG PBF and can be an alternative in the application of hemicellulose according to biorefinery concept. The authors Hector A.

Furthermore, multi-group CFA tests were used to test equivalencies of the measurement and structural models. The statistical fit results supported the invariance of the ethnic groups. Although there were some gender and age differences in measurement and structural relations among the external barrier facets, the model fit indices results provided support for the invariance of both measurement and structural models. The findings suggest that it would be reasonable to consider the pattern of factor loadings and structure relations as invariant across gender, ethnic, and age groups...|$|R

This is particularly evident in the packaging industry, where replacing synthetic polymers with renewable materials is of considerable interest. Materials for food packaging need to give protection, acting as a <b>barrier</b> against <b>substances</b> that can adversely affect the food quality such as water and oxygen. In this work, barrier dispersion coatings based on starch were used to produce coated papers which act as barrier against water and oxygen. However, since starch is both a hydrophilic and hygroscopic material, this barrier material becomes problematic to use at high relative humidity. In order to reduce this problem and improve the barrier properties enabling starch based barrier materials {{to be used in}} food packaging applications, two approaches were studied. Citric acid was utilized as a cross-linker of the starch and it was found to reduce the moisture sorption, the molecular movement and swelling at high relative humidity. It was seen that cross-linking and hydrolysis due to the low pH both affected the barrier properties significantly, but in opposing directions. By controlling these two reactions it was seen that this could lead to reduced gas permeability. It was also seen that cross-linking of starch by citric acid occurs at low temperatures, 70 °C at pH as high as 6. 5. Starch nano-composites were produced by incorporating montmorillonite, to the barrier dispersion to improve the barrier properties. It was seen that the suspension viscosity was reduced by poly(ethylene glycol) and citric acid adsorption on the montmorillonite particles. Also, a tendency for improved barrier properties with reduced aggregate volume fraction and reduced swelling was observed. It was also seen that up scaling this formulation to pilot scale was possible and that promising results were achieved.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of eight welfare-to-work programs between 1998 and 2000 in Chicago to identify successful program elements, isolate barriers to employment presented by participants, and make recommendations for welfare reform policy. The programs were {{both large and}} small, of both long and short duration, and provided a variety of services, from vocational training to shorter job placement-focused activities. By reviewing quantitative findings {{within the context of}} qualitative data gathered through staff and participant interviews, we have identified elements of successful programming and welfare policy recommendations that flow from them. Sample Demographics: Our sample consisted of 843 participants in these eight programs over the two-year period. [...] The mean number of children across the sample was 2. 57. [...] 46. 7 % had earned a high school diploma or GED. [...] Average reading levels were 7. 70 and 6. 46 for math. [...] 81. 5 % of the sample had been employed at some point prior to entering the program. [...] The average length of time on welfare was 6. 97 years. Employment Rates and Drop Rates: Analyzing all those participants who showed up at the programs after intake, the employment rate was 56. 1 % and the drop rate was 43. 9 %. Those who found employment were younger, had a slightly lower average number of children, and slightly more had been ever employed prior to entering the program. Reasons for Program Drop Outs: The four most commonly cited reasons for drop were child care, health, substance abuse, and low literacy. Child care drop outs were on average older, more poorly educated, and less likely to have been employed in the past. Almost half the child care drop outs had school age children in addition to younger children, giving rise to the hypothesis that they had difficulty in finding child care for so many different age groups. Nearly 80 % of the health problems involved the health of the participant rather than other family members. Women who dropped out due to health problems had higher literacy and numeracy levels than the overall sample, as well as a much longer average time on welfare (11. 95 years versus 6. 97 years). Fewer participants with health problems had ever been employed (75. 6 %) compared to the overall sample (81. 7 %), indicating that these health problems have and continue to be employment <b>barriers.</b> <b>Substance</b> abusers dropped out later in the program than other drop outs. They too have been on welfare for a longer time than the overall sample- 8. 67 years versus 6. 97 years. Since their average employment history was about the same as the overall sample, it is likely that substance abuse causes participants to lose successive jobs, a factor that is associated with longer stays on welfare. Participants who dropped out due to low literacy had average reading scores of 4. 54 and math scores of 3. 96, considerably lower than the overall sample, and had longer years on welfare (8. 34 compared to 6. 46 for the entire sample).

The archetypal vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, arose in evolution as a signal affecting neural cells, but was later co-opted by blood vessels to regulate vascular function. Consequently, VEGF represents an attractive target to modulate brain function at the neurovascular interface. On the one hand, VEGF is neuroprotective, through direct effects on neural cells and their progenitors and indirect effects on brain perfusion. In accordance, preclinical studies show beneficial effects of VEGF administration in neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and epilepsy. On the other hand, pathologically elevated VEGF levels enhance vessel permeability and leakage, and disrupt blood-brain barrier integrity, as in demyelinating diseases, for which blockade of VEGF may be beneficial.

Furthermore, olive oil, ethanol and purified water were selected as the comparisons to jojoba oil. The relationship of physicochemical properties of fragrances with onto their alternative skin membrane permeation was investigated using skin permeation and evaporation experiments. From these results, membrane permeation of fragrances from jojoba and olive oils were lower than that from purified water. / 皮膚に塗布した物質の有効性や安全性を評価するには，それらの皮膚透過性を把握することが重要である。ほとんどの化学物質の皮膚透過速度は，Fickの拡散則に従い，塗布濃度と皮膚バリア中の濃度勾配に比例する。化学物質のなかには皮膚塗布部位から揮発し，物質濃度が減少するものもあるため，単純にFickの拡散則を適用できない場合もある。そこで，蒸気圧の異なる 4 種類の香料成分と主にアロマテラピーで基材として用いられているホホバオイルを用いて，香料成分の皮膚代替膜透過性および揮発性の評価を行った。また，その他基材として，ホホバオイルと物性のよく似ているオリーブオイル，さらに一般的な溶媒であるエタノールおよび精製水も用い，香料成分の皮膚透過性に及ぼす基材の影響を調べた。得られた結果より，香料の膜透過性は香料の基材の影響を受け，ホホバオイルやオリーブオイルからの香料成分の透過性は水基材からの透過性よりも低値となることがわかった...|$|R
40|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer {{requires}} the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances in most developed countries by January 1, 1996. Developing, or Article 5, {{countries have been}} allowed additional time in which to produce these chemicals. Contrary to the Protocol`s intent, current estimates indicate that production of these chemicals by Article 5 countries could easily equal that of the developed world before their production is required to be eliminated. The Montreal Protocol also requires that used chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) and halons are disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner. One mechanism devised by the Montreal Protocol {{to reduce the amount}} of ozone-depleting substances that may need to be destroyed is to transfer those chemicals to Article 5 countries. Theoretically, this has the added benefit of also eliminating the need for additional production by those countries. This paper discusses the major issues associated with the disposal/destruction of ozone-depleting substances, including the transfer of these chemicals to Article 5 countries. Potential implications of the <b>barriers</b> to ozone-depleting <b>substance</b> transfer on the viability of the Montreal Protocol will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} of existing concrete structures has increasingly attracted widespread attention in recent years. The phenomenon of performance degradation is {{often associated with}} the intrusion of hazardous ions from outside. As the first <b>barrier</b> to external <b>substances</b> intrusion, the near-surface concrete {{plays an important role in}} durability. So the performance of in-service concrete structures often depends on the transport properties of the near-surface concrete. Accordingly, information on service conditions and life prediction can be obtained by testing these transport properties. In this paper, an in situ method for chloride ion diffusion coefficient determination is proposed based on the relationship between the alternating current impedance spectroscopy parameters and the chloride ion diffusion coefficient. By a rational design, the new method can synthetically reflect the transport properties of near-surface concrete and is not affected by the presence of the reinforcing bar. In addition, the experimental results show that the method is in good agreement with “PERMIT” migration test which has been widely used. The proposed method is less time consuming and nondestructive and has good reproducibility...|$|R
