5|$|The {{camphor tree}} (Cinnamomum camphora) {{produces}} an essential {{oil and the}} <b>eucalyptus</b> tree (<b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus) is {{the main source of}} <b>eucalyptus</b> oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} {{is found}} in <b>Eucalyptus</b> woodland, most commonly of wandoo (<b>Eucalyptus</b> wandoo) or salmon gum (E. salmonophloia). It is also found nearby pine plantations and sandplains or kwongan heath with abundant Hakea, Banksia, and Grevillea shrubs.|$|E
5|$|River {{channels}} {{in the region}} support River Red Gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> camaldulensis) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) communities. Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (<b>Eucalyptus</b> largiflorens) woodlands and a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey. Yellow Box (<b>Eucalyptus</b> melliodora) and Grey Box (<b>Eucalyptus</b> microcarpa) occur along with Cypress Pine (Callitris glaucophylla) on areas rarely subjected to flooding. The area away from the rivers often consists of treeless plains, consisting of various saltbush (Atriplex) species, Cotton Bush (Maireana aphylla) and varieties of Danthonia and Austrostipa native grasslands.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus), Smithton peppermint (<b>Eucalyptus</b> nitida), messmate stringybark (<b>Eucalyptus</b> obliqua), snow gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> pauciflora), manna gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (<b>Eucalyptus</b> amygdalina).|$|E
5|$|In the 1983 concept plan, 413 {{plant species}} were identified, {{including}} 124 {{that were not}} native to the park. The park was noted {{as one of the}} few remaining significant areas of bushland in the foothills. By 2006, the flora list contained 411 species, with 107 of these non-native. Five of the native species were then noted as rare or vulnerable, including Prasophyllum pallidum (pale leek-orchid). The park has significant stands of pink gums (<b>Eucalyptus</b> fasciculosa) and long-leafed box (<b>Eucalyptus</b> goniocalyx). button daisy, pussy tail (Ptilotus macrocephalus), needlebush (Hakea sericea), silky guinea flower (Hibbertia sericea) and black rapier sedge (Lepidosperma carphoides) are common. black-boys (Xanthorrhoea), hop bush (Dodonaea viscosa ssp. spatulata) and tea-tree form the understory in parts of the park. The area around the ruins of Newman's Nursery is noted for its spring orchid display. Quarry floors have large plants typical of much of the Mount Lofty Ranges. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata), as well as red gums (<b>Eucalyptus</b> camaldulensis), native pine (Callitris preissii) and blue gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> leucoxylon) are common.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia is {{only found}} in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only {{known from the}} {{original}} specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many <b>Eucalyptus</b> species such as <b>Eucalyptus</b> brachycalyx, <b>Eucalyptus</b> oleosa and <b>Eucalyptus</b> gracilis abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and <b>eucalyptus.</b> Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous <b>Eucalyptus</b> flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the <b>eucalyptus</b> tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of <b>eucalyptus</b> trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the forest areas around Pichilemu are covered with pine and <b>eucalyptus</b> plantations, a native forest (now the Municipal Forest) remains. It contains species such as Litres, Quillayes, Boldos, Espinos, and Peumos.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of <b>Eucalyptus</b> marginata (Jarrah) with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or <b>Eucalyptus</b> gomphocephala (Tuart), and an understorey of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), Acacia cyclops (Coastal Wattle), Acacia saligna (Orange Wattle), Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (<b>Eucalyptus</b> marginata) and karri (<b>Eucalyptus</b> diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
5|$|Many {{non-native}} plants also {{thrive in}} Phoenix including, {{but not limited}} to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, cardon cactus, acacia, <b>eucalyptus,</b> aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise.|$|E
5|$|Ornamental plants {{suitable}} for growing in containers, such as Agastache foeniculum, Agave, Alocasia esculenta, Amaranthus, Canna × generalis, Celosia, Coleus, Colocasia, Cordyline, Cuphea, Cycad, Duranta erecta, <b>Eucalyptus</b> cinerea, Fuchsia, Hibiscus acetosella, Iresine, Lantana camara, Melianthus major, Perilla frutescens, Phormium tenax, Salpiglossis sinuata, and Solenostemon scutellarioides.|$|E
5|$|The Wulgulmerang form, located to {{the north}} and east of Omeo, to Wulgulmerang and the Little River. The flower limb is a more {{yellow-brown}} and the infructescences resemble those of B.marginata. It is found among granite rocks in association with the candlebark (<b>Eucalyptus</b> rubida).|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies vaguely {{resemble}} those of the species Gymnopaxillus nudus, found in Australia growing in association with <b>Eucalyptus.</b> However, Gymnopaxillus fruit bodies grow underground, lack a strong odor, do not stain purple with potassium hydroxide, and have longer spores, typically 11–16µm.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of their diet {{is made up}} of plant material such as pollen, berries, nectar, from such species as grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) and scarlet gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> phoenicea), and cultivated crops such as bananas or particularly grapes. In general, birds prefer feeding at cup-shaped sources such as flowers of the Darwin woollybutt (<b>Eucalyptus</b> miniata), Darwin stringybark (E. tetrodonta) and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa), followed by brush-shaped inflorescences, such as banksias or melaleucas, gullet-shaped inflorescences such as grevilleas, with others less often picked.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in <b>eucalyptus</b> woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these {{cockatoos}} are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally <b>Eucalyptus.</b> Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{describes}} {{the island of}} Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which he considers extremely poor. On some hills he finds <b>Eucalyptus</b> (gum) trees, a genus from Australia; he finds the vegetation monotonous also.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah (<b>Eucalyptus</b> marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist peaty soil. The dominant trees include M. preissiana, swamp banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs swamp peppermint (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E
5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of <b>Eucalyptus</b> baxteri (brown stringybark), <b>Eucalyptus</b> camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by land clearing and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain. The subspecies and its habitat {{are the subject of}} a national recovery plan. In 2007 local landowners are being reimbursed for assisting in regenerating suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (<b>Eucalyptus</b> gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Koala Territory {{was first}} opened in 2005, and houses three koalas, two males named Gooanroo and Yabbra, {{and a female}} named Alinga. Yooranah was the {{offspring}} of Alinga and Goonaroo, and was born in 2013 and died in 2016. Koala Territory is decorated with Aboriginal-inspired artwork, and features a garden of <b>eucalyptus</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|The 7.5-acre parcel was rezoned in 2010 {{for senior}} housing that was {{expected}} to provide a new customer base for the restaurants and retailers already {{in the area and}} for commercial developments still to come. The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at Mesa Verde opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and <b>eucalyptus</b> trees were saved and replanted on the site.|$|E
5|$|The Agnes Banks Woodland {{in western}} Sydney has been {{recognised}} by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here Banksia aemula is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> sclerophylla), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) and B. serrata as canopy trees, and B. oblongifolia, Conospermum taxifolium, Ricinocarpus pinifolius, Dillwynia sericea and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E
5|$|The birds live {{primarily}} in open <b>eucalyptus</b> forests and woodlands. They range mostly from Atherton Tableland, Queensland, down to Tasmania and west to Eyre Peninsula, in South Australia. They roost communally, usually nocturnally. During the breeding season, they nest in large flocks {{to make sure}} to keep predators away from young. These flocks can be 20-30 dusky woodswallows in size.|$|E
5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and {{semi-arid}} areas. Nests {{are found}} in Acacia, Agathis, Banksia, Casuarina and <b>Eucalyptus</b> woodland, in pastures, Callitris forests, city parks, farmlands, grasslands, heath, sand dunes, savanna woodland, swamps, urban gardens, wet rain-forests, wet and dry sclerophyll woodland, and even in buildings such as hotels and houses.|$|E
5|$|The modern koala is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around {{the same size as}} the modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open <b>Eucalyptus</b> woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised <b>eucalyptus</b> diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, Banksia serrata {{is found}} on well-drained sandy soils that {{are low in}} nutrients, and is often found on stabilised soil near the coast but just behind the main dune system. In the Sydney region it is found with other typical {{woodland}} species, including yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia), red bloodwood (C. gummifera), silvertop ash (<b>Eucalyptus</b> sieberi), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata) and Sydney peppermint (E. piperita).|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the main}} {{industry}} of Pichilemu, especially in the urban centre and some rural areas such as Cáhuil and Ciruelos. Forestry, mainly pine and <b>eucalyptus,</b> is another major industry. The area is also known for handicrafts. Although fishing is not very important to O'Higgins Region, due to unsuitable coastlines, it is common in Pichilemu, Bucalemu, and Navidad.|$|E
5|$|Where {{rainfall}} {{is relatively}} evenly {{spread across the}} seasons in temperate regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found. Temperate forest {{is also found in}} the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by <b>Eucalyptus</b> forest and open acacia woodland.|$|E
5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} {{columns in}} search of food. They forage into buildings, <b>eucalyptus</b> trees, ground areas or on low vegetation. Workers are both diurnal and nocturnal, {{but they are not}} active throughout any 24-hour period. Low activity occurs during clear sunny days; however, colonies are extremely active shortly after rain.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E
5|$|A saprobe or parasite, O.nidiformis is nonspecific in its {{needs and}} is {{compatible}} {{with a wide variety}} of hosts. It has been recorded on native Banksia (including B.attenuata and B.menziesii), Hakea, Acacia, Nuytsia floribunda and various Myrtaceae, including Agonis flexuosa and Melaleuca species, and especially <b>Eucalyptus,</b> as well as Nothofagus, Casuarina species and Allocasuarina fraseriana, and even introduced trees such as Pinus or Platanus species. It plays an important role in breaking down wood and recycling nutrients into the soil.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (<b>Eucalyptus</b> and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and <b>Eucalyptus</b> trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
5|$|Between Sydney and Brisbane, B.integrifolia {{is found}} up to 200 {{kilometres}} (125mi) inland, with B.integrifolia subsp. monticola {{occurring in the}} Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with <b>Eucalyptus</b> species such as E.viminalis (manna gum) and E.pauciflora (snow gum), and also rainforest species such as Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech) and Orites excelsa (prickly ash).|$|E
