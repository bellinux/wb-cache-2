40|$|Electricity {{generation}} {{is the major}} emission source of air pollutants in the highly industrialized Pearl River Delta Region. In a compact region like the Pearl River Delta, pollutants can easily transfer from one city to another. The research question {{of this study is}} to construct an optimal and mutual agreeable scheme to reduce electricity consumption in the Pearl River Delta Region, which involves the collaboration of all cities in the Region. The main objective of the study is to conduct a cooperative scheme that internalizes the external social cost of electricity consumption through optimal electricity consumption reduction. This research first surveys papers on urban environmental problems, especially environmental problems caused in Pearl River Delta Region. Literature review indicates that public electricity {{generation is}} the major emission source of air pollutants in this region. Secondly, this research reviews literatures on the social costs of electricity consumption. Reviews show that external costs of electricity consumption in different countries differ widely, ranging from 13 % to 700 % of electricity price. This study adopts the lower quartile of this range, which is 13 % of electricity price. Thirdly, urban operations research is reviewed, and a major policy instrument for environmental improvement, environmental tax, is investigated. This study develops a hierarchical structure of urban operations research to study the collaborative management of electricity consumption reduction in the Pearl River Delta Region. This urban operations research model includes seven essential steps: problem definition; objectives identification; performance measures; data analysis; analytical framework construction; model solution and courses of actions; and policy implementation. Moreover, this novel urban operations research model is applied in collaborative management of electricity consumption reduction in the Pearl River Delta. This research uses statistical and mathematical methods to estimate the parameters relevant to GDP, electricity consumption, external costs of electricity consumption, and environmental tax, and then formulates the operational model. Then, this model is employed to evaluate non-cooperative equilibrium condition among the eleven Pearl River Delta cities under a non-cooperative market outcome; to derive individual city’s external cost of electricity; to <b>derive</b> environmental <b>levy</b> and optimal electricity consumption reduction; and to design a compensation plan. In the compensation plan, under cooperation, in both 2013 and 2014, four cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, and Dongguan) have to pay for their net spillover external cost of electricity consumption. The other seven cities (Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Huizhou, Zhaoqing, Hong Kong, Macao, and Zhongshan) would receive compensation. The urban operations research model for regional cooperation in electricity consumption reduction developed in this study provides an instrument to deal with the pollution problem in the Pearl River Delta Region. It facilitates the exploration of hitherto intractable problems in regional environmental cooperation and established solution plans. The urban operations model is expected to provide practical policy choices for a Pearl River Delta environmental collaboration scheme. This research represents the first attempt on an application of urban operations research model of collaborative management scheme of electricity consumption reduction in Pearl River Delta Region. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Methods of data analysis used is First; Analysis of growth, the growth analysis will be used to determine the development of regional real revenues in addition to knowing how big the increase and decrease in each year, the Second; Analysis of the contribution, and the Third; Analysis of Efficiency and Effectiveness. Results of analysis showed that the development of revenue growth in the market levy from year to year has increased while revenue from parking charges are always fluctuating and even tended to decrease. Revenue Growth reception area also fluctuated. Contribution analysis shows that the contribution of market acceptance of user charges and parking levies against region income fluctuated. and for the efficiency and effectiveness analysis shows that revenue <b>derived</b> from market <b>levies</b> can be categorized as having adequate levels of efficiency while the revenue from parking charges, only after the regional autonomy has a less than efficient level after the regional autonomy.

40|$|The {{solution}} of a unitarily transformed Dirac equation for the hydrogenic electron in zero magnetic field is investigated here. The momentum-space representation is adopted {{as a natural}} recourse. The spinor part of the transformed wavefunction in momentum space can be easily prescribed for a central potential. Hence, for the Coulomb potential, a pair of equations is obtained for the radial components in momentum space. It is shown that starting from these radial equations, one can recover the equations previously <b>derived</b> by Rubinowicz, <b>Levy,</b> and Lombardi for {{the problem of the}} Dirac hydrogen atom in momentum space. This establishes equivalence among different approaches based on the momentum representation, including the current treatment. The recovery of the equations due to Rubinowicz permits the exact eigenvalues to be written down and exact expressions to be derived for the radial components of the transformed wavefunction in momentum space. A new approach is adopted to carry out a reduction to the nonrelativistic regime and the nonrelativistic limit. At first the transformed momentum-space equation for the hydrogen atom is rewritten in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates. The zeroth-order solutions of the new equation are recovered in the limit c [...] > infinity where c is the speed of light. These are manifestly separable into positive- and negative-energy forms. For positive energy, these solutions have nonvanishing upper components that are two-component spinors. The latter exactly correspond to the single-component, nonrelativistic, momentum-space solutions derived by Fock. It is shown that when the upper component is corrected through first order in v(2) /c(2) but the separability is still maintained for the transformed wavefunction, one retrieves the Pauli equation in momentum space. It is also shown that for a hydrogen atom placed in a uniform magnetic field, the nonvanishing momentum-space matrix elements representing the anomalous Zeeman effect have a simple form, namely, the product of a radial integral and an angular integral. These integrals are equal to the well-known radial and angular integrals in coordinate representation. The matrix elements can be easily evaluated. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

[...] Royal monopoly of holding castles was abolished under King Béla IV (1235 - 1270). Hundreds of new castles were built in this period by noblemen. [...] "The ispáns of counties shall not render judicial sentences concerning the estates of the servientes except in cases pertaining to coinage and tithes." [...] Golden Bull of 1222 Counts were also entitled to render justice in their districts. Heads of a county had jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of that county, but otherwise the counts' jurisdiction only covered the commoners who lived in the estates attached to the castle. Each comes appointed his own judicial deputy to assist him. However, more and more landowners received immunity from the jurisdiction of the comes from the monarchs. Furthermore, a rebellion of the so-called [...] "royal servants" [...] (in fact landowners directly subjected to the sovereign) forced King Andrew II to issue a charter known as the Golden Bull of 1222 which exempted them of the jurisdiction of the ispáns. The development of towns set further limits to the counts' authority, since at least 20 settlements received the right to self-government under King Béla IV (1235 - 1270). Counties were developing from an institute of royal administration into a body of self-government of the local noblemen {{in the course of the}} 13th century, but the ispán, [...] "a royal appointee" [...] (Erik Fügedi) remained their heads. Accordingly, the ispáns supervised the activities of the judges elected by the community of local noblemen with the task to [...] "revise existing property rights" [...] (Pál Engel) in many counties in Transdanubia in 1267. The existence of the institution of elected [...] "judges of the nobles" [...] is documented in more and more counties from the 1280s.
