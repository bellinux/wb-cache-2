5|$|Dugongidae, unlike Trichechidae, is paraphyletic, {{comprising}} the Dugonginae and Hydrodamalinae (which are both monophyletic) and the paraphyletic Halitheriinae. The tusks of modern day dugongs may have originally {{have been used}} for digging, but they are now used for social interaction. The genus <b>Dugong</b> probably originated in the Indo-Pacific area.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The <b>dugong</b> has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a <b>dugong.</b>|$|E

5|$|The three extant manatee species (family Trichechidae) and the <b>Dugong</b> (family Dugongidae) {{are rated}} as {{vulnerable}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.

5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the <b>dugong)</b> and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and <b>Dugong</b> face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (<b>Dugong</b> dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E

The waters around Borneo support a small population, with more scattered throughout the Malay archipelago. All the islands of the Philippines are believed to have once provided habitats for <b>dugongs,</b> which were common until the 1970s. Populations exist around the Solomon Islands archipelago and New Caledonia, stretching to an easternmost population in Vanuatu. A highly isolated population lives around the islands of Palau.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dugongs</b> {{and other}} {{sirenians}} are not {{closely related to}} other marine mammals, being more related to elephants. <b>Dugongs</b> and elephants share a monophyletic group with hyraxes and the aardvark, {{one of the earliest}} offshoots of eutherians. The fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the Eocene, where they most likely lived in the Tethys Ocean. The two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the mid-Eocene, after which the <b>dugongs</b> and their closest relative, the Steller's sea cow, split off from a common ancestor in the Miocene. The Steller's sea cow became extinct in the 18th century. No fossils exist of other members of the Dugongidae.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ecology of <b>dugongs</b> in Moreton Bay, a 1400 km 2 embayment in sub-tropical south-east Queensland (27. 5 " S, 153. 3 " E). The dugongs' distribution, movements, home range, habitat selection, feeding, diet and food preferences were examined {{in relation to the}} seagrass and physical resources. I considered the ways in which <b>dugongs</b> affect the seagrasses and the significance of the dugongs' role in the seagrass system. Seagrasses were quantitatively mapped in two study areas, encompassing 133 krn 2 of seagrass. Seven species of seagrass formed 15 recognised communities, which collapsed into five community-groups. Communities dominated by species of Halophila were the most widespread, covering 51 % of the total area of seagrass, but they were characterised by low biomass, and accounted for only 9 % of the total standing crop of seagrass (total = 12, 808 tonnes dry weight). In comparison, communities dominated by Zostera capricorni (broad-leaf morph) occupied only 38 % of the area of seagrass, but contained 75 % of the seagrass standing crop. The annual, above-ground production of seagrass within the study areas was estimated to be 41, 728 tonnes dry weight. Zostera capricorni, the dominant species in terms of biomass (57. 5 % of total above-ground standing crop), accounted for 34 % of the total, while the species of Halophila accounted for 36. 6 %, despite representing only 20. 5 % of above-ground standing crop. The distinct seasonality of Moreton Bay was highly correlated with pronounced changes in seagrass abundance. There was a distinct summer/autumn peak in the abundance of most species. Zostera capricorni alone had a winterlspring growth period. Averaged across all species, shoot density, above-ground and belowground biomass changed by factors of 1. 9, 2. 3 and 2. 3, respectively, between seasons of minimum and maximum abundance. Based on 28 aerial surveys, I estimate a Moreton Bay population of 600 <b>dugongs.</b> During spring and summer the <b>dugongs</b> were relatively sedentary, however, during winter the <b>dugongs</b> undertook regular migrations between the feeding areas inside the Bay and the oceanic waters east of the Bay (15 - 40 km round-trip). By riding the flood and ebb tides {{in and out of the}} Bay, the <b>dugongs</b> could exploit the temperature differential of up to 5 " C between areas. Sometimes they spent as little as 1. 5 hr, during the top of the tide, feeding in the Bay. Some <b>dugongs</b> stayed in the warm water outside the Bay for days at a time in winter. Thirteen <b>dugongs</b> occupied an average range of 64 km 2 during the periods they were satellite-tracked (mean = 50 days). Within their home range, some <b>dugongs</b> sequentially used distinct sub-ranges, in which they concentrated their activities for periods of up to 35 days. Some areas were rarely, if ever used by <b>dugongs,</b> while other areas wer...|$|R
