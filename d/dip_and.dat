5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small <b>dip</b> <b>and</b> into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Angus Smith {{developed}} and patented a product called McDougall's Powder as a sewer deodorant; it was mainly composed from carbolic acid derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a sewage farm. This later led to {{widespread use of}} creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted <b>dip,</b> <b>and</b> drenching tubes {{would be used to}} administer doses to the animals' stomachs to kill internal parasites.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1983 Coalinga earthquake, a blind thrust {{event in the}} central coast ranges of California, a change in {{perspective}} was brought about regarding these types of (concealed) faults. The October 1987 shock occurred on a previously unrecognized blind thrust fault that {{is now known as}} the Puente Hills thrust system. The fault was delineated by the mainshock and aftershock focal mechanisms, fault plane reflection studies, and high resolution seismic profiles, which also revealed that the fault runs from downtown Los Angeles to near Puente Hills. The system {{is considered one of the}} highest-risk faults in the United States due to its moderate <b>dip</b> <b>and</b> its location under a large metropolitan area.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} main types of fault, {{all of which}} may cause an {{interplate}} earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is {{in the direction of}} <b>dip</b> <b>and</b> movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where {{the two sides of the}} fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.|$|E
25|$|Lebanese cuisine is {{influenced}} by other Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy hummus (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean <b>dip),</b> <b>and</b> other bean dishes. Rice is nearly a staple, and pasta is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. Red meat and chicken are common but are usually eaten {{as part of a}} dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Halloween, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. Wine is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France.|$|E
25|$|In {{the league}} that season Bohs were showing good form, though with Glen Crowe {{emerging}} as a phenomenal goal-scorer and Kevin Hunt marshalling the midfield. Once out of Europe, results began to <b>dip,</b> <b>and</b> Collins found himself under pressure. Shelbourne were clear leaders at the top, and a huge investment in the Bohemians playing side looked set to fail to reap just rewards. In January 2001, Collins was under huge pressure as Bohemians travelled to Santry to take on fierce rivals Shamrock Rovers. At half time, Bohemians were trailing the game by 3 goals, as Rovers scored 4 to Bohs 1. It looked certain that a new manager would be appointed following the game. However, {{in one of the}} most remarkable come-backs in Irish football, Bohemians put 5 past a shell-shocked Rovers side in the second half and won 6–4. That result, coupled with a break for several weeks due to the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK and Ireland, gave Bohemians the momentum to mount a late challenge for the league.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{fabrication}} technique, {{a combination}} of slurry <b>dipping</b> <b>and</b> electrospraying, was used to produce hydroxyapatite foams as potential matrices for bone tissue engineering applications. In this study, scaffolds that were slurry <b>dipped</b> <b>and</b> electrosprayed for different time intervals were compared with foams prepared by the individual methods of <b>dipping</b> <b>and</b> electrospraying. Significant differences {{in the distribution of}} cracks on the struts, the strut thickness and porosity were observed on the sintered foams prepared under the varied conditions. All the sintered structures had average porosities in the range 84 - 94 % and desirable pore interconnections, while the combined method produced foams of uniform pore distribution, thicker struts and improved mechanical properties. Further improvement of the mechanical properties has also been achieved by altering the sintering condition...|$|R
25|$|St Andrews {{is made up}} of {{a variety}} of institutions, {{comprising}} three colleges (United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College), the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties. The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population is either a staff member or student of the university. The student body is notably diverse: over 135 nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK; about one-eighth of the students are {{from the rest of the}} EU and the remaining third are from overseas — 15% from North America alone. The university's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions, and the student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May <b>Dip,</b> <b>and</b> the wearing of distinctive academic dress.|$|E
