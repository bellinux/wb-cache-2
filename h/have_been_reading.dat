5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the warmth they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter. Suddenly, he asks if the widows <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
25|$|The Tale of Genji {{was written}} in an archaic court {{language}} that was already unreadable a century after it was written. Thus, the Japanese <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> annotated and illustrated versions of the work since {{as early as the}} 12th century. It was not until the early 20th century that Genji was translated into modern Japanese, by the poet Akiko Yosano.|$|E

25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
500|$|In a Salon article, Krohn was {{critical}} of partisan politics in general, and conservatives in particular, describing his conservative critics as [...] "scorned right-wingers showing all the maturity of a little boy." [...] In an interview with Jian Ghomeshi on CBC Radio subsequent to the Salon article, Krohn pointed out that his critics were so shallow that they claimed he should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> philosophy at only 17 years of age.|$|E
500|$|O. Henry {{alludes to}} the stature of [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] within the buried-treasure genre in his short story [...] "Supply and Demand". One {{character}} learns that the main characters are searching for treasure, and he asks them if they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> Edgar Allan Poe. The title of Richard Powers' 1991 novel The Gold Bug Variations is derived from [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] and from Bach's composition Goldberg Variations, and the novel incorporates part of the short story's plot.|$|E

500|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the novel is}} that it ends too suddenly, without a full exploration of the issues it raises. Mary Rennels, writing in the New York Telegram, said, [...] "Larsen didn't solve the problem [...] Knocking a character out of a scene doesn't settle a matter." [...] An anonymous reviewer for the New York Times Book Review similarly concluded that [...] "the most serious fault with the book is its sudden and utterly unconvincing close"/but otherwise considered it an effective treatment of the topic. On the other hand, Dunbar-Nelson found that the ending confirmed to the reader that [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> a masterpiece all along." ...|$|E
500|$|English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River [...] "a very playful novel": it {{toyed with}} {{character}} and the [...] "fluidity of identity", suggesting that someone may [...] "perform [...] identity rather than be defined by it". Foden said that the whole novel {{could be seen as}} a performance of Irving's own literary identity. More of Irving's [...] "playfulness" [...] manifests itself {{at the end of the}} book when the first sentence of Danny's new book is the same as the first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River—Danny is writing the very book we <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading.</b> And the book cover of a wind-bent pine tree (photographed by Irving's son, Everett) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario.|$|E
500|$|The {{comments}} of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or {{cited in the}} writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together". In another case, writer Ian Maxtone-Graham made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with The Independent, calling them [...] "beetle-browed" [...] and saying, [...] "That's why they're on the Internet and we're writing the show." [...] Writer Bill Oakley used to respond to select Simpsons fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed [...] "here are people who take it seriously to the point of absurdity". In a 1994 Life in Hell cartoon Matt Groening implied that he read the newsgroup.|$|E

500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me. You can hear the original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, Coolbrith's poetry was {{published}} in book form, entitled A Perfect Day, and Other Poems. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, after Coolbrith's publisher sent him a copy, said [...] "I know that California {{has at least one}} poet." [...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It said, simply, [...] "Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced." [...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all who have seen it {{on this side of the}} Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast. He told her [...] "there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{popularity}} of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, {{was one of the few}} women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was [...] "almost subversive" [...] that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, [...] "Since last summer... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> with Her Majesty... There has of course been no question of formal lessons... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody." ...|$|E

500|$|Ben-Hur {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews {{upon its}} release. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, called Ben-Hur [...] "a remarkably intelligent and engrossing human drama". While praising the acting and William Wyler's [...] "close-to" [...] direction, {{he also had}} high praise for the chariot race: [...] "There has seldom been anything in movies to compare with this picture's chariot race. It is a stunning complex of mighty setting, thrilling action by horses and men, panoramic observation and overwhelming use of dramatic sound." [...] Jack Gaver, writing for United Press International, also had praise for the acting, calling it full of [...] "genuine warmth and fervor and finely acted intimate scenes". Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "magnificent, inspiring, awesome, enthralling, {{and all the other}} adjectives you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> about it." [...] He also called the editing [...] "generally expert" [...] although at times abrupt. Ronald Holloway, writing for Variety, called Ben-Hur [...] "a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen," [...] and concluded that [...] "Gone With the Wind, Metro's own champion all-time top grosser, will eventually have to take a back seat." [...] The chariot race [...] "will probably be preserved in film archives as the finest example of the use of the motion picture camera to record an action sequence. The race, directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, represents some 40 minutes of the most hair-raising excitement that film audiences have ever witnessed." ...|$|E

It has regularly published an ideological mixture of op-ed columnists, some of them left-leaning (including E.J.

This country has a tremendous record for socialistic operation, following a socialistic philosophy, and the record shows that their rate of suicide has gone up almost unbelievably and I think they were almost the lowest nation in the world for that.

2500|$|Four {{months after}} the airing of a first episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", the {{newsgroup}} alt.tv.simpsons was created by Gary D. Duzan during {{the third week of}} March 1990. It was created before there was a world wide web, which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms. According to Turner, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. The comments of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or cited in the writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained.
