Medium-speed engines are physically larger than <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> and can burn lower-grade (slower-burning) fuel than <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines.</b> Slow-speed engines are predominantly large two-stroke crosshead engines, hence very different from high- and medium-speed engines. Due to the lower rotational speed of slow- and medium-speed engines, there is more time for combustion during the power stroke of the cycle, allowing the use of slower-burning fuels than <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the fully}} {{developed}} {{forms of the}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine</b> (from around 1900) though, expansion was controlled by governing the timing of a single valve, rather than a separate expansion valve. These led to further complex valve types such as poppet valves, often driven by cam-based valve gears rather than linkages.|$|E
50|$|By the 1840s, it {{was clear}} that the concept had {{inherent}} problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press. However, the arrival of electricity on the scene, and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine,</b> led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s, and a few designs had some limited success.. The Quasiturbine is a new type of uniflow rotary steam engine.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, Belliss and Morcom further {{developed}} the <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine.</b> Their invention in 1890 of the oil pump and forced lubrication system solved {{the problem of the}} bearing rattling under a reversing load. This allowed them to produce double-acting engines that were more compact than single-acting. Where a single cylinder engine could replace a small twin cylinder engine, this was also a useful cost saving. Although some steam generating sets remained in use well into the 1980s, these were almost all of the Belliss and Morcom double-acting type.|$|E

In addition the company produced a range of tractors for both road and agricultural use. Another popular product for municipal use was their lightweight patching roller, used for road repair. In 1924 the company introduced their superb Mann Express wagon, with shaft drive, <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine</b> and fully enclosed cab.

50|$|Fitchburg were notable in also {{supplying}} {{an automatic}} governor (illus., left-hand flywheel) that controlled the valve's cut-off according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 {{with the development}} of the <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine,</b> where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A larger cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as expansion valves to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt governors only controlled a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too.|$|E
50|$|In 1921, E. J. Hall began {{developing}} the valve system of Duesenberg racing engines and developed new cam lobe profiles that improved engines' reliability and power output. His research provided {{an understanding of}} the importance of the gradual opening and closing of valves and the effect this had on valve spring durability in <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines.</b> The designs he specified gave Duesenberg an immediate advantage and were quickly copied and applied to all <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> using poppet valves, which continued to the present day. This work was done in Berkeley, suggesting that Hall may have used his company's resources.|$|R
50|$|His {{career began}} as an {{automotive}} engineer, his qualifications including being a chartered engineer and memberships of both the IMechE and the SAE. He was also the technical editor of Motor World. It is for his technical books that he is best remembered, particularly The <b>High-Speed</b> Two-Stroke Petrol <b>Engine,</b> The Scientific Design of Exhaust and Intake Systems and (edited by L.J.K. Setright) Valve Mechanisms for <b>High-speed</b> <b>Engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lubrication of {{the first}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines,</b> such as the Ideal (an open-crank {{horizontal}} engine), were lubricated by a development of the oil cup systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. Oil cups and multi-point lubricators could oil shaft bearings well enough and a single sight-glass could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines,</b> oilers {{could no longer be}} mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.|$|R
50|$|As speeds increased, the <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine</b> evolved towards its {{developed}} {{form of the}} multi-cylinder {{vertical engine}} with an enclosed crankcase. There was also a tendency to use single-acting pistons. This had two advantages, the lubrication {{could be provided by}} a generous 'splash' system within the crankcase that also helped with cooling, and secondly that the forces in a single-acting engine always act in the same way, as a compression force along the piston rod and connecting rod. This meant that even if a bearing's clearances were relatively slack, the bearing was always held tight. Slack, and thus free-running, bearings could be accepted. An example of such an engine would be the twin-cylinder Westinghouse engines. These engines used a trunk piston, as used for internal combustion engines today, where there is no separate crosshead and the gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is moved up within the piston itself. This provides a very compact layout, but obviously requires a single-acting piston. Interestingly, the main crankshaft bearings of this engine were provided with separate oilers that drained into the crankcase sump. It was recognised that the crankcase oil would become contaminated with water from condensed steam and blow-by from the pistons. A valve was provided for draining this collected condensate off from beneath the oil {{in the bottom of the}} deep sump.|$|E
5000|$|Atkinson's third {{design was}} named the [...] "Utilite Engine". Atkinson {{realized}} an improvement was needed to make his cycle more applicable to a <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine.</b> The final engine produced by the British Gas Engine company was the Utilite Engine. With this design, Atkinson {{was able to make}} a more conventional engine yet preserve the efficiency of having a short compression stroke and a long expansion stroke in a rather ingenious way. It operates much like a standard two-stroke except that the exhaust port is located at about the middle of the stroke. During the expansion stroke, a valve (which remains closed until the piston reaches the end of the stroke) prevents pressure from escaping as the piston moves past the exhaust port. Once the valve is opened, it remains open as the piston heads back toward compression, letting fresh air charge the cylinder and exhaust escape until the port is covered. A rich fuel/air mixture is injected by a small piston pump after the start of compression. This resulted in a two-stroke engine with a short compression and longer expansion stroke. The Utilite Engines tested as even more efficient than Atkinson's previous designs. Very few Utilite Engines were produced, and none is known to survive. The British patent is from 1892, #2492. No US patent for the Utilite Engine is known.|$|E
5000|$|By 1901 Straker were {{building}} an entire wagon [...] This exchanged the previous gear {{drive to the}} rear axle with a chain drive. Although other steam wagons used chain drives, {{this was the first}} to use a single chain, with the differential mounted on the axle rather than the chassis, and with a chain to each wheel. The rear wheels were large in diameter and constructed on the traction engine pattern, with two rows of narrow built-up spokes. As these wheels were too large to fit under the load deck of the wagon, they were mounted outboard of it, requiring an extra-long axle. These wagons were sold by the 'Straker Steam Vehicle Co' with offices at 9 Bush Lane, London and the works in Bristol. They took part in the War Office Trials at Aldershot of 1901, where they were awarded £100, and 1902 By 1902 the rear wheels had been reduced in diameter and now had six broader spokes from a flat sheet: a single sheet for the 2 ton, doubled for the 5 and 7 ton models. The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound, with cylinders of 7" [...] stroke and 4" [...] and 7" [...] diameter. The transmission was relatively crude, using open gears rather than the enclosed oil-bath that was in use amongst other makers, and indeed used for the <b>high-speed</b> <b>engine</b> of their 2-ton light tractor. Two gears were provided, but one was only intended for hill-climbing and could only be selected from alongside the engine, not from the driver's cab.|$|E
50|$|A cheaper {{configuration}} on <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> {{with fewer}} than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump, consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder (functionally analogous to points and distributor cap on an Otto engine).|$|R
50|$|High-speed (approximately 1,000 rpm and greater) {{engines are}} used to power trucks (lorries), buses, tractors, cars, yachts, compressors, pumps and small {{electrical}} generators. As of 2008, most <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> have direct injection. Many modern engines, particularly in on-highway applications, have common rail direct injection, which is cleaner burning.|$|R
50|$|By the 1890s, {{more of the}} Willans type were {{in service}} for {{electricity}} generation than any other type. As with other <b>high-speed</b> steam <b>engines,</b> the need was for a steam engine that ran at sufficiently high speeds to drive dynamos directly and also that had accurate speed regulation under changing load, so as to maintain the correct voltage. Maintaining the correct frequency for AC systems was even more important, but AC systems tended to favour slow-speed engines with large flywheels, rather than the <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines</b> used for DC.|$|R

5000|$|... 'Automatic' engines, {{and in turn}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>engines,</b> {{operated}} {{at increasing}} speeds and required more precise control of their speed under varying load. This required the coupling of their governor to the expansion valve gear. Earlier engines with Watt's centrifugal governor and throttle valve become inefficient when operating at low power.|$|R
50|$|The type YJ or Ventura was {{developed}} in the mid-1950s as Davey, Paxman's first <b>high-speed</b> diesel <b>engine.</b> With a view to the forthcoming modernisation and dieselisation of British Railways, it was intended as a successor to Paxman's existing medium-speed engine, the direct injection YH. <b>High-speed</b> <b>engines</b> offered higher power-to-weight ratios, which in turn allowed locomotives to have a lower axle loading and greater route availability. Their construction and reliable use though required more sophisticated manufacture than previously, with better metallurgy and balancing of the moving parts for faster running and a stiffer crankcase to avoid vibration.|$|R
50|$|These engines were {{produced}} with either simple or compound operating cycles. Smaller examples were usually simple, as {{the difficulties of}} achieving good regulation outweighed the efficiencies of compounding. <b>High-speed</b> <b>engines</b> did develop a reputation for profligacy. For larger engines the fuel cost savings were worthwhile and compound designs such as the Willans engine were used.|$|R
