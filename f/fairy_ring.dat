60|$|VIII. HOW GRUFFANUFF PICKED THE <b>FAIRY</b> <b>RING</b> UP, AND PRINCE BULBO CAME TO COURT.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mother knew}} a way, and next day, {{accompanied}} by Tony (who {{was really quite}} a nice boy, though of course he could not compare), {{they went to the}} Gardens, and Maimie stood alone within a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring,</b> and then her mother, who was a rather gifted lady, said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The fairies are {{exquisite}} dancers, {{and that}} is why {{one of the first things}} the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it. They hold their great balls in the open air, in what is called a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass. It is not there when they begin, but they make it by waltzing round and round. Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring, and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away. The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little people leave behind them, and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates. David and I once found a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> quite warm.|$|E
50|$|The fungus fruits on {{the ground}} in groups or <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests.|$|R
50|$|Attractions {{include an}} annual Halloween bonfire, the Dolmen located in Knockeen, and the <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in Carriglong.|$|R
50|$|Lepista sordida is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} found across the Northern Hemisphere. It is known to form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
60|$|How {{the crowd}} cheered and leapt! Trumpets brayed, the moon came out, and {{immediately}} a thousand couples seized hold of its rays {{as if they}} were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air. And then Maimie went and spoiled everything.|$|E
60|$|The light, {{which was}} as high as your head above the ground, was {{composed}} of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other, and so forming a dazzling canopy over the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> There were thousands of little people looking on, but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them.|$|E
60|$|When the Royal party {{arrived at}} the last stage before you reach Blombodinga, who should be in waiting, in her {{carriage}} there with her lady of honor by her side, but the Princess Angelica? She rushed into her husband's arms, scarcely stopping to make a passing curtsey to the King and Queen. She had no eyes but for Bulbo, who appeared perfectly lovely to her {{on account of the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> which he wore; whilst she herself, wearing the magic rose in her bonnet, seemed entirely beautiful to the enraptured Bulbo.|$|E
50|$|Fruit bodies {{appear from}} August onwards into autumn in {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests, often in profuse numbers. It {{can be found}} in <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tricholoma orirubens {{can also}} form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b> One found in Germany had a {{diameter}} of around 80 m and contained an estimated 10,000 mushrooms.|$|R
500|$|The {{observations}} {{relate to}} trees, seeds, [...] "beans sown by birds", [...] "cucumbers set by bees", {{and a few}} fungi (truffles, Tremella nostoc, and <b>fairy</b> <b>rings).</b>|$|R
6000|$|How {{the crowd}} cheered and leapt! Trumpets brayed, the moon came out, and {{immediately}} a thousand couples seized hold of its rays {{as if they}} were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air. And then Maimie went and spoiled everything. She couldn't help it. She was crazy with delight over her little friend's good fortune, so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy, [...] "Oh, Brownie, how splendid!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you {{not help}} me, good madam?" [...] he entreated. [...] "I {{went down to}} Goody Madge, and she {{said there was a}} chance for me every seven years. The first went by, but this is my fourteenth year. I had a hope when the King spoke of {{beheading}} me, but he was only in jest, as I might have known. Then methought I would try what Midsummer night in the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> would do, but that was in vain; and now you, who could cross me if you would, will not believe. Oh, will you not make the trial?" ...|$|E
60|$|Several {{irregular}} {{spaces are}} enclosed by low iron barriers, {{and in one}} of these the arriving groups of authorized people found other people of their kind, where the unauthorized people seemed by common consent to leave them. There was especially one enclosure which seemed consecrated to the highest comers; it was not necessary that they should make the others feel they were not wanted there; the others felt it of themselves, and did not attempt to enter that especial <b>fairy</b> <b>ring,</b> or fairy triangle. Those within looked as much at home as if in their own drawing-rooms, and after the usual greetings of friends sat down in their penny chairs for the talk which the present kodak would not have overheard if it could.|$|E
5000|$|Shakespeare's {{contemporary}} Thomas Randolph {{speaks of}} <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in his Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry (1638), and Michael Drayton describes one in Nymphidia: The Court of Fairy: ...|$|R
5000|$|Agaricus cupreobrunneus {{tends to}} fruit in {{disturbed}} areas and grassy places, such as lawns, pastures, and roadsides. [...] It can fruit by itself, gregariously, or in <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cortinarius bellus is a {{basidiomycete}} fungus of {{the genus}} Cortinarius native to New Zealand, where it grows under Nothofagus and produces purple mushrooms that can grow in <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly, as {{they stood}} in the shadow, {{they were aware of}} a small, slight, fantastic figure {{in the midst of the}} grass-grown court, where there was a large green {{mushroom}} circle or <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> On the borders of this ring it paused with an air of disappointment. Then entering it stood still, took off the hat, whose lopsided appearance had given so strange an outline, and bowed four times in opposite directions, when, as the face was turned towards the spectators, invisible in the dark shadow, the lady recognised Peregrine Oakshott. She pressed the Doctor's arm, and they both stood still watching the boy bathing his hand in the dew, and washing his face with it, then kneeling on one knee, and clasping his hands, as he cried aloud in a piteous chant-- ...|$|E
60|$|On I went, {{and gained}} {{at last the}} fairy mountain's base, but saw yet no <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> A pasture rose before me. Letting down five {{mouldering}} bars--so moistly green, they seemed fished up from some sunken wreck--a wigged old Aries, long-visaged, and with crumpled horn, came snuffing up; and then, retreating, decorously led on along a milky-way of white-weed, past dim-clustering Pleiades and Hyades, of small forget-me-nots; and would have led me further still his astral path, but for golden flights of yellow-birds--pilots, surely, to the golden window, to one side flying before me, from bush to bush, towards deep woods--which woods themselves were luring--and, somehow, lured, too, by their fence, banning a dark road, which, however dark, led up. I pushed through; when Aries, renouncing me now for some lost soul, wheeled, and went his wiser way.. Forbidding and forbidden ground--to him.|$|E
60|$|And yet in {{that short}} walk between the green turf {{and the yellow}} sands he was destined to find, his hard-headedness {{provoked}} into a not unfamiliar phase which the world was inclined to call hot-headedness. The fact was that the Cornish peasantry, who composed his tenantry and domestic establishment, were far from being people with no nonsense about them. There was, alas! {{a great deal of}} nonsense about them; with ghosts, witches, and traditions as old as Merlin, they seemed to surround him with a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> of nonsense. But the magic circle had one center: there was one point in which the curving conversation of the rustics always returned. It was a point that always pricked the Squire to exasperation, and even in this short walk he seemed to strike it everywhere. He paused before descending the steps from the lawn to speak to the gardener about potting some foreign shrubs, and the gardener seemed to be gloomily gratified, in every line of his leathery brown visage, at the chance of indicating that he had formed a low opinion of foreign shrubs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fairy</b> <b>rings</b> are {{the subject}} of much {{folklore}} and myth worldwideâ€”particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other species}} in the family Osmundaceae, it grows a very large rhizome, with {{persistent}} stipe bases from previous years. It forms small, dense colonies, spreading locally through its rhizome, and often forming <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Theatre lay in {{a meadow}} called the Long Slip. A little mill-stream, {{carrying}} water to a mill two or three fields away, bent round one corner of it, {{and in the middle}} of the bend lay a large old <b>Fairy</b> <b>Ring</b> of darkened grass, which was the stage. The millstream banks, overgrown with willow, hazel, and guelder-rose, made convenient places to wait in till your turn came; and a grown-up who had seen it said that Shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable setting for his play. They were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper--hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope--with them. Three Cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise that one could hear all down the meadow; and the noise of the Mill at work sounded like bare feet running on hard ground. A cuckoo sat on a gate-post singing his broken June tune, 'cuckoo-cuk', while a busy kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream, to the brook which ran on the other side of the meadow. Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass.|$|E
60|$|They {{had slipped}} past the {{southern}} point of Grenada in the night, and were at last within that <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> of islands, on which nature had concentrated all her beauty, and man all his sin. If Barbados had been {{invested in the}} eyes of the newcomers with some strange glory, how much more the seas on which they now entered, which smile in almost perpetual calm, untouched by the hurricane which roars past them far to northward! Sky, sea, and islands were one vast rainbow; though little marked, perhaps, by those sturdy practical sailors, whose main thought was of Spanish gold and pearls; and as little by Amyas, who, accustomed to the scenery of the tropics, was speculating inwardly on the possibility of extirpating the Spaniards, and annexing the West Indies to the domains of Queen Elizabeth. And yet even their unpoetic eyes could not behold without awe and excitement lands so famous and yet so new, around which all the wonder, all the pity, and all the greed of the age had concentrated itself. It was an awful thought, and yet inspiriting, that they were entering regions all but unknown to Englishmen, where the penalty of failure would be worse than death--the torments of the Inquisition. Not more than five times before, perhaps, had those mysterious seas been visited by English keels; but there were those on board who knew them well, and too well; who, first of all British mariners, had attempted under Captain John Hawkins to trade along those very coasts, and, interdicted from the necessaries of life by Spanish jealousy, had, in true English fashion, won their markets at the sword's point, and then bought and sold honestly and peaceably therein. The old mariners of the Pelican and the Minion were questioned all day long for the names of every isle and cape, every fish and bird; while Frank stood by, listening serious and silent.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 60 {{mushroom}} species which can {{grow in the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> pattern. The best known is the edible Scotch bonnet (Marasmius oreades), {{commonly known as the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> champignon.|$|E
50|$|Trooping funnel {{is found}} in mixed woodlands, {{especially}} grassy clearings, in autumn. Often gregarious, it can form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings,</b> and has a complex mycelium. It is abundant and widespread in Europe, and less common in North America.|$|R
5000|$|Paralepista flaccida (also called Clitocybe flaccida, Clitocybe inversa, Lepista flaccida and Lepista inversa, or in English [...] "Tawny Funnel Cap") is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} found across the Northern Hemisphere. It is known to form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{can form}} <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in grassy areas like pastures, {{and is also}} found along roadsides; it {{produces}} fruiting bodies in summer and autumn. It is a saprobic species, and so derives nutrients by decomposing organic matter.|$|R
50|$|One <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> in France {{has been}} {{reported}} at over half a mile in diameter and estimated at 800 years of age. It {{is thought to be}} the largest known <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Marasmius oreades, the Scotch bonnet, is {{also known}} as the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> {{mushroom}} or <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> champignon. The latter names tend to cause some confusion, as many other mushrooms grow in fairy rings (such as the edible Agaricus campestris, the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites, and many others).|$|E

50|$|Clitocybe amarescens is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Tricholomataceae. Widely {{distributed}} in northwestern Europe, it was described as new to science in 1969 by Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja. It fruits in groups or in <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in grasslands.|$|R
50|$|The ivory funnel {{is found}} in grassy {{habitats}} in summer and autumn. Often gregarious, it can form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b> Unfortunately, they often occur in grassy areas where they may be encountered by children or toddlers. This may increase risk of accidental consumption.|$|R
5000|$|This fungus is a saprobe {{growing on}} humus-rich soil, compost or conifer needles from summer to autumn. The flaccida form grows in {{deciduous}} woods and the inversa form under conifers. Often numerous mushrooms [...] "fruit" [...] together {{and it may}} form <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
