Recently, such compressors, whose maximum of discharging pressure is 5. 3 MPa, are also adopted in high temperature NH 3 heat pumps and NH 3 /CO 2 cascade refrigeration system. However, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> twin screw <b>compressors</b> are required to have large capacity, good performance and excellent stability at <b>high</b> operating <b>pressure.</b> In this paper, a semi-empirical model for open-type <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> twin screw <b>compressor</b> is developed.

On the basis of theoretical and experimental research, the performance of the compressor, which includes volumetric efficiency, adiabatic efficiency, discharge temperature and lubricant oil flow rate/temperature, are illustrated.

Consequently, the required Discharge Pressures for Re-Injection Compressors aboard FPSO?s are likely to exceed current 550 bar levels, and requirements for design of higher pressure compressors becomes more severe. This paper presents development of super <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> {{and the results of}} verification tests. Super <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> can be used as re-injection compressor or injection compressor such as in the CCS plant and FPSO. Rotor stability is the most considerable requirement for super high pressure operation because of the high density flow destabilizing force in the compressor. From {{the point of view of}} rotor dynamics, the short bearing span and high shaft diameter are desirable for the stability of the rotor. On the other hand, from the point of view of aerodynamics performance, that rotor arrangement may decrease the performance. Some parametric study was conducted to optimize the boss ratio of compressor stage to get both high rotor dynamic stability and high aerodynamic performance. Rotating stall can be the cause of sub-synchronous vibrations in super high pressure operating condition and it induces narrow operation range. To prevent such situation, vaned diffuser was applied for developed compressor stage and it can also help to reduce the diffuser radius space. Seal leakage flow have large effects on the rotor stability and aerodynamic performance. For this item, the hybrid construction of hole pattern seal and step labyrinth seal was proposed. Hole pattern seal is well known as damping seal for <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor.</b> CFD dynamic analysis and dynamic characteristics test for this hybrid hole pattern seal are introduced under the condition of high density by using hydraulic shaker device. The extensive verification test of developed super <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> were conducted with impeller of optimized boss ratio, vaned diffuser and hybrid honeycomb seal, and has demonstrated the robustness for all field operating condition including molecular weight variation with high aerodynamic performance and small vibration...|$|E

40|$|A three channel {{active control}} system {{is applied to}} an {{operational}} turbofan engine {{in order to reduce}} tonal noise produced by both the fan and <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor.</b> The control approach is the feedforward filtered-x least-mean-square algorithm implemented on a digital signal processing board. Reference transducers mounted on the engine case provides blade passing and harmonics frequency information to the controller. Error information is provided by large area microphones placed in the acoustic far field. In order to minimize the error signal, the controller actuates loudspeakers mounted on the inlet to produce destructive interference. The sound pressure level of the fundamental tone of the fan was reduced using the three channel controller by up to 16 dB over a 60 deg angle about the engine axis. A single channel controller could produce reduction over a 30 deg angle. The experimental results show the control to be robust. Simultaneous control of two tones is done with parallel controllers. The fundamental and the first harmonic tones of the fan were controlled simultaneously with reductions of 12 dBA and 5 dBA, respectively, measured on the engine axis. Simultaneous control was also demonstrated for the fan fundamental and the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> fundamental tones...|$|E

The SPRINT option {{is designed to}} increase efficiency {{and power of the}} turbine, while the water injection, STIG and DLE are for reducing emissions. An alternative form of power augmentation is Evaporative Cooling, which is a water fogging system that sprays a fine mist of water into the inlet air before the air filters.

40|$|LectureThe rotordynamic {{stability}} of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors</b> is strongly {{affected by the}} aerodynamic effects induced by the gas flow through rotor-stator seals. In particular the tangential velocity (swirl) of the gas flowing through the seals is a main destabilizing factor (Childs, 1993) and therefore needs to be minimized. Swirl brakes are well-known devices to reduce the swirl of the leakage at seal inlet, or preswirl. Their effectiveness is function of several geometrical parameters (swirl brake vane dimensions and shape, clearance gap between rotor and stator, seal diameter) and operating parameters (such as rotating speed, gas pressure, temperature, molecular weight, gas swirl upstream of the seal). A CFD study {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the impact of each geometrical parameter on swirl brake performance, starting from a baseline and varying it over a possible design range. The purpose was to identify an optimum design that could achieve a strong preswirl reduction over the widest range of compressor applications, sizes and operating conditions. Swirl brakes developed according to this optimization study were used in a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> centrifugal <b>compressor.</b> The full load test performed in 2013 included a direct measurement of the logarithmic decrement, thus providing useful information to validate the outcome of the analysis. A comparison between calculation and test results allowed to verify the effectiveness of swirl brakes, by quantifying the actual preswirl value obtained from the labyrinth seals...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of rotordynamic coefficients for gas seals is achieved {{with the aid}} of a two-volume bulk flow model based on turbulent rotationally symmetric 3 D flow calculations including swirl flow. Comparison of cross-coupling and damping coefficients with measurements confirm this approach. In particular the theoretically predicted phenomenon that labyrinth damping is retained without inlet swirl is confirmed. This is important for the design of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors,</b> where labyrinth damping is a major contribution improving rotor stability. Discrepancies are found when comparing theory with measured direct stiffness and the cross-coupling damping coefficients. First measurements of labyrinth seals on a recently installed test rig operated with water are presented. Since forces are larger than on test stands operated with air and since individual chamber forces are obtained phenomena like inlet effects may be studied...|$|R
