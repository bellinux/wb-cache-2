With the rapid development of the computer network technology and the electronic commerce, the emergence of e-business provides a new idea to promote the service of agricultural products. A huge supply chain network is established by the new idea and the technology. More and more agricultural products firms establish the <b>electronic</b> <b>sale</b> channel and get great profits. Firstly, we analyze the status of the agricultural products logistics distribution in both traditional sale channel and <b>electronic</b> <b>sale</b> channel in this paper. Then, we summarize the problems appeared in e- commerce channel. To solve these problems, we build an optimization model of the agricultural products distribution in e- commerce channel...|$|E

40|$|Globalization, {{development}} {{of information and}} communication technologies and other trends in the new millennium are changing the approach to consumers. From enterprises is more demanding, despite adapting on time to current needs and demands of consumers, and the ability for anticipating their future changes, especially in demographic structure, expressed through decreased natality and increased average life. In this regard, Internet is emerging as the newest and most important technology for understanding the needs of different demographic segments of customers and offering appropriate products and services. It’s appearance and use resulted in increased role of electronic marketing in relationship with consumers, enabling more direct, faster and more efficient communication between businesses and consumers. Although traditional media (television, print media) are still having big influence on buying decision, the impact of electronic media (social networks, websites) is growing, together with the development and use of the Internet as a medium for advertising and selling. In this paper, through tabular, graphic and computational examinations, will be presented the role of e-marketing in the changing demographic structure of the population, expressed through decreased natality and increased average life.

40|$|This report covers work {{performed}} in Phase II of a two phase project whose {{objective was to}} demonstrate the aggregation of multiple Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and to offer them into the energy market. The Phase I work (DE-FC 36 - 03 CH 11161) created an integrated, but distributed, system and procedures to monitor and control multiple DERs from numerous manufacturers connected to the electric distribution system. Procedures were created which protect the distribution network and personnel that may be working on the network. Using the web as the communication medium for control and monitoring of the DERs, the integration of information and security was accomplished {{through the use of}} industry standard protocols such as secure SSL,VPN and ICCP. The primary objective of Phase II was to develop the procedures for marketing the power of the Phase I aggregated DERs in the energy market, increase the number of DER units, and implement the marketing procedures (interface with ISOs) for the DER generated power. The team partnered with the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), the local ISO, to address the energy market and demonstrate the economic dispatch of DERs in response to market signals. The selection of standards-based communication technologies offers the ability of the system to be deployed and integrated with other utilities’ resources. With the use of a data historian technology to facilitate the aggregation, the developed algorithms and procedures can be verified, audited, and modified. The team has demonstrated monitoring and control of multiple DERs as outlined in phase I report including procedures to perform these operations in a secure and safe manner. In Phase II, additional DER units were added. We also expanded on our phase I work to enhance communication security and to develop the market model of having DERs, both customer and utility owned, participate in the energy market. We are proposing a two-part DER energy market model [...] a utility need business model and an independent energy aggregator-business model. The approach of developing two group models of DER energy participation in the market is unique. The Detroit Edison (DECo, Utility) -led team includes: DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech, DER provider), Electrical Distribution Design (EDD, Virginia Tech company supporting EPRI’s Distribution Engineering Workstation, DEW), Systems Integration Specialists Company (SISCO, economic scheduling and real-time protocol integrator), and OSIsoft (PI software system for managing real-time information). This team is focused on developing the application engineering, including software systems necessary for DER’s integration, control and sale into the market place. Phase II Highlights Installed and tested an ICCP link with SSL (security) between DECo, the utility, and DTE Energy Technologies (DTECH), the aggregator, making DER data available to the utility for both monitoring and control. Installed and tested PI process book with circuit & DER operational models for DECo SOC/ROC operator’s use for monitoring of both utility circuit and customer DER parameters. The PI Process Book models also included DER control for the DECo SOC/ROC operators, which was tested and demonstrated control. The DER Tagging and Operating Procedures were developed, which allowed that control to be done in a safe manner, were modified for required MOC/MISO notification procedures. The Distribution Engineering Workstation (DEW) was modified to include temperature normalized load research statistics, using a 30 hour day-ahead weather feed. This allowed day-ahead forecasting of the customer load profile and the entire circuit to determine overload and low voltage problems. This forecast at the point of common coupling was passed to DTech DR SOC for use in their economic dispatch algorithm. Standard Work Instructions were developed for DER notification, sale, and operation into the MISO market. A software mechanism consisting of a suite of new and revised functionality was developed that integrated with the local ISO such that offers can be made electronically without human intervention. A suite of software was developed by DR SOC enabling DER usage in real time and day-ahead: Generation information file exchange with PI and the utility power flow A utility day-ahead information file Energy Offer Web Service Market Result Web Service Real-Time Meter Data Web Service Real-Time Notification Web Service Registered over 20 DER with MISO in Demand Response Market and demonstrated <b>electronic</b> <b>sale</b> to MISO...|$|E
