25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News {{felt that}} Keys [...] "croons" [...] on the track's chorus line, [...] "I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets {{will make you}} feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you." [...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reviewer}} commented {{about the}} play's score, that [...] "its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines {{that have been}} copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since." [...] Singer and musicologist, Susannah McCorkle writes that the score [...] "meant {{more to me than}} ever, now that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters." [...] Historian and composer Alec Wilder says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was [...] "a profound shock." ...|$|E

6000|$|Therefore we can say, not merely,--I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a God {{made the}} world, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>that</b> God is like. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is not merely}} a great God, a wise God, but a good God; that {{goodness}} is his very essence. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is gracious and merciful, long suffering, and of great kindness. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is loving to every man, and that his mercy is over all his works. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> upholds those who fall, and lifts up those who are down; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> careth for the fatherless and widow, and executes judgment and justice for all those who are oppressed with wrong. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will fulfil the desire of those who call upon him; and will also hear their cry and will help them. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> in short, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a living God, and a loving God; a God in whom men may trust, to whom they may open their hearts, as children to their father: and I am sure that those who come to him he will in no wise cast out; for he himself has said, with human voice upon this earth of ours,--'Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me because I like to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. So <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would do her some justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the success}} of his elder brother's fledgling {{television}} commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, [...] "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!" [...] Scott said, [...] "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre." [...] He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. [...] "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years , and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Larey {{then picked}} up Hollis' pants and pulled out his wallet and told the assailant, [...] "He doesn't have any money." [...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E

[...] "I don't envy Terence a bit. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has quite}} {{deserved}} {{what he has}} got, and that if I had had his start, I should never have got any farther. Still, I wish I could go with him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has always been the}} one who invented our plans. Still, I have had a good idea sometimes." ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed, Mulvaney seemed needlessly anxious; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{looked after}} Ortheris in a fatherly way.|$|E

60|$|So I sat {{and told}} him, ox by ox, cow by cow, and heifer by heifer, forgetting none; and Chaka listened silently {{as one who}} is asleep. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not sleep, for all the while the firelight flickered in his fierce eyes. Also <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did but torment me, or that, perhaps, he would learn of the cattle before he killed me. At length all the tale was told.|$|E
60|$|His tone {{made me feel}} not {{a little}} ridiculous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was looking at me}} sideways, with a sardonic smile.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} he had. I should not have asked unless I had been quite sure. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would tell you {{anything}} of that kind. Well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{never said}} nothing. But he sighed, {{and pretty soon}} he stopped digging, and then for a good little while <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was thinking. Then he says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear miss," [...] said I--I {{was almost}} {{on the point}} of calling her Angelica--"I <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{something}} nearer and dearer than even a brother." ...|$|R
