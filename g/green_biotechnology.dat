40|$|A {{main goal}} of <b>green</b> <b>biotechnology</b> {{is to reduce}} our {{dependence}} on fossil reserves and to increase the use of renewable materials. For this, lignocellulose, which is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, represents the most promising feedstock. The latter is a complex aromatic heteropolymer formed by radical polymerization of guaiacyl, syringyl, and p-hydroxyphenyl units linked by β-aryl ether linkages, biphenyl bonds and heterocyclic linkages. Accordingly, lignin {{appears to be a}} potentially valuable renewable aromatic chemical, thus representing a main pillar in future biorefinery. The resistance of lignin to breakdown is the main bottleneck in this process, although a variety of white-rot fungi, as well as bacteria, have been reported to degrade lignin by employing different enzymes and catabolic pathways. Here, recent investigations have expanded the range of natural biocatalysts involved in lignin degradation/modification and significant progress related to enzyme engineering and recombinant expression has been made. The present review is focused primarily on recent trends in ligninolytic <b>green</b> <b>biotechnology</b> to suggest the potential (industrial) application of ligninolytic enzymes. Future perspectives could include synergy between natural enzymes from different sources (as well as those obtained by protein engineering) and other pretreatment methods that may be required for optimal results in enzyme-based, environmentally friendly, technologies...|$|E

We developed an open-access, user-friendly, bioinformatics tool named FunGene-DB ([URL] The goal was to facilitate the molecular authentication of Polyporales strains and fruit-bodies, otherwise subjected to morphological studies. This tool includes a curated database that contains ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 rDNA genes screened through a semi-automated pipeline from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD), and the similarity search BLASTn program. Today, the web-accessible database compiles 2379 accepted sequences, among which 386 were selected as reference sequences (most often fully identified ITS sequences for which a voucher, strain or specimen, has been deposited in a public-access collection). The restriction of the database to one reference sequence per species (or per clade for species complex) allowed most often unequivocal analysis. We conclude that FunGene-DB is a promising tool for molecular authentication of Polyporales. It should be especially useful for scientists who are not expert mycologists but who need to check the identity of strains (e. g. for culture collections, for applied microbiology) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{affinity}} of microbial {{cells for}} hydrophobic interfaces {{is important because}} it directly affects the efficiency of various bioprocesses, including <b>green</b> <b>biotechnologies.</b> The toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain Tol 5 has filamentous appendages and a hydrophobic cell surface, shows high adhesiveness to solid surfaces, and self-agglutinates. A “bald” mutant of this bacterium, strain T 1, lacks the filamentous appendages and has decreased adhesiveness but retains a hydrophobic cell surface. We investigated the interaction between T 1 cells and an organic solvent dispersed in an aqueous matrix. During a microbial-adhesion-to-hydrocarbon (MATH) test, which is frequently used to measure cell surface hydrophobicity, T 1 cells adhered to hexadecane droplet surfaces in a monolayer, whereas wild-type cells aggregated on the droplet surfaces. The adsorbed T 1 cells on the hexadecane surfaces hindered the coalescence of the droplets formed by vortexing, stabilizing the emulsion phase. Following the replacement of the aqueous phase with fresh pure water after the MATH test, a proportion of the T 1 cells that had adsorbed to the hydrocarbon surface detached during further vortexing, suggesting a reversible adsorption of T 1 cells. The final ratio of the adhering cells to the total cells in the detachment test coincided with that in the MATH test. The adhesion of T 1 cells to the hydrocarbon surface conformed to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which describes reversible monolayer adsorption. Reversible monolayer adsorption should be useful for green technologies employing two-liquid-phase partitioning systems and for bioremediation because it allows effective reaction and transport of hydrophobic substrates at oil-water interfaces...|$|R
40|$|UMR 1332 - Equipe MétabolismeThe {{study of}} plant {{metabolism}} impacts {{a broad range}} of domains such as plant cultural practices, plant breeding, human or animal nutrition, phytochemistry and <b>green</b> <b>biotechnologies.</b> Plant metabolites are extremely diverse in terms of structure or compound families as well as concentrations. This review attempts to illustrate how NMR spectroscopy, with its broad variety of experimental approaches, has contributed widely to the study of plant primary or specialized metabolism in very diverse ways. The review presents recent developments of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional NMR methods to study various aspects of plant metabolism. Through recent examples, it highlights how NMR has proved to be an invaluable tool for the global characterization of sample composition within metabolomic studies, and shows some examples of use for targeted phytochemistry, with a special focus on compound identification and quantitation. In such cases, NMR approaches are often used to provide snapshots of the plant sample composition. The review also covers dynamic aspects of metabolism, with a description of NMR techniques to measure metabolic fluxes – in most cases after stable isotope labelling. It is mainly intended for NMR specialists who would be interested {{to learn more about the}} potential of their favourite technique in plant sciences and about specific details of NMR approaches in this field. Therefore, as a practical guide, a paragraph on the specific precautions that should be taken for sample preparation is also included. In addition, since the quality of NMR metabolic studies is highly dependent on approaches to data processing and data sharing, a specific part is dedicated to these aspects. The review concludes with perspectives on the emerging methods that could change significantly the role of NMR in the field of plant metabolism by boosting its sensitivity. The review is illustrated throughout with examples of studies selected to represent diverse applications of liquid-state or HR-MAS NMR...|$|R
