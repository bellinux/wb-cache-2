5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for the horses used in Vienna.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to Seydlitz <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> difficult to repair, and Scheer was unwilling {{to embark on a}} major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. At noon on 28 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Victoria College {{expelled}} Edward, who <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> a troublesome boy, {{despite being}} {{a student of}} great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation.

5|$|Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of {{the more}} severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall lancet windows and many gables. As his career progressed, and he <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> himself to the {{employing}} authorities, his designs developed into a more European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which {{was in no way}} peculiar to Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as Alfred Waterhouse in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War the Chain Home radar system began to be installed in the south of England, with three radar stations being operational by 1937. Although the German High Command suspected that the British may have been developing these systems, Zeppelin test flights <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> inconclusive. As a result, the expanding Chain Home radar system, and aircraft-based radar first fielded in 1940, became a vital piece of Britain's defensive capabilities during the Battle of Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Balkan {{crisis that}} started with the Serbo-Bulgarian War, coupled with Ottoman naval {{expansion}} in the 1860s and 1870s, prompted the Greek Navy to begin a rearmament program. In addition, the Greek fleet <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> to be too weak to effectively challenge Ottoman naval power during the 1866 Cretan Revolt. In 1885, Greece ordered three new ironclads of the Hydra class. The ships were ordered from the Graville and St. Nazaire shipyards in France during the premiership of Charilaos Trikoupis.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century the British and Venezuelans <b>had</b> <b>proved</b> no more able to reach an agreement, until matters came to a head in 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations.|$|E

The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.|$|E
