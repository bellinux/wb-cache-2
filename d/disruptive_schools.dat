30|$|In {{the case}} of public policy, {{we see in the}} {{governmental}} and institutional discourse the absence of consideration about linking educative models with technological development and the global ecosystem of knowledge production. In general terms, educative innovation initiatives in educative institutions at any level limit themselves to reproducing the narratives and models designed by the agendas of technology corporations, and in a few occasions they consider original pedagogic proposals that contribute to a critical reflection about learning processes in relation to technology. Exceptionally it is possible to find institutional discourses that on a macro level (as is {{the case of}} Uruguay) and micro level (as in some <b>disruptive</b> <b>schools),</b> are interested in framing pedagogic practices and learning in a context that allows to evaluate its influence in the local and global knowledge production systems. Because of this, it is important to highlight that proposals which emphasize the technological dimensions of learning in a network and not its pedagogic dimensions contribute to (or are motivated by) the initiatives of technology corporations that have in the educative institutions and in governments their main clients.|$|E

Text analysis of transcriptions of the interviews suggested that juveniles have four major motivations for remaining in prostitution: financial, emotional, drug, and identity-related factors. Analysis of interviews with juveniles working in confined prostitution suggested four stages of attitude change: resistance, development of interpersonal connections, self-injury and loss of hope, and acceptance of prostitution.

Therefore, {{we used a}} multivariate design to maximize the pre-diction of schizophrenia from premorbid measures and to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} various predictors. Two hundred twelve Danish subjects with at least one parent diagnosed in the schizophrenia spectrum (high risk) and 99 matched subjects with no such parent (low risk) were assessed on 25 pre-morbid variables in seven domains (genetic risk, birth factors, autonomic responsiveness, cognitive functioning, rearing environment, personality, and school behavior) when the subjects averaged 15 years of age. Twenty-five years later, 33 subjects had received lifetime diagnoses of schizophrenia. Discriminant function analyses were used to discrim-inate schizophrenia outcomes from no mental illness and nonschizophrenia outcomes on the basis of pre-morbid measures. Regardless of the comparison group used, schizophrenia was predicted by the interaction of genetic risk with rearing environment, and <b>disruptive</b> <b>school</b> behavior. Within the high-risk group, two-thirds of schizophrenia outcomes were correctly predicted by these premorbid measures; three-quarters of those with no mental illness were also correctly predicted.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} to research <b>disruptive</b> behavior in <b>school</b> environment and different factors that stimulate and support it. In theory I introduce disruptive behavior, as a behavior connected to {{the context in which}} it appears social interaction and communication. I introduce factors that can contribute or reduce appearance of <b>disruptive</b> behavior in <b>school</b> environment. One of them is peer group which is very important for children’s psychosocial development and has a great influence on their behavior. The next factor is school itself. School is an institution that contributes to disruptive behavior with it demands for productiveness, learning, remembering, social conformation, cooperation and ability to resign from momentary wishes, which is easier for some children and harder for others. Teachers are also very important. With their behavior and relationship they can contribute a lot to the level of appearance of disruptive behavior in classroom. Researches suggest that teachers have more problems with behavior that is showed in externalized way, especially with aggressiveness to which I give special focus in this work. I devoted the empirical part of this work to research an example of a boy who is considered by his teachers to be the most disruptive child in his class. Through my own observations, realization of a clay work with a boy and talks with his teachers, I try to find out which of his behaviors are <b>disruptive</b> for <b>school</b> environment and which factors contribute to his behavior. I find out that his school environment is stimulating and he gets special help and attention.

40|$|Background: Pupil {{behaviour}} {{is important}} for academic and social learning in <b>school.</b> <b>Disruptive</b> behaviour conflicts with learning and may cause teachers to experience stress and even burnout. Although some knowledge is available about factors that influence problem behaviour, {{we need to know}} more about what induces and maintains such behaviour in classrooms. Limited research focuses on factors affecting disobedience to teacher. Moreover, pupil behaviour is a complex product of factors related to each individual pupil and the classroom context, such as teacher authority. In addition to considering each factor, prevention and intervention targeting behavioural problems in school must take into account the interplay between all the factors impacting pupils' classroom behaviour. Given this complexity, this thesis attempts to shed light on some relevant elements and connections. Aims: The general aim {{of this study was to}} increase the knowledge and understanding of pupil aggressiveness, discipline problems, some aspects of their relationships and their relationship with teacher authority. The first aim was to conceptualize pupil disobedience to teachers within the field of antisocial behaviour, to develop a scale measuring this concept and to reveal whether reactive and proactive aggressiveness can predict such behaviour. As this disruptive behaviour interferes with the role of the formal leader and the teacher-pupil relationship, it was labelled as disobedience. Next, we studied possible relationships between pupil aggressiveness and perceptual orientation towards weakness in a teacher who is new to them. The aim was to explore whether reactive and/or proactive aggressiveness were related to pupils' perceptual tendency that could make teachers especially vulnerable in the start-up period of new classes. Finally, the third paper aimed to investigate approaches that experienced practitioners presented as effective to turn around highly <b>disruptive</b> <b>school</b> classes that were out of the teachers' control. Because this field is rarely described, we built on practical experience to try to reveal concepts and frameworks that could be useful to describe, analyse and discuss approaches to addressing highly <b>disruptive</b> <b>school</b> classes. In these classes, the teacher(s) had lost control and needed external help to re-establish authority. Based on the cases, we explored the similarities and differences in approaches to turning around hard classes. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative approaches were followed. Papers 1 and 2 built on data from questionnaires that were part of the nationwide regular School environment studies conducted by the Centre for Behavioural Research 1 (CBR). These data were cross-sectional and collected by use of pupil-reported questionnaires. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling with confirmatory factor analyses and structural models. Multi-group analyses were used to test whether gender moderated the structural relationships. Paper 3 presents a qualitative study based on seven cases comprising models for approaches addressing highly disruptive classes. Data came from presentations and discussions during workshops arranged partly for this purpose. The instrumental multi-case study included within-case and cross-case analyses. Informants were experienced practitioners who had worked with turnarounds in highly disruptive classes, and the cases contained the practitioners' accumulated experience in the role as external experts assisting schools. Results: We identified a statistically and theoretically robust concept, i. e., pupil disobedience. It refers to behaviour that the pupil knows interferes with instructions or standards set by the teacher. As hypothesized, the structural models confirmed relationships between all three independent variables, reactive aggressiveness, proactive power-related aggressiveness and proactive affiliation-related aggressiveness, and the dependent variable, disobedience, in both boys and girls. Gender moderated the relationships between aggressiveness and disobedience. In sum, the aggressiveness variables predicted nearly equal amounts of disobedience in boys and girls. However, differences were found when types and subtypes of aggressiveness were considered. Perceptual orientation towards weakness in a new teacher was measured by statements regarding what pupils look for when they are scheduled to meet a new teacher. Both reactive and proactive aggressiveness were related to a perceptual orientation towards weakness. For reactive aggressiveness, the beta values were small, although significant for girls. The more alarming finding was the substantial and significant relationship between proactive aggressiveness and a perceptual orientation towards weakness in a new teacher. Gender did not moderate the relationships between the aggressiveness variables and perceptual orientation. Chronic disruptions, poor learning and teachers who have lost control characterize some school classes. This implies continued ignorance of teachers' instructions and standards. Cases reflecting seven experienced practitioners' approaches to such classes revealed broad homogeneity regarding the issues emphasized. Although this led to a set of common concepts for describing turnarounds, cross-case analyses revealed different ways to handle the common issues. The results showed two main strategies in approaches to highly disruptive classes: One was a cognitive strategy with learning as a powerful tool. The other was a systems strategy with a power take-over on the part of the teacher. These strategies draw a tentative conceptual framework for approaches to highly <b>disruptive</b> <b>school</b> classes. Conclusion: Both proactive and reactive aggressiveness are connected to the likelihood of disruptive pupil behaviour in terms of behaviour that the pupil is aware of conflicts with the standards or instructions given by the teacher. Such behaviour interferes with teacher-pupil relationships and may threaten teacher authority. Another threat to teacher authority may stem from the fact that some pupils are prone to signs of weaknesses when they expect to meet a new teacher. Pupils who score highly on proactive aggressiveness report a perceptual orientation towards signs of weakness in new teachers. Reactive aggressiveness is weakly connected to the same perceptual orientation in girls. Turnarounds in highly disruptive classes imply that the teacher re-establishes authority. A framework of two strategies to approaching such classes include a cognitive strategy focusing on learning and training new behaviour, and a systems strategy focusing on redistributing social power in the classroom...|$|R

40|$|Teacher {{education}} and training are in a crisis in countries like Bangladesh where the State failed to provide basic education for its citizens. Understanding teachers’ lives and school contexts are vey important for exploring teachers’ professional development. This paper is based on three ethnographic case studies of teachers’ lives. In the context of problems and difficulties of everyday life, any simplification fact leads to inappropriate blaming and unrealistic solutions, because it ignores the interrelationship of highly significant factors. The analytic framework {{used in this study}} is from Bronfenbrenner’s (1979, 1992) theoretical work on the ecology of human development to place the teachers at the centre of the research focus. This framework suggests that the development of a person cannot be effectively understood without paying attention to the connections between micro-level (within person), meso-level, exo-level and macro-level factors. Understanding teachers’ professional development from the teachers’ perspective is a means of exploring the validity of Bronfenbrenner’s framework too in this context. The challenge for this kind of study is to develop methods that generate data of sufficient richness and depth. Therefore, data derived from a mixed method research strategy was adopted for the study. This paper has through some lights on teachers’ professional and personal lives as well as their work patterns while they are living in a metropolitan overcrowded chaotic city and working in <b>disruptive</b> <b>school</b> environments.

The study emphasizes the kinds of disruptive behavior that occur during class, and how it manifests itself in the classroom. The study is mainly concerned with issues inside the classrooms, but also moves outside the classroom by addressing everyday disruptions {{in the lives of}} students. The focus is not on causal relationships, but on existential incentives for how students cope with everyday disruptions and <b>disruptive</b> behavior in <b>schools.</b> The dissertation consists of two parts, one extended abstract and four articles. Two of the articles are conceptual explorations and two articles introduce empirical data to the equation. The theoretical articles, written by myself and the following articles are authored together with Professor Liv Duesund. The methodology used to collect the quantitative data is a mixture of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Within the project, there are several master’s theses conducted prior to the work within this dissertation. These consist of observational studies of <b>disruptive</b> behavior in <b>schools,</b> which laid part of the foundation {{for the development of the}} quantitative questionnaire conducted on students in Norwegian and American schools. There is a small research community applying existential philosophy in relation to <b>disruptive</b> behavior in <b>school.</b> This dissertation could serve as a contribution to the field of education due to applying existential philosophy to a familiar phenomenon of students, teachers and researchers within education. The main empirical contribution of this thesis is an utilization of the student perspective to a much larger degree than many other studies of disruptive behavior as well as comparing findings in two countries. The findings document that disruptive behavior is not just an occasional occurrence, but also an everyday phenomenon. Also, such behavior is not only a local issue, but could be an aspect in modern society.

40|$|Full text of {{this article}} is not {{available}} in SOAR. This paper clarifies the relationship of alienation to the period of adolescence by developing a portrait of the alienated and the at-risk adolescent. Current research on adolescent alienation follows two converging themes, the socio-psychological, where deviant behavior is viewed as evidence of adolescent estrangement from self and society, and the sociological, where alienation is divided into a series of dimensions for empirical assessment. These two perspectives converge to describe the alienated adolescent. The alienated adolescent is disruptive, rebukes authority, drops out of school or becomes a passive participant, is prone to suicide, abuses drugs and alcohol, and rejects the norms established by family, school, and society in general. Adolescence is a high-risk period wherein the adolescent experiences multiple environments which exacerbates higher levels of alienation. These environments include disorganized or <b>disruptive</b> families, <b>schools</b> that encourage students to become passive participants in the learning process, and a high-pressured pace of life. To lessen the at-risk nature of adolescents toward alienation, society can take steps to humanize their environment. These steps include the intergenerational integration of adolescents, their assimilation into responsible societal activities, providing them with a sense of meaning, and enfranchisement into the decision-making process...|$|R

Skulduggery tells Stephanie how Gordon once described her as [...] "strong-willed, intelligent, sharp-tongued, doesn't suffer fools gladly", traits Gordon himself possessed. Stephanie proves herself to have all these qualities in spades, clashing wits with Skulduggery and annoying him to no end. She refuses to be left behind by Skulduggery when they first meet, despite his advice that she keep out of danger. He later comes to respect her abilities, recognizing them when she herself does not. Stephanie despised her boring, ordinary life; she did not have anything in common with her peers and though not <b>disruptive</b> at <b>school,</b> has a healthy disregard for authority. She takes great enjoyment in Skulduggery's more criminal escapades, such as breaking into a museum vault. She constantly proves herself to be every bit the equal of the adults, though some people underestimate her - her pet peeve is being called [...] "child".|$|R
