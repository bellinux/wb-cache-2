50|$|Aeromonas salmonicida is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, nonmotile bacterium. It is rod-shaped, about 1.3-2.0 by 0.8-1.3 μm in size, {{and grows}} optimally at {{temperatures}} between 22 and 25 °C. The bacterium readily ferments and oxidizes glucose, and is catalase- and cytochrome oxidase-positive.Its molecular properties include a special surface protein array called the A-layer, which {{is believed to}} be responsible for the bacterium's virulent traits, and lipopolysaccharide, the cells' major cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen.</b> The A-layer consists of a 50-kD protein, and provides protection to the bacterium. The lipopolysaccharide consists of three moieties: lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-polysaccharide (O-antigen). The extracellular products of A. salmonicida consist of 25 proteins, enzymes, and toxins, and many more. In addition, the genome is composed of a single circular chromosome (4,702,402 bp), with two large and three small plasmids. The chromosome yields 58.5% of G+C pairs, has 4086 encoding proteins, and totals 4388 genes.|$|E

BackgroundIgA nephropathy {{is the most common}} form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. We previously reported a novel form of glomerulonephritis with glomerular IgA deposits following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. We investigated the role of S. aureus related antigens in the immunopathogenesis of IgA nephropathy by producing several monoclonal antibodies against S. aureus surface antigens and determining the epitopes of deposited antigens in patients with IgA nephropathy. MethodsCell membrane proteins were isolated from cultured S. aureus. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against these proteins were generated, and their target epitopes were determined by antibody affinity chromatography and amino acid sequence analysis, and by monoclonal antibody screening of Escherichia coli clones transfected with plasmids from the Lambda S. aureus Genomic Library. Renal biopsy specimens from 116 patients with IgA nephropathy and 122 patients with other forms of renal disease were examined for glomerular antigen depositions by immunofluorescence microscopy. ResultsThe major antigen recognized by monoclonal antibodies against S. aureus cell membrane was identified as the S. aureus cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> designated ‘probable adhesin’ (ACCESSION AP 003131 - 77, Protein ID; BAB 41819. 1). In 68. 1 % (79 / 116) of renal biopsy specimens from patients with IgA nephropathy, S. aureus cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> was localized in the glomeruli, and the data confirmed that S. aureus cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> was co-localized with IgA antibody in the glomeruli.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{expression}} of endogenous retroviral env pro-ducts on primary leukemia cells of mice was studied {{with the use}} of a panel of monoclonal antibodies that discriminate between the various classes of murine leukemia viruses [MuLVs; ecotropic, xenotropic, and mink cell focus-forming (MCF) ]. as well as between various subtypes within each class. Most spontaneous AKR or Friend MuLV (F-MuLV) - or Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) -induced AKR or NFS mouse leukemia cells expressed no xeno-tropic viral <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> but always expressed MCF proteins. Spontaneous C 58 lymphomas, on the other hand, often expressed xenotropic proteins in addition to MCF proteins. The subtype of MCF <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> present on leukemia cells, as well as on isolated MCF viruses, varied in a reproducible manner, depending on the mouse strain inoculated and the ecotropic virus used (F-MuLV or M-MuLV).

40|$|Virulent Yersinia pestis {{was grown}} on heart {{infusion}} blood agar and examined by scanning electron microscopy, exposing the fraction 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> on cell surfaces as a lumpy coating that {{spilled into the}} surrounding milieu. The amount of antigen depended on both the duration and temperature of incubation. Comparison of the cultures grown at 37 degrees C for 24, 48, and 72 h with those grown at 22 degrees C for identical periods demonstrated that the antigen increased in amount with the length of incubation, and that the overall production of antigen was much greater of 37 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. These experiments visually confirmed the findings of our previous immunological studies. Moreover, we established that the closely related, virulent organism Y. pseudotuberculosis bears no such antigenic coating at any temperature or incubation period. In addition, the emergence of multiple flagella was noted when Y. pseudotuberculosis was grown at 22 degrees C in a liquid medium, whereas Y. pestis remained without these organelles. These observations preceptibly corroborated the absence of fraction 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> {{and the presence of}} flagella, respectively, for distinguishing Y. pseudotuberculosis from Y. pestis...|$|E
40|$|Immunization of mice with heavily {{irradiated}} syngeneic Moloney lymphoma cells evokes antibodies {{against the}} major viral <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen,</b> gp 71, and the Moloney virus-induced cell surface antigen (MCSA). A 9 HT cells, an L-cell subline, react with the antibodies against the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>antigen</b> only; this reaction can be completely inhibited by virus or purified gp 71. Reactivity to Moloney lymphoma cells (YAC) was only partially inhibited (maximum 30 %) {{or not at}} all. This {{can be attributed to}} the reaction of the YAC cells with antibodies directed against MCSA, a nonvirion cell surface component according to both biological and biochemical evidence. Antibody-induced capping of gp 71 or p 15 (E) did not change the membrane distribution of MCSA or H- 2, indicating that these antigens represent distinct entities on the cell surface. MCSA showed only minimal capping and thereby differed in behavior from both H- 2 and virion antigens. gp 71 could be capped by the mouse antiserum as revealed by subsequent staining with monospecific anti-gp 71 antiserum. Under ordinary test conditions this reactivity is overshadowed by the reaction against MCSA. The lack of MCSA capping reflects a difference in anchorage of this antigen...|$|E

40|$|Post-dysenteric or {{reactive}} arthritis (ReA) is {{closely associated with}} HLA-B 27. This histocompatibility antigen is heterogeneous and consists of 2 serologically defined variants: B 27 M 1 +M 2 + and B 27 M 1 +M 2 -. This paper gives a qualitative evaluation of the antibodies present in the sera of 62 patients with dysentery due to Shigella flexneri 2 a, a known arthritogenic bacterium. The patients were classified in 4 groups: B 27 M 1 +M 2 +ReA+ (n = 5), B 27 M 1 +M 2 +ReA- (n = 7); B 27 M 1 +M 2 -ReA- (n = 1); B 27 -ReA- (n = 49). The isolated infectant possessed cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> with B 27 M 2 -like epitopes (Mr 20, 000). Analysis of the spectrum of antibodies directed against the separated cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> of S. flexneri in the sera of these patients revealed 7 main patterns of reactivity. The detectable immunogens encompassed protein stainable antigens (Mr 98, 78, 68, 54, 50, 44, 41, 35, 14 and 13 kDa), lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycan. None of the sera possessed detectable antibodies to the B 27 M 2 -like antigen. Consequently, this antigen {{is unlikely to be}} associated with ReA, and this applies equally to other antigens or patterns of antigens. The arthritogenicity of S. flexneri may therefore not be determined by {{the presence or absence of}} detectable antibody titers to certain cell <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens.</b> We hypothesize that other properties of these antigens could be of significanc...|$|R

40|$|In vitro studies {{indicate}} that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are cytopathic for T 4 + peripheral blood lymphocytes and for most continuous lines of T 4 + lymphocytes.

We report that HIV infections killed cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes and a line of T 4 +-lymphoid cells (CEM cells) without causing cell fusion. We also report that the occurrence of syncytia is an early and transitory phenomenon following infection of a fusion-susceptible line of T 4 +-cells (H 9 cells). Mixing experiments and flow cytometry have been used to demonstrate that susceptibility to HIV-induced fusion is not determined by differences in presentation of viral <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> or the surface levels of T 4 receptor antigens on fusion-susceptible and -resistant cells.

40|$|Capsid, envelope, and nonvirion-associated soluble {{components}} of type 1 and type 2 {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) were obtained from infected monolayer cell cultures and used as complement fixation (CF) antigens. Capsids were prepared by treatment of cells with the nonionic detergent Nonidet-P 40, envelope material by treatment of virions with ether and high pH, and soluble components were obtained from culture fluids of untreated cells. Serological studies with experimental anti-herpesvirus sera indicate that these serotypes share cross-reacting envelope, capsid, and soluble antigens {{with each other and}} with herpesvirus B but not with varicella virus. In addition, animals immunized with crude HSV preparations contain high levels of CF antibody (1 : 32 to 1 : 64) to soluble antigens, whereas sera from humans who have experienced natural infection contain low levels of antibody (≤ 1 : 8) to this antigen. Further testing with reference, capsid, and <b>envelope</b> <b>antigens</b> indicates that antibody levels to reference and capsid antigens are about the same in sera from healthy humans, whereas antibody to the envelope is decidedly lower in these sera.

Cell surface receptors for HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 were found on nonlymphoid cells of human and mammalian origin. Neutralizing antibodies specific to VSV(HTLV- 1) were found in sera of ATLL patients in titers varying from 1 : 50 to 1 : 30, 000 and did not correlate closely with antibody titers for internal viral antigens.
