5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} {{the inclusion of a}} short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of black}} and white is {{regarded}} as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White.</b> Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E
