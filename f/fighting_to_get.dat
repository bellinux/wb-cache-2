25|$|The C$245 million {{expressway}} {{was built}} through the Red Hill Valley by the City of Hamilton after a decades-long battle with opponents. The expressway was first {{proposed in the}} 1950s and was cancelled and resurrected several times. Last-ditch efforts by opponents, including occupying the valley, lawsuits and blocking construction access, failed and the expressway was finally constructed in the 2000s, opening to traffic in 2007. The cost to the city included $100 million in construction costs, plus legal costs <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the expressway constructed. The city fought the provincial government once {{and the federal government}} twice to build the project. As of November 2009, a $75 million lawsuit is still pending with the federal government.|$|E

The paper did not identify the drug nor the source of the information. Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, told The Associated Press he had no comment on the report. Rich Levin, commissioner Bud Selig's office spokesman, {{declined to comment on the}} situation, claiming that MLB did not have a copy of the test results. Michael Weiner, the union general counsel, also declined comment. The union, while <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the list back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|E

He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E

Although Patton and Allen frequently argued and even insulted each other, particularly when discussing tactics and leadership styles, the former recognized Allen's competence in building a fighting division. When Patton heard General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, deliver a lecture on the 'poor discipline' of Allen's 1st Division, Patton contradicted him: [...] "I told him he was mistaken and that anyhow no one whips a dog before putting him into a fight." [...] Nor did personalities dissuade Patton from <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the 1st Infantry Division to carry out the Gela landings in Sicily, which he had correctly surmised would be the most difficult of the Allied assault landings in Sicily.

But the Misi and Cactus, unable to get clear of each other, went ashore on the atoll {{half a mile from}} the passage. The wind merely increased on itself and continued to increase. To face the full blast of it required all one's strength, and several minutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man to exhaustion. Hermann, with his Kanakas, plodded steadily, lashing and making secure, putting ever more gaskets on the sails. The wind ripped and tore their thin undershirts from their backs. They moved slowly, as if their bodies weighed tons, never releasing a hand-hold until another had been secured. Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly horizontal, and, when a whipping gave, the loose end frazzled and blew away.|$|E
