40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{more evidence that}} the wage differential is far smaller than is suggested by simple comparison of gross wages of <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers. It is noted that to obtain a more reasonable measure of the <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> wage differential, {{it is necessary to}} adjust for differences in workers' characteristics, labour market conditions and sample selection. It is found that, in general, <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers exhibit different personal characteristics. In particular, full-time workers possess more human capital and experience than part-timers. Also, labour market conditions such as unions and pension plans favour full-timers. These differences may partly account for the wage disparity between <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers. It was noted that the nonrandomness of the workers into <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> jobs influences the wage determination of both <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers. The results indicate that the adjustment of the wage equations to reflect the above mentioned differences reduces the national wage differential between <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers by 10 %. The reduction is even larger across regions and industries. Another finding was that the wage determination processes between <b>full-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> workers do differ. ...|$|R
