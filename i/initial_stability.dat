5|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> may allow immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading poses {{a higher risk of}} implant failure than conventional loading.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{conservative}} in nature, especially {{when compared to}} the contemporary Nelson-class battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet overall) hull was flush decked and with a high freeboard, and was strongly built. This afforded high <b>initial</b> <b>stability,</b> which contributed to the protection scheme. The machinery spaces followed the traditional layout of boiler rooms ahead of engine rooms, separated by an amidships magazine. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design was handsome, but somewhat impractical in terms of utilisation of internal space.|$|E

30|$|A pig's ilium {{was used}} as the implant {{placement}} site. The implants used in this study were two kinds of diameters (3.8  mm, 5.0  mm) and two kinds of lengths (7.0  mm, 12.0  mm) having a general threadlike shape with a mechanically polished surface. To measure the bone density and the cortical thickness around the implants accurately, the CBCT scanning was performed immediately just after the formation of the implant cavity. The <b>initial</b> <b>stabilities</b> were evaluated by the ITVs and the ISQ values. The bone density and cortical thickness around the implants were measured by an implant simulation software (Landmarker ver. 5.0 with special specifications for this study). The relationships of the thickness of the cortical bone and the voxel values with the ITVs and the ISQ values were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. To evaluate the influence on the ITVs and the ISQ values among multiple factors, multiple regression analysis was performed. P[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern dories {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional dories and {{compensate for the}} lack of <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{currency}} peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 to the US dollar in April 2008. The ringgit had also enjoyed a period of appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) (from 0.49 to 0.44 to the MYR) and the renminbi (CNY) (0.46 to 0.45 to the MYR) as recently as May 2008. The <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce {{the currency}} to foreign trading. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the move will help the economy, with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{of these}} chine hulls {{has its own}} unique {{characteristics}} and use. The flat bottom hull has high <b>initial</b> <b>stability</b> but high drag. To counter the high drag [...] hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth,fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are [...] more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a Vshape between 6and 23degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep Vform (between 18and 23degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.|$|E

40|$|Cementless {{fixation}} {{in total}} knee replacement has enjoyed limited {{success in the}} past; however, there is {{a renewed interest in}} cementless fixation, which has the potential to increase operative efficiency and to improve the strength of the bone-implant interface. The <b>initial</b> mechanical <b>stability</b> of cementless implants is critical to minimizing micromotion between the bone and the porous-coated surface, thus providing the necessary conditions for successful osseointegration (long-term bonding between the bone and implant).

5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability.
