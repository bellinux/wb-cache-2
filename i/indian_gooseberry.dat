50|$|In India, {{a variety}} of herbs and their {{extracts}} were used as shampoos since ancient times. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (aamla) {{and a few other}} herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, is called Ksuna (Sanskrit: क्षुण) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant. The extract of soapberries, a tropical tree widespread in India, creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: फेनक). It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), soapnuts (Sapindus), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara). Guru Nanak, the founding prophet and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in 16th century.|$|E
50|$|Four main {{types of}} {{vegetation}} exist in this park. These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Based on Landsat data for 1986, percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.There {{is a difference}} in altitude between the eastern and western areas of the park, with the western side being at a lower altitude. The western reaches of the park are dominated by grasslands. Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds. Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores, and controlled burning maintain and fertilize the grasslands and reeds. Common tall grasses are sugarcanes, spear grass, elephant grass, and the common reed. Numerous forbs are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including kumbhi, <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> the cotton tree (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).|$|E
5000|$|The name Thirunelli {{derives from}} the nelli, the Tamil/Malayalam and Kannada word for <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry</b> of the Amla tree. Veda vyasa wrote the 18 {{existing}} Puranas.

[...] According to tradition, Lord Brahma was traveling round the Universe on his hamsa, when he became attracted by the beauty of the area now known as Brahmagiri Hill. Descending on that spot, Brahma noticed an idol, set in an Amla tree. Brahma recognized the idol as Lord Vishnu Himself and the place as Vaikuntha (Vishnuloka) itself. With the help of the Devas, Brahma installed the idol and called it Sahyamalak Kshetra. At Brahma’s request Vishnu promised that the waters of the area would wash away all sins. (Thus, the spring and river near the temple is called Papanasini: “washes away all sins”).|$|E
5000|$|Tang alchemists {{were well}} aware of elixir poisoning. The c. 8th-9th century Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe 真元妙道要略 (Synopsis of the Essentials of the Mysterious Dao of the True Origin) lists 35 common {{mistakes}} in elixir preparation: cases where people died from eating elixirs made from cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver; cases where people suffered from boils on the head and sores on the back by ingesting cinnabar prepared by roasting together mercury and sulphur, and cases where people became seriously ill through drinking melted [...] "liquid lead" [...] (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). The c. 850 Xuanjie lu 玄解錄 (Record of Mysterious Antidotes)—which is notable as the world's oldest printed book on a scientific subject—recommends a potent herbal composition that serves both as an elixir and as an antidote for common elixir poisoning (Needham and Ho 1970: 335). The procedure to make Shouxian wuzi wan 守仙五子丸 (Five-herbs Immortality-safeguarding Pills) is to take 5 ounces each of <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> wild raspberry, dodder, five-flavor berry, and broadleaf plantain and pound them into flour. Mix it with boxthorn juice and false daisy juice and dry. Heat almonds and good wine in a silver vessel, and add foxglove, tofu, and [...] "deer glue". Combine this with the five herbs, and dry into small pills. The usual dosage is 30 pills a day taken with wine, but one should avoid eating pork, garlic, mustard, and turnips when taking the medicine (Needham and Ho 1970: 335).|$|E
40|$|Fish oils are {{becoming}} important {{due to their}} nutritional implementations. Development of rancidity in fish oils is very fast and leads to reduction of the qualities of fish oils as well as fish. Prevention of development of rancidity in fish oils by the fruit of <b>Indian</b> <b>Gooseberry</b> (Phynanthus emblica) extracts was studied in detail. The ethanolic, methanolic and water extracts of <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry</b> were applied to fish oils and {{the activity of the}} different extracts was determined by measuring peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid value (FFA) and fatty acid composition (FAC) on eight occasions over forty four days of storage at room temperature (30 °C). In the second experiment, active components of the ethanol extract were separated by hexane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water, and the activity of these fractions were also measured by applying to fish oils. In the first experiment, the ethanolic extract treatment recorded the highest activity in prevention of formation of peroxides, free fatty acids, and the conversion of fatty acids than the methanolic and water extracts. The amount of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased during the storage. The water extract treatment showed the lowest while the methanolic extract was intermediate. Results from the second experiment showed that the antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate fraction was higher than the other solvent fractions used in the study and this indicated that the active compounds might have a medium polarity. The study suggests the possibility of using <b>Indian</b> <b>gooseberry</b> to prevent rancidity of fish oils in industrial uses...|$|E
