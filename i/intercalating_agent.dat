40|$|The {{combination}} of ethidium monoazide (EMA) and post-fragmentation, randomly primed DNA amplification technologies {{will enhance the}} analytical capability to discern viable from non-viable bacterial cells in spacecraft-related samples. <b>Intercalating</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been widely used}} since the inception of molecular biology to stain and visualize nucleic acids. Only recently, <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents</b> such as EMA have been exploited to selectively distinguish viable from dead bacterial cells. Intercalating dyes can only penetrate the membranes of dead cells. Once through the membrane and actually inside the cell, they intercalate DNA and, upon photolysis with visible light, produce stable DNA monoadducts. Once the DNA is crosslinked, it becomes insoluble and unable to be fragmented for post-fragmentation, randomly primed DNA library formation. Viable organisms DNA remains unaffected by the <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents,</b> allowing for amplification via post-fragmentation, randomly primed technologies. This results in the ability to carry out downstream nucleic acid-based analyses on viable microbes to the exclusion of all non-viable cells...|$|R

However, bio-AT7519 produced weaker Chem-seq signals compared to those observed for bio-JQ1. There was also {{a substantial number of}} loci that were not co-occupied by bio-AT7519 and its target CDK9 which might be attributed to the weaker signal obtained for bio-AT7519 or because AT7519 can bind and inhibit other cyclin-dependent kinase like cdks 1, 2, 4, 5. In a third experiment, Chem-seq was efficient in mapping genomic binding sites of the DNA <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent</b> psoralen and showed that bio-psoralen preferentially binds to the transcription start site of active genes.|$|E

The well-crystallized kaolinite is conducive to intercalation by potassium acetate. A higher concentration of <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent</b> (â‰¥ 30 %) can complete the intercalation in a short time (< 12 h), but at lower concentrations intercalation took significantly longer (â‰¥ 144 h).

40|$|Immature CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes {{rearrange}} their T {{cell receptor}} (TCR) -Î± gene locus to generate clonotypic Î±/Î² TCR, after which a few cells expressing selectable TCR are signaled to further differentiate into mature T cells. Because of requirements for self-tolerance, immature CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes are programmed {{to die in}} the thymus in response to a variety of stimuli that do not induce death of mature T cells. We now demonstrate that, in contrast to all previously described stimuli, immature CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes are selectively more resistant than mature T cells to apoptotic death induced by DNA <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents.</b> Importantly, we demonstrate that DNA <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents</b> induce double-stranded DNA breaks in both immature thymocytes and mature T cells, but immature thymocytes tolerate these DNA breaks, whereas mature T cells are signaled to die by an Atm-dependent but p 53 -independent death mechanism. Thus, our results indicate that absence of an Atm-dependent but p 53 -independent pathway allows immature thymocytes to survive double-stranded DNA breaks. It is likely that the unique ability of immature thymocytes to survive DNA-damaging <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents</b> reflects their tolerance of double-stranded DNA breaks that occur normally during antigen receptor gene rearrangements...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} anti-messenger oligodeoxynucleotides, covalently {{linked to an}} <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent,</b> on {{translation}} of rabbit beta-globin mRNA, were investigated both in wheat germ extract and in microinjected Xenopus oocytes. A specific inhibition of beta-globin synthesis was observed in both expression systems with a modified 11 -mer covalently linked to an acridine derivative. In injected oocytes a more efficient block was observed with this modified oligonucleotide than with its unsubstituted homolog. This was ascribed to stacking interactions of the <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent</b> with base pairs which provide an additional stabilization of the [mRNA/DNA] hybrid. We demonstrated that in wheat germ extract, the modified and unmodified oligonucleotides behaved similarly due {{to the presence of}} a high RNaseH activity.

40|$|Base-pair {{sequences}} in double-stranded DNA can {{be recognized}} by homopyrimidine oligonucleotides that bind to the major groove at homopurine. homopyrimidine sequences thereby forming a local triple helix. To make oligodeoxynucleotides resistant to nucleases, we replaced the natural (beta) anomers of the nucleotide units by the synthetic (alpha) anomers. The 11 -mer alpha oligodeoxynucleotide 5 '-d(TCTCCTCCTTT) - 3 ' binds to the major groove of DNA in an antiparallel orientation {{with respect to the}} homopurine strand, whereas a beta oligonucleotide adopts a parallel orientation. When an <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent</b> was attached to the 3 ' end of the alpha oligodeoxynucleotide, a strong stabilization of the triple helix was observed.

A restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA at the junction of the homopurine. homopyrimidine sequence was inhibited by triple-helix formation. The 16 -mer alpha oligodeoxynucleotide substituted by an <b>intercalating</b> <b>agent</b> was approximately 20 times more efficient than the unsubstituted oligomer.

A meaning full effect was observed when the temperature was increased from ambient up to 150 Â°C in case of both <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents.</b> Increasing temperature beyond 150 Â°C caused a decline in surface area generation even up to 750 Â°C. The results also show that mixing ratio has a positive effect on the porosity and the micropore surface area inereases as the mixing ratio inereases in case of both <b>intercalating</b> <b>agents.</b> The influence of holding time shows two different trends.
