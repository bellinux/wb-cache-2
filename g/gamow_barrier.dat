40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Faddeev {{integral}} equations method and the Watson- Feshbach concept of the effective (optical) interaction potential, the first fully consistent three-body approach to the description of the penetration of a charged particle through the Coulomb field of a two-particle bound complex (composed of one charged and one neutral particles) has been developed. A general formalism has been elaborated and on its basis, to a first approximation in the Sommerfeld parameter, the influence of the nuclear structure on the probability of the penetration of a charged particle (the muon, the pion, the kaon and the proton) through the <b>Gamow</b> <b>barrier</b> of a two-fragment nucleus (the deuteron and the two lightest lambda hypernuclei, lambda hypertriton and lambda hyperhelium- 5, has been calculated and studied.
