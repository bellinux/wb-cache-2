25|$|Improvements in {{computing}} technology keep {{increasing the}} rate at which guessed passwords can be tested. For example, in 2010, the Georgia Tech Research Institute developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords much faster. Elcomsoft invented the usage of common graphic cards for quicker password recovery in August 2007 and soon filed a corresponding patent in the US. As of 2011, commercial products are available that claim the ability to test up to 112,000 passwords per second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor. Such a device will crack a 6 letter single-case password in one <b>day.</b> <b>Note</b> that the work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs. Special key stretching hashes are available that take a relatively long time to compute, reducing {{the rate at}} which guessing can take place. Although it is considered best practice to use key stretching, many common systems do not.|$|E

2500|$|The Saros dial is {{the main}} lower spiral dial on {{the rear of the}} mechanism. The Saros cycle is 18 years and [...] days long (6585.333… days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of {{repetition}} of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them— not only the month, but the day and time of <b>day.</b> <b>Note</b> that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read: ...|$|E
2500|$|As Barks blossomed creatively, his {{marriage}} to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that {{he could feel his}} creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are {{in the collection of the}} Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art. During her lifetime, and to this <b>day,</b> <b>note</b> cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story [...] "Christmas in Duckburg", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.|$|E

Syndic Gutzmar and the Authorities came out, in grand coaches, at 8 in the morning; had to wait awhile; the King, having ridden away to look after his {{manifold}} affairs, did not get back till 10. Town Guard and Garrison are all drawn out; Gates all flung open, Prussian sentries withdrawn from them, and from the Excise-houses they had seized: King's Kitchen-and-Proviant Carriages (four mules to each, with bells, with uncommonly rich housings): King's Body-Coach very grand indeed, and grandly escorted, the Thirty Body-guards riding ahead; but nothing in it, only a most superfine cloak [...] "lined wholly with ermine" [...] flung upon the seat. Other Coaches, more or less grandly escorted; Head Cup-bearers, Seneschals, Princes, Margraves:--but where is the King? King had ridden away, a second time, with chief Generals, taking survey of the Town Walls, round {{as far as the}} ZIEGEL-THOR (Tile-Gate, extreme southeast, by the river-edge): he has thus made the whole circuit of Breslau;--unwearied in picking up useful knowledge, [...] "though it was very cold," [...] while that Procession of Coaches went on.|$|E

6000|$|It appears, this loose young gentleman, {{standing}} in no favor with his sovereign Father, had never yet been across to England, the royal Parent preferring rather {{not to have}} him in sight; and was living idle at Hanover; very eager to be wedded to Wilhelmina, as one grand and at present grandest resource of his existence. It is now May, 1728; and Frederick Duke of Edinburgh is twenty-one. He writes to his Aunt and intended Mother-in-law, Queen Sophie (date not ascertainable to a <b>day,</b> <b>Note</b> burnt as soon as read): [...] "That he can endure this tantalizing suspense no longer; such endless higgling about a supreme blessedness, virtually agreed upon, may be sport to others, but is death to him. That he will come privately at once, and wed his Wilhelmina; and so make an end; the big-wigs to adjust it afterwards as they can and may." [...] Whereupon Sophie Dorothee, gladdest of women, sends for Dubourgay the British Ambassador (Brigadier Dubourgay, the respectable old gentleman who spells ill, who is strong for the Double-Marriage always), {{to tell him what}} fine news there is, and what answer she has sent. Respectable Dubourgay stands silent, with lengthening face: [...] "Your Majesty, how unfortunate that I of all men now hear it! I must instantly despatch a courier with the news to London!" [...] And the respectable man, stoically deaf to her Majesty's entreaties, to all considerations but that of his evident duty, [...] "sends the courier" [...] (thinks Pollnitz);--nips thereby that fine Hanover speculation in the bud, sees Prince Fred at once summoned over to England, and produces several effects. Nearly the whole of which, on examining the Documents, [Dubourgay's Despatches (1728: 29 May, 1 June, 5 October), in the State-Paper Office here.] proves to be myth.|$|E
