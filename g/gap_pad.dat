40|$|Thermal {{interface}} materials (TIMs) {{are used}} to reduce the interfacial thermal resistance between the chip and the heat sink, {{which has become a}} bottleneck to heat removal in a variety of electronic applications. Degradation in thermal performance of the TIM can contribute to unacceptably high chip temperatures, which can significantly impact device or system performance during operation. While {{progress has been made in}} recent years in the development of tools to measure beginning-of-life thermal performance, characterizing the long-term performance of the TIM can be crucial from a life cycle stand point since TIMs may experience harsh operating conditions, including high temperature and high humidity, for extended periods of time in typical applications. The laser flash method is one approach for measuring thermal conductivity that has an advantage over more commonly used techniques because of the non-contact nature of the measurement. This technique was applied to 3 -layer structures to investigate the effects of thermal cycling and elevated temperature/humidity on the thermal performance of select polymer TIMs in pad form, as well as an adhesive and a gel. While most samples showed little change (less than 10 % in thermal resistance) or slight improvement in the thermal performance, one thermal putty material showed degradation due to temperature cycling resulting from bulk material changes near the glass transition temperature. Scanning acoustic microscope images revealed delamination in one group of <b>gap</b> <b>pad</b> samples and cracking in some putty samples due to temperature cycling. Finite element simulations and laser flash measurements performed to validate the laser flash data indicated that sample holder plate heating, an effect previously unexamined in the literature, can lead to inaccurately high TIM thermal conductivity values due to suppression of the sample temperature rise during the laser flash measurement. This study proposed a semi-empirical methodology to correct for these effects. Simulated laser flash test specimens had bondlines that showed little thickness variation (usually within the measurement error) due to clamping by the sample holder plates. Future work was proposed to refine the laser flash sample holder design and perform additional validation studies using thermal test vehicles based on nonfunctional packages...|$|E

30|$|CICT probes {{the value}} of CI periodically. The {{periodicity}} can be after every operation or periodically after some time gap. We chose a time gap of 5  s. If the observed CI {{is less than the}} desired value of CI, we trigger the time gap padder. The padder inputs the threshold value for the given database design (t 0) from threshold predictor and then pads the input workload with t 0 so that the read follows the update with t 0 delay to ensure the correctness of the read operation. Time <b>gap</b> <b>padding</b> is operationally implemented by delaying the read operation by t 0. Thus the reads are refrained from the unsafe period and outputted as correct reads. This results in improvement in {{the value of}} CI. If the CI is above the desired value, the time gap padder is bypassed and the workload is directed to the replica allocator. Thus the performance is maintained. Thus we get a stable desired value of CI with minimal compromise on performance.|$|R
40|$|There exist {{several sources}} of {{instability}} and mechanisms leading to turbulence which {{are specific to}} hypersonic flows over blunt capsules. One of them are discrete surface inhomogeneities such as attachment-point cavities, compression <b>pads,</b> <b>gaps</b> or steps between heat shield tiles or unevenly ablated thermal protection material, {{which can lead to}} premature laminar-turbulent transition downstream of the protuberance element or even bypass transition if the roughness height/cavity depth is sufficiently large...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{submicron}} <b>gaps</b> between metal <b>pads</b> {{of around}} 100 [*]μm in size {{are difficult to}} fabricate on III-V substrates using electron beam lithography, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist, and metal lift-off. In device fabrication, gold is commonly used to form metal contacts. However, gold etch methods are not well suited to high resolution patterning and lift-off methods are frequently employed. In this paper, the authors investigate {{a number of different}} methods for realizing long 100 [*]nm scale gaps for structures fabricated on III–V substrates. Initially, they explain why the fabrication of long narrow <b>gaps</b> between metal <b>pads</b> using PMMA resist and metal lift-off is difficult. The authors show that 15 [*]nm gaps can be fabricated using a double patterning method and discuss the limitations of this technique. They show that good undercut profiles for metal lift-off can be realized by the controlled etching of a sacrificial polymer layer placed beneath the resist. The authors demonstrate that reliable 100 [*]nm scale gaps can be fabricated between 100 [*]μm square metal pads using these methods...|$|R
50|$|Fixed-length {{packet writing}} (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the {{capacity}} of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours. These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is. Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers. The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block. Although generous <b>gaps</b> (the <b>padding</b> referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.|$|R
40|$|New {{developments}} in Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) detectors to provide fast trigger and high precision muon tracking under sLHC conditions are presented. The modified detectors are shown to stand a high total irradiation dose equivalent to 6 Coulomb/cm of wire, without showing any deterioration in their performance. Two large (1. 2 x 0. 8 m^ 2) prototypes containing four gaps, each <b>gap</b> providing <b>pad,</b> strips and wires readout, {{with a total}} thickness of 50 mm, have been constructed. Their local spatial resolution has been measured in a 100 GeV/c muon test beam at CERN. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap position resolution better than 60 microns has been obtained. For incidence angle of 20 degrees resolution of less than 100 micron was achieved. TGC prototypes were also tested under a flux of 10 ^ 5 Hz/cm^ 2 of 5. 5 - 6. 5 MeV neutrons, showing a high efficiency for cosmic muons detection.

25|$|A blank {{unformatted}} diskette has a {{coating of}} magnetic oxide with no magnetic {{order to the}} particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into sectors, enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; <b>gaps</b> with <b>padding</b> bytes are provided between the sectors {{and at the end}} of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is written into the sector headers {{and at the end of}} the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors. Some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the various}} {{hovertrain}} systems were developing, a major energy use issue cropped up. Hovercraft generate lift by providing pressure, {{as opposed to}} generating lift due to the momentum of air flowing over an airfoil. The pressure of the air required {{is a function of}} the vehicle weight and the size of the lift pad, essentially a measure of overall vehicle density. A non-moving vehicle only loses this air due to leakage around the pads, which can be very low depending on the relative pressure between the pad and the outside atmosphere, and further reduced by introducing a [...] "skirt" [...] to close the <b>gap</b> between the <b>pad</b> and running surface as much as possible.|$|R
40|$|In {{lithium-ion}} battery systems thermal management {{has an important}} influence on performance, safety and service life. Especially in automotive applications short-term peak loads thermally stress the battery cells. Temperature inhomogeneities arise, effecting ageing rates and electrical properties {{with the consequences of}} a reduced system lifetime and diverging state-of-charge of the battery cells. By integration of Phase-Change-Material together with high thermally conductive Pyrolytic Graphite Sheets and graphite <b>gap</b> filler <b>pads,</b> thermal peak shaving and temperature homogenization are implemented to reduce temporal and spatial temperature gradients. In this paper a battery module with prismatic cells and advanced thermal materials was investigated on test-bench. Measurements of temperature rise, differences and distribution at different boundary conditions were performed to evaluate the designed concept. The measured temperature profiles were captured in all three spatial directions within the battery module. As a result, without increasing the volumetric overhead, the maximum rise in temperature was reduced by 13 %, while the additional Phase Change Material has 5 % of the cells mass. Furthermore the temperature difference on module level was kept below 5 K at all conditions above zero degrees ambient temperature even at the maximum specified discharge current and continuous cycling...|$|R
40|$|During the {{re-entry}} into Earth’s atmosphere {{the thermal}} protection system (TPS) of a re-entry capsule has to withstand very high heat loads. Due {{to a lack}} of understanding of the physics of laminar-turbulent transition on such blunt vehicles, the design philosophy so far assumed a fully turbulent flow in flight at all times. This conservative design should be replaced by considering the transition onset location for future returning space vehicles, supported by methods based on stability theory and transient growth considerations. Discrete surface inhomogeneities such as attachment-point cavities, compression <b>pads,</b> <b>gaps</b> or steps between heat shield tiles or unevenly ablated TPS material can lead to premature laminar-turbulent transition downstream of the protuberance element (the type of transition investigated in the present study) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{instantaneous}} luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will {{be increased}} up to {{a factor of}} five {{with respect to the}} present design value by undergoing an extensive upgrade program over the coming decade. The most important upgrade project for the ATLAS Muon System is the replacement of the present first station in the forward regions with the so-called New Small Wheels (NSWs). The NSWs will be installed during the LHC long shutdown in 2019 / 2020. Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) detectors are designed to provide fast trigger and high precision muon tracking under the high luminosity LHC conditions. To validate the design, a full-size prototype sTGC detector of approximately 1. 2 × 1. 0 m 2 consisting of four gaps has been constructed. Each <b>gap</b> provides <b>pad,</b> strip and wire readouts. The sTGC intrinsic spatial resolution has been measured in a 32 GeV pion beam test at Fermilab. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap position resolutions of about 50 μm have been obtained, uniform along the sTGC strip and perpendicular wire directions, well within design requirements. Pad readout measurements have been performed in a 130 GeV muon beam test at CERN. The transition region between readout pads {{has been found to be}} 4 mm, and the pads have been found to be fully efficient...|$|R
50|$|Creating {{the rear}} layer with the {{emitters}} is a multi-step process. First, {{a matrix of}} silver wires is printed on the screen to form the rows or columns, an insulator is added, and then the columns or rows are deposited on top of that. Electrodes are added into this array, typically using platinum, leaving a gap of about 60 micrometres between the columns. Next, square pads of palladium oxide (PdO) only 20 nm thick are deposited into the gaps between the electrodes, connecting to them to supply power. A small slit is cut into the pad in the middle by repeatedly pulsing high currents though them. The resulting erosion causes a gap to form. The <b>gap</b> in the <b>pad</b> forms the emitter. The width of the gap has to be tightly controlled {{in order to work}} properly, and this proved difficult to control in practice.|$|R
30|$|The input {{workload}} to a CICT is {{a series}} of read and update operations. In case of a real time web application, this input is a random sequence of read and update operations separated with random time gap. As we had to control the input workload, the sub transactions on a data object are modelled using a multithreaded, randomly generated sequence of read and updates. Thus the workload was randomized with respect to the number of reads and updates and their occurrence. The database design in terms of number of replicas was statically fed to the tuner and varied for observations. The desired value of CI (CIdesired) was fed and varied for different observation sequence. The threshold–time predictor uses the statistical linear regression between the time gap and number of replicas as discussed in 7.2. 4. The time <b>gap</b> padder then <b>pads</b> the minimum time gap between an update and a succeeding read so that it results in correct read. This results in increase in the value of CI at the cost of response time. When CI reaches the user defined value, the time delay is not introduced until the next poll.|$|R
30|$|Tunable {{consistency}} guarantees in {{big data}} stores help in achieving optimized consistency guarantees with improved performance. Commercial data stores offer tunable consistency guarantees at transaction level where the user specifies the desired level of consistency {{in terms of}} number of participating replicas in read and write consensus. Selective data consistency model applies strict consistency to a subset of data objects. The consistency guarantees of data attributes or objects are measured using an application independent metric called consistency index (CI). Our consistency model is predictive and helps in expression of data consistency {{as a function of}} known database design parameters, like workload characteristics and number of replicas of the data object. This work extends the causal relationships presented in our earlier work and presents adaptive consistency guarantees of this consistency model. The adaptive consistency guarantees are implemented with a consistency tuner, which probes the consistency index of an observed replicated data object in an online application. The tuner uses statistically derived threshold values of an optimum time <b>gap,</b> which, when <b>padded</b> in a workload stream, guarantees a desired value of consistency index for the observed data object. The tuner thus works like a workload scheduler of the replicated data object and pads only the required time delay between the requests {{in such a way that}} desired level of consistency is achieved with minimal effect on performance metrics like response time.|$|R
40|$|Improvised {{explosive}} devices (IEDs) {{have become a}} primary weapon in conflicts against US and allied forces. Improvements in body armor and medicine have increased the survivability of such events. These factors have caused an increase in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by primary blast waves. Injury mechanisms caused from primary blast waves are not clearly understood or defined. How primary blast waves interact with materials or between narrow gaps found between helmet pads is not known. Two novel test fixtures were developed to provide {{a basic understanding of}} these two issues. The first fixture was developed to examine the helmet-head subspace focusing on the so called “underwash” affect. All tests were carried out in the shock tubes at UNL. A relationship between the peak pressures on the forehead and crown of the head and the <b>gap</b> distance between <b>pads</b> was established. Based on these experiments, optimal gap distances were determined to be 1. 6 ”, 2. 1 ” and 2. 9 ” for incident pressures of 30 psi, 20 psi and 10 psi, respectively. The second fixture was developed to investigate the blast mitigation performance of pads and other materials. Collaborative testing was performed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on sandwich samples filled with fluid or fluid-like materials. Results showed that below incident pressures of 20 psi the core material of the sandwich sample has little effect on the blast mitigation performance. Pad materials currently used in the US Army ACH helmet were tested with the blast mitigation performance fixture. Comparison of high speed video footage and pressure profiles taken behind the pads showed that the peak pressure occurs before maximum displacement of the pads into the system. Theoretical stress wave transmission times were compared to experimental values. Results confirm that stress wave propagation is the primary mechanism in blast pressure transmission, compared to dynamic loading caused from local deformation. In addition a novel device, AENID was designed to simulate an IED detonating under the floor of a vehicle such that occupant loading and kinematics can be studied in a repeatable fashion and is offered in the appendix.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 297) A {{series of}} tests were conducted on the shaking table at San Diego State University to determine the shear behavior of non-structural components and their anchor bolts. Three different anchor types were tested, selected because of their varying levels of ductility when forced to failure under shear loading. Anchors were tested in various non-structural component setups and configurations that were observed in building surveys during the initial investigations of the overall project. The dynamic responses of the anchors were compared to the monotonic responses in the different test setups to determine the reduction or increase in capacity, as well as overall anchor response and behavior. Measured anchor results are compared to time-history analysis results and interpretations of this data are presented. The results demonstrate that all anchors have lower dynamic capacities than their monotonic counterparts. Anchors tested with confined and unconfined concrete yielded similar results due to overturning of the non-structural component. Anchor capacity for all anchor types was reduced when cork anti-vibration pads were used. Tests results also show a reduction in anchor capacity when an annular gap is present around anchors. Based on results of the {{series of tests}} performed, generalizations and design recommendations are presented and can be summarized as follows. The reduction in anchor capacity when annular <b>gap</b> or cork <b>pads</b> are present should result in designs that reduce the capacity of these anchors accordingly. The confinement of concrete around the anchors does not increase anchor capacity when any uplift is expected at high force and acceleration levels. Also the ductility difference {{between two of the}} most comparable anchors tested showed that ductility capacity does not increase the dynamic force or displacement capacity of the anchors or earthquake load level at failure. In the tests performed as part of this project the more ductile anchors proved to yield at lower load levels than their brittle counterparts, and both anchor types failed at the same amplification of the selected earthquake record. It is suggested that further investigations be completed to look into the design recommendations given based on the results gathered as part of this thesis. The data provided in this thesis represents an initial step of the testing required to change the design codes that consider non-structural components and anchorage performance under dynamic loading...|$|R
40|$|Technique advancements in {{immersion}} treatment {{have led}} to the emergence of the ImAg surface finish. With its supreme electrical performance, reliable solder joints and competitively low cost, this surface finish has gained considerable attention from PCB manufacturers and suppliers. However, some potential reliability risks with this surface finish also prevent it from gaining wider market adoption. Among these risks, dendrite formation and surface corrosion are the two failure modes with the most serious controversy. A comprehensive analysis of these two failure modes is the main objective of the present study. First of all, the dendrite formation was evaluated using a simple water drop test method. With the presence of liquid water between conductors, the dendrite formation will increase in both speed and severity of several orders of magnitude. The substantial test time reduction makes the water drop test an effective method to check the migration propensity. A comparative study was carried out on the solder pads with ImAg and OSP surface finishes. Experimental conditions included various DC voltage biases, media and <b>gaps</b> between test <b>pads.</b> The time-to-failure (TTF) was defined as the period for the leakage current to reach a certain level. The test results indicate that, when at a higher voltage bias, the TTF of dendrite formation is significantly shorter on the ImAg surface finish than that on the OSP surface finish. Dominant silver in dendrite products reveals its highly susceptible migration propensity. Therefore, a conservative usage of the ImAg surface finish in high-voltage applications is recommended. Then, the tarnish mechanism of the ImAg surface finish was elucidated. A high sulfur-based clay was used to generate a test environment containing sulfide gases. A galvanic corrosion mechanism is proposed to explain the preferred copper corrosion during the clay test. It is more accurate to use the copper content on the ImAg surface as the criterion for both tarnish detection and quantification. In addition, the solder wettability on the tarnished ImAg surface was also assessed through the solder spreading test method. A decrease of solder spreading on the tarnished surface is concluded. This impact turns out to be significant on the test patterns of strip line with smaller widths. Great attention needs to be paid when assembling the fine-pitch surface mount components on a PCB with a tarnished ImAg surface. Finally, the solder joint reliability on the tarnished ImAg surface was studied by means of X-ray, mechanical cross-section, high speed ball pull and fractographic examination. The test conditions included isothermal aging of up to 1000 hours at temperatures of 100 °C, 125 °C and 150 °C respectively. The extra voids in solder joints are concluded to be the only detrimental effect of the tarnished ImAg surface. It is possible to apply the existing industry standard on the solder joint void requirement as the acceptance criterion for solder joints on a tarnished ImAg surface...|$|R
