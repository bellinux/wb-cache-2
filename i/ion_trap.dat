25|$|A linear {{quadrupole}} <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> {{is similar}} to a quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap,</b> but it traps ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap.</b> Thermo Fisher's LTQ ("linear trap quadrupole") {{is an example of the}} linear <b>ion</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>trapping</b> is also {{important}} outside of pharmacology. For example, it causes weakly acidic hormones to accumulate in the cytosol of cells. This is important in keeping the external concentration of the hormone low in the extracellular environment where many hormones are sensed.

25|$|A {{toroidal}} <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> can be visualized as {{a linear}} quadrupole curved around and connected {{at the ends}} or as {{a cross section of}} a 3D <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.|$|E
25|$|The {{cylindrical}} <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> {{mass spectrometer}} (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as {{the size of}} a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field {{near the center of the}} trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.|$|E

25|$|Quadrupole mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap,</b> particularly the linear quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.|$|E

25|$|Spectral skewing is {{the change}} in {{relative}} intensity of mass spectral peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral skewing is not observed in <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.|$|E
25|$|The {{quadrupole}} <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> {{works on}} the same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, {{in which case the}} ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.|$|E

40|$|In these lecture notes, I {{describe}} {{the use of}} <b>ion</b> <b>traps</b> in experimental investigations of spectroscopy and quantum optics. <b>Ion</b> <b>traps</b> are well suited {{to this type of}} investigation because of the well-controlled conditions under which ions are held in traps and because they are well isolated from the environment. The notes start with an account of the way that <b>ion</b> <b>traps</b> work, concentrating on the radiofrequency or Paul trap. The techniques of laser cooling in <b>ion</b> <b>traps</b> are then discussed. Laser cooling is important because it allows new experiments to be performed which otherwise would not be possible. In particular, it allows one to work with single atomic particles and in some circumstances to cool them even to the ground state of the vibrational motion. The rest of the notes deal with various experimental studies undertaken in spectroscopy and quantum optics with <b>trapped</b> <b>ions,</b> including observations of quantum jumps; cavity quantum electrodynamics; nonclassical states; quantum logic gates; the quantum Zeno effect; and frequency standards and fundamental constants. These notes do not attempt to give a full account of the theory of these phenomena, but rather to give an idea of the special characteristics of <b>ion</b> <b>traps,</b> of the very wide range of investigations that have been undertaken with them, and of the potential they hold for future investigations in spectroscopy, quantum optics and other areas of physics. 1...|$|R
25|$|A tandem mass {{spectrometer}} is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by {{some form of}} molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a {{mass spectrometer}}. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also {{be done in a}} single mass analyzer over time, as in a quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap.</b> There are various methods for fragmenting molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced dissociation (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in protein identification.|$|E
25|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} (AP) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique (ion source) that {{in contrast}} to vacuum MALDI operates at normal atmospheric environment. The main difference between vacuum MALDI and AP-MALDI is the pressure in which the ions are created. In vacuum MALDI, ions are typically produced at 10 mTorr or less while in AP-MALDI ions are formed in atmospheric pressure. In the past the main disadvantage of AP MALDI technique compared to the conventional vacuum MALDI has been its limited sensitivity; however, ions can be transferred into the mass spectrometer with high efficiency and attomole detection limits have been reported. AP-MALDI is used in mass spectrometry (MS) {{in a variety of}} applications ranging from proteomics to drug discovery. Popular topics that are addressed by AP-MALDI mass spectrometry include: proteomics; mass analysis of DNA, RNA, PNA, lipids, oligosaccharides, phosphopeptides, bacteria, small molecules and synthetic polymers, similar applications as available also for vacuum MALDI instruments. The AP-MALDI ion source is easily coupled to an <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> mass spectrometer or any other MS system equipped with ESI (electrospray ionization) or nanoESI source.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>trapping</b> is {{the reason}} why basic (alkaline) drugs are {{secreted}} into the stomach (for example morphine), where pH is acidic, and acidic drugs are excreted in urine when it is alkaline.

[...] These complex and large GC-MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) gas chromatographs that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems. [...] Additionally, the systems are smaller, and more mobile, including units that are mounted in mobile analytical laboratories (MAL), such as those used by the United States Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force MAL and other similar laboratories, and systems that are hand-carried by two-person teams or individuals, much ado to the smaller mass detectors.

2500|$|By far {{the most}} common and perhaps {{standard}} form of ionization is electron ionization (EI). [...] The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> itself in an <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb. [...] The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way. [...] This [...] "hard ionization" [...] technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and few, if any, molecules approaching the molecular mass unit. [...] Hard ionization is considered by mass spectrometrists as the employ of molecular electron bombardment, whereas [...] "soft ionization" [...] is charge by molecular collision with an introduced gas. [...] The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependent upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electron Volts). [...] The use of 70 eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with library spectra using manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA). Spectral library searches employ [...] matching algorithms such as Probability Based Matching and dot-product matching that are used with methods of analysis written by many method standardization agencies.
