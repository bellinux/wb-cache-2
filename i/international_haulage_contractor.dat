40|$|Abstract: Horizontal {{cooperation}} between road <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> {{is well established}} in practice. However, over time many cooperations were subject to transformational processes that led their organizations to merge. Here, a concept of collaborative planning, operational transport collaboration, is discussed. This concept achieves higher degrees of organizational autonomy for the participants of cooperation. The idea behind operational transport collaboration is an exchange of transportation requests {{in order to create}} competitive advantages in terms of cost and flexibility. For this exchange, mechanisms have to be found that create the best possible allocation of transportation requests to road <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors.</b> Criteria which mechanisms have to comply with in order to create beneficial and desirable solutions for all participants despite the situation of asymmetric information and strategic behavior are derived from microeconomics and game theory. Combinatorial auctions are then discussed as one means of fulfilling these criteria...|$|R

50|$|Some heavy {{goods vehicle}} {{operators}} (typically big-name retailers, rather than <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors)</b> further reduce their HGV limiters from 90 km/h to a lower speed, typically 85 or 80 km/h (53 or 50 mph), in a claimed bid {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This is again often highlighted by a warning sticker on the truck's tailgate.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 tenders {{were invited}} for the {{collection}} of garden refuse and bulky refuse in containers. This was due to (for instance) dissatisfaction from other <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> because the task without supplies {{was carried out by}} Renoflex, and they thought this was unfair. This led to a splitting up of the contract into two districts (north and south) that [...] are served by two separate companies.|$|R

Initially, it manufactured chassis for heavy motor vehicles, including London buses, later also producing engines, with the vehicles branded as Hallfords (after its telegraphic address, a conflation of 'Hall' and 'Dartford'). Brewers and <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> equipped their fleets with Hallfords, and the British Army deployed Hallford lorries during World War I. They {{continued to be}} sold until 1926.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} whether operators, in the municipality of Örnsköldsvik, comply to current regulations and guidelines regarding oil separator. In addition to this, the report also identify which standards the regulatory authority can demand of identified deficiencies, {{as well as an}} examination in how the status of oil separator are in other municipalities in Sweden. First a delimitation was made to only investigate environmentally hazardous activities such as <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors.</b> Inventories were made of a total of 12 <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors,</b> with questions from a previously made checklist. The results of the inventory indicated deficiencies in operators existing knowledge, regular self-inspection of oil separators, control frequency, record-keeping and documentation, lack of 5 -year inspection and lack of oil- and sludge level alarm. This report also shows that regulatory authority can require the operators to rectify these deficiencies, in accordance with standards and established guidelines. The report also showed similar results when compared with similar surveys of operators' self-inspection of oil separator, in other municipalities in Sweden. The study suggests that regulatory authority should priority to oversight these environmentally hazardous activities with oil separators...|$|R
50|$|One of Karkare's associates, Ghanashyam Gilda, {{borrowed}} a few lorries from <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> {{to bring the}} refugees into town and even managed to find some tin shelters for them. Karkare took the responsibility to give refugees free meals in his hotel. After a few days, Karkare managed to borrow some tents from the army and had them set up. For nearly a month, till the Visapur refugee camp was established, Karkare must have given between 30,000 and 35,000 free meals.|$|R
40|$|The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) {{now offers}} a {{complete}} door-to-door parcel service, {{combined with other}} logistical services ("ExpressCargo"). In doing so, they have intensified competition with private <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors.</b> By contrast, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and the German Railway (DB) abandoned this line of business {{at the end of}} 1996 and the end of 1997, respectively, owing to insufficient earnings. DB and SBB now concentrate their activities on the core sectors of rail transport and have withdrawn from services which are also offered on competitive markets. The ÖBB, on the other hand, pursue a strategy of extending their operations with the goal of raising the utilization of existing capacities. With regard to the parcel service, the government payments to the ÖBB might distort competition between the ÖBB's "ExpressCargo" and the general rail shipment provided by private <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors.</b> In 1997, the federal government paid ATS 16. 4 billion to the ÖBB to reimburse the ÖBB for the costs of operating the railtrack and of expanding the railroad infrastructure {{as well as for the}} costs of providing public services. These payments are covered by the general social consensus in Austria and are intended to help the "environmentally friendly" railways compete with road transportation. The environment argument is, however, irrelevant for competition between "ExpressCargo" and general rail shipment provided by <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> because these services do not differ in their impact on the environment. Market distortions my also result from the enterprise structure of the ÖBB. The ÖBB are a vertically integrated firm, with activities ranging from the operation of the infrastructure to rail transport, to logistic services. The ÖBB, moreover, have the monopoly of "environmentally friendly" rail transport. A vertically integrated firm is likely to support strategically important lines of activity if this support is necessary for strengthening its overall market position or maximizing profits. Such cross subsidies are, however, problematic for the entire economy, if such subsidies are drawn from monopoly rents and from business activities subsidized by the government. In this particular case, the possibility should be ruled out that the competitive position of "ExpressCargo" vis-à-vis the competing <b>haulage</b> <b>contractors</b> is strengthened by cross subsidies and that the ÖBB render access to rail services more difficult to competing rail parcel services. Monitoring of the infrastructure balance sheets and of the use of funds for public services by public accountants and the Ministry for Science and Transportation may reveal undesirable cross subsidies and market distortions ex post. The establishment of independent enterprises for the business segments of rail infrastructure, transportation, and logistic would, however, rule out market distortions ex ante.

This article presents a case study where an interval based decision tool was used for transportation business applications. The investigation was made in collaboration with a well-established shipping com-pany as well as a well-established <b>haulage</b> <b>contractor.</b> The tool used in this study utilizes a generalization of the prin-ciple of maximizing the expected utility, and is particularly suitable when a decision maker does not possess precise in-formation of future scenarios and expected outcomes...|$|R

50|$|Aldershot & District {{was inaugurated}} on 24 July 1912 when the British Automobile Traction Company Limited (a {{subsidiary}} of British Electric Traction Company - BET) bought the pioneering Aldershot & Farnborough Motor Omnibus Company Ltd, whose 5 buses had operated services {{between those two}} towns since 1906. The initial livery was dark green and white, with the upper deck of double-deckers being a lighter green. Variations on a theme of two-tone green continued, later with cream relief replacing the white. The familiar looped fleetname was introduced in 1923 and lasted until 1968.

40|$|Different {{organizations}} {{are committed to}} reducing deaths and serious injuries in road traffic. Their activities must be guided by research to produce measurable results contributed in reducing casualties and making roads safer. This paper provides detailed information about {{the second stage of}} the study for an evaluation of social legislation infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers involved in severe road transport accidents. The data were obtained from original sources of information: from digital tachograph printouts, analog tachograph data record sheets and attestations of activities. The aim of the second research stage was to find out to which extent the drivers involved in severe road traffic accidents (hereinafter RTA) have committed infringements more often and in larger quantities compared to the data obtained from the vehicle and driver regular roadside checks, i. e. compared with the drivers not involved in RTA. The second task for the paper is to analyze infringements by type and by level of drivers' riskiness {{to be involved in the}} RTA. The obtained findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies have been compiled, processed, analyzed and systematized by severity, quantity and type of simultaneously committed offences, installed tachograph type and other parameters. The statistical data have been grouped, systematized and analyzed according to the aim of the research. Based on various sources of information, an analysis of infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers was made between the obtained average amount of infringements per severe RTA case and per regular roadside check. The results of the research state that the drivers involved in severe RTA have committed considerably more infringements before the actual RTA has happened. The most part of infringements directly or indirectly refers to the lack of rest time and increased driving or overall working hours. These infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers are referred to be as major factors contributing to drivers' fatigue and high accidents risk...|$|R
50|$|The chief {{figure of}} the Board of Governors was Thomas Cure, the senior Warden of St Saviour's, a special {{corporation}} chartered by King Henry VIII to look after both the great priory church and various local charitable bequests. Cure was the Royal Saddler, effectively a <b>haulage</b> <b>contractor,</b> for Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I and lived near the north-west corner of St Saviour's Church. He was a major local benefactor and his endowments are still administered by the corporation; he is commemorated in the Cathedral. The High Master (headmaster) was paid £20 per year and initially only boys from St Saviour's parish could be admitted for a fee of half a crown (2s. 6d), while those from St Olave's and other parishes could pay a fee to the High Master to arrange a schoolmaster for their instruction. St Olave's parish established its own Grammar School in 1571, which meant there were two such foundations within 200 yards of each other.|$|R
