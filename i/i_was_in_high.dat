40|$|Relative {{importance}} of harvest index (I) and total biomass yield (B) to economic yield (Y) <b>was</b> assessed <b>in</b> several food crops {{at different levels}} of environmental productivity. Importance of B <b>is</b> generally <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> low than <b>high</b> yielding environments, while that of <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> than low yielding environments.

Past efforts by anonymous farmers have consummated a good part of genetic improvement of crop yields through improvement in B. Many venerable land cultivars of grain crops, adapted to unimproved, limited-input cultural conditions, evolved through this process. The same process may not have thoroughly exhausted the yield improvement opportunity through improving I. Success in yield improvement by modern breeding has been limited mainly to high-input cultural conditions characterized by higher soil fertility and irrigation mainly through improvement in I.
