500|$|In 1832, the German {{mathematician}} Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{assisted by}} Wilhelm Weber, <b>implicitly</b> <b>defined</b> the second {{as a base}} unit when he quoted the earth's magnetic field in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds. [...] Prior to this, {{the strength of the}} earth's magnetic field had only been described in relative terms. The technique used by Gauss was to equate the torque induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the earth's magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the magnetic field.|$|E
500|$|When the Peano axioms {{were first}} proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms <b>implicitly</b> <b>defined</b> {{what we mean}} by a [...] "natural number". of which the series of the natural numbers is one instance. Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were consistent; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their {{consistency}} using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.|$|E
