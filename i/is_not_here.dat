Pang was then asked to be Lennon and Ono's {{secretary}} and factotum/gofer in New York and England, {{which led to a}} permanent position as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to New York in 1971. Pang coordinated an art exhibition in Syracuse, New York, on October 9, 1971, for Ono's This <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Here</b> art show at the Everson Museum. Ono's show coincided with Lennon's 31st birthday, and a party was held at the Hotel Syracuse, which was attended by Ringo Starr, Phil Spector, and Elliot Mintz, among others.|$|E

On November 15, 1998, Hasbro Interactive released a PC version of its own, where Vanna White is joined by the then-current Wheel announcer, Charlie O'Donnell (but Pat Sajak <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>here).</b> In 2000 Infogrames Entertainment produced a PC version of the show for Macintosh computers, with MacSoft as its developer. That same year, Hasbro released a second PC version of Wheel, which like the aforementioned PlayStation equivalent features a behind-the-scenes interview and a qualifying exam. Atari's 2003 follow-up also saw a PC version of its own.|$|E

500|$|Ono would enact {{many of the}} book's {{scenarios}} as performance pieces {{throughout her}} career, which {{formed the basis for}} her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized retrospective exhibition, This <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Here</b> in 1971 at the Everson Museum in Syracuse, New York, that was nearly closed when it was besieged by excited Beatles fans, who broke several of the art pieces and flooded the toilets.

500|$|The French {{withdrawal}} was not announced and {{was supposed}} to be secret, but the local church leadership found out quickly and the local Catholic community had already begun to move to the ports before end of talks in Geneva. By the time the accords were signed, 45,000 Catholic refugees were already waiting in Hanoi, Haiphong or Hải Dương. According to the records of the Catholic Church, over 70% of Catholics in Bui Chu and Phat Diem left, compared to around 50% in most other areas. The Catholic records claim that only a third of Hanoi Catholics left, and that around 80% of all clergy left. In all areas, a higher proportion of priests left than laypeople, which has been attributed to the communists inflicting heavier punishments on more prominent opposition figures, such as clerics. The departure rate was also lower in areas further removed from the coastal areas and departure ports; in Hưng Hóa, only 11.8% of Catholics were recorded by their diocese as have migrated. It has been speculated that the low rate of Hanoi residents choosing to depart may have been because the city was relatively untouched by the decade of fighting, and that the varying and high rate of departures among rural Catholics was due to the influence of the local clergy; priests in northern Vietnam were noted to be more theocratic and involved in civic decision-making. They used a variety of ways to persuade their disciples to migrate; some explained their belief that circumstances would be difficult for people who did not immigrate, some simply gave dogmatic reasons such as [...] "God <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>here</b> any more", while others gave no reason at all and made declarations such as [...] "We are leaving tomorrow" [...] in the expectation that their followers would obey without question. Surveys on the immigrants suggested they were largely content to follow the recommendation of the local priest. In some areas, the bishop in charge of the diocese told Catholics to stay, but laypeople were more likely to leave or stay depending on the stance of the local priest with whom they had regular contact; in many cases, such as in Hanoi, a majority of priests ignored their bishop and left anyway.|$|E
