However, shrimp can also be caught by the use of cast net, which is locally termed 'thukri'. The catching is mainly carried out in shallow depths from October to March.

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of {{regions in the}} analysis of innovation and the pressure on European universities to interact with their environment justify this article. It argues that faculty support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> university-industry relations (UIR) does not vary across disciplines and does not respond to university encouragement in a region with low absorptive capacity. These results are in contrast with those obtained in studies of technology leading countries like the USA. Furthermore, incentives for UIR may generate unpredicted dynamics while instruments to cooperate are not significant. Finally, support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> UIR {{should not be confused with}} the degree of R&D cooperation. The former is sensitive to university age while the latter is sensitive to gender, discipline, commitment to R&D and university encouragement.

After Santo Antão was inhabited, families ranched on the island around the late 16th or the early 17th century. Drought and dry conditions could not create a permanent settlement on the island. In 1524, a Dutch fleet which had 3,300 sailors, commanded by admiral Jacob Willekens passed through Porto Grande Bay before he captured Bahia in Brazil. The island's first fortification was built in 1734 to protect against British, French and Dutch pirates which was dominant at the time, the island was raided in 1781, it led to a new settlement to be made within the fort. The island was the last uninhabited main island in Cape Verde until 1795, the first settlement of Nossa Senhora da Luz was founded in the east of Porto Grande Bay, its first settlers were mainly slaves {{that came from the}} island, the island's population was 120 in 1819, the colonial governor António Pusic brought some families from Santo Antão to inhabit the village, also the village was to receive a new name, the first was Leopoldinha after the empress Maria Leopoldina of Austria, wife of Peter IV of Portugal. After Brazil became independent on September 22, 1822, Portugal lost a colony, in 1835, Englishman John Lewis visited the island <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> finding the port's conditions for serving as a scale for English ships for the British India Company. The village became a coal deposit to supply ships on Atlantic routes, it was created by the British to link with other parts of the Empire. After the Portuguese Liberation War was ended, Marquis of Sá da Bandeira adopted the settlement name Mindelo under a decree in 1838 after the military expedition in the beaches of Mindelo, Portugal. In the same year, the colonial capital was to be moved from Praia on Santiago due to a growing population, many people on Santiago did not want the move. the capital stayed in Praia.
