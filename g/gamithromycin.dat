40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine (i) whether an association exists between individual pharmacokinetic parameters and treatment outcome when feeder cattle were diagnosed with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and treated with <b>gamithromycin</b> (Zactran) at the label dose and (ii) whether there was a stronger association between treatment outcome and <b>gamithromycin</b> concentration in plasma or in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) effect compartment. The study design was a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial utilizing three groups of 60 (362 – 592 lb) steers/bulls randomly allocated within origin to sham injection or <b>gamithromycin</b> mass medication. Cattle were evaluated daily for signs of BRD by a veterinarian blinded to treatment. Animals meeting the BRD case definition were enrolled and allocated to a sample collection scheme consisting of samples for bacterial isolation (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs) and <b>gamithromycin</b> concentration determination (PELF and plasma). <b>Gamithromycin</b> susceptibility of M. haemolytica (n = 287) and P. multocida (n = 257) were determined using broth microdilution with frozen panels containing <b>gamithromycin</b> at concentrations from 0. 03 to 16 ug/mL. A two-compartment plasma pharmacokinetic model with an additional compartment for <b>gamithromycin</b> in PELF was developed using rich data sets from published and unpublished studies. The sparse data from our study were then fit to this model using nonlinear mixed effects modeling to estimate individual parameter values. The resulting parameter estimates were used to simulate full time–concentration profiles for each animal in this study. These profiles were analyzed using noncompartmental methods so that PK/PD indices (AUC 24 /MIC, AUC∞/MIC, CMAX/MIC) could be calculated for plasma and PELF (also T 3 ̆eMIC) for each individual. The calculated PK/PD indices were indicative that for both M. haemolytica and P. multocida a higher drug exposure in terms of concentration, and duration of exposure relative to the MIC of the target pathogen, was favorable to a successful case outcome. A significant association was found between treatment success and PELF AUC 0 – 24 /MIC for P. multocida. The calves in this study demonstrated an increased clearance and volume of distribution in plasma as compared to the healthy calves in two previously published reports. Ultimately, the findings from this study indicate that higher PK/PD indices were predictive of positive treatment outcomes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was, under {{experimental}} conditions, to investigate infection of Norwegian White sheep with ovine and bovine isolates of Dichelobacter nodosus of varying virulence. In addition, the efficacy of <b>gamithromycin</b> as a treatment for the experimentally induced infections was examined. The study was performed as a single foot inoculation using a boot. Four groups, each with six lambs, were inoculated with four different challenge strains (Group 1 : benign bovine strain; Group 2 : virulent bovine strain; Group 3 : benign ovine strain; Group 4 : virulent ovine strain). The main criterion to determine that infection was transferred was that D. nodosus isolate was obtained by culture. After the trial all lambs were treated with <b>gamithromycin.</b> Clinical symptoms of footrot developed in all groups, and when removing the boots two weeks after challenge, D. nodosus was isolated from 5 of 24 experimental lambs. All lambs tested negative for D. nodosus by PCR within six weeks after treatment with <b>gamithromycin.</b> This study strongly indicates that D. nodosus isolates from both sheep and cattle can be transferred to sheep under experimental conditions.

Forty calves were randomly allocated on day − 11, restricted by body weight, {{to one of three}} treatment groups given <b>gamithromycin</b> at 6 mg/kg of body weight 10, 5, or 1 days before challenge or to an untreated control group. M. haemolytica A 1 challenge infections were induced on day 0 by depositing 7. 4 × 107 CFU at the bifurcation of the main bronchus using a bronchoscope. Clinical observations were made daily from the day of allocation to day 10, when necropsy was scheduled; three calves died or were euthanized in extremis on welfare grounds prior to scheduled necropsy. At necropsy the lungs were removed, pneumonic lesions were scored, and samples of lung tissue were cultured for M. haemolytica. The three groups of animals treated with <b>gamithromycin</b> before challenge had significantly lower lung M. haemolytica counts and fewer clinical signs of respiratory disease than did the saline-treated group. For most of the clinical parameters, the pattern of responses differed significantly (P < 0. 05) between the gamithromycin-treated groups and the control group.

40|$|Introduction : Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is {{a potent}} inducer of the bovine acute phase {{response}} and has been widely used in research to provoke acute inflammation. An intravenous challenge with LPS elicits the endogenous synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). These cytokines initiate fever and stimulate the hepatic production of acute phase proteins, such as Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Regarding the fact that immunomodulating drugs are able to influence this acute phase response, {{the aim of the}} present research was to study the potentials of dexamethasone and <b>gamithromycin</b> in a standardized LPS-inflammation model. Dexamethasone was applied as a positive control, due to its major anti-inflammatory effects. The novel azalide <b>gamithromycin</b> on the other hand, was selected since macrolide antibiotics have been reported to exert immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, the combination of both drugs was studied for possible additive and/or synergistic effects. Materials and Methods : A standardized and reproducible inflammation model was developed by challenging twelve 4 -week-old calves intravenously with a single dose of LPS (E. coli serotype O 111 :B 4, 0. 5 µg/kg body weight (BW)). Three control animals on the other hand received an equivalent volume of 0. 9 % NaCl. Rectal body temperature was measured and plasma samples were collected at several points in time until 72 h p. a. These samples were analyzed using ELISAs for TNF-α, IL- 6 and SAA. As part of the immunomodulation study, eighteen different calves were randomly divided in three groups, each group consisting of six calves. The groups received a single bolus of respectively 0. 3 mg/kg BW dexamethasone i. m. (Dexa 0. 2 %®, Kela), 6 mg/kg BW <b>gamithromycin</b> s. c. (Zactran®, Merial) and the combination of both drugs. At Tmax of the drug (time at which the maximum plasma concentration is reached) the LPS-bolus was administered, followed by a similar experimental design as for the inflammation model. Results and Conclusions : In comparison with the results obtained in LPS-administered animals which did not receive any treatment, dexamethasone and the combination of dexamethasone and <b>gamithromycin</b> significantly inhibited the release of TNF-α, IL- 6 and SAA after an LPS-challenge. The administration of <b>gamithromycin</b> solely did not affect the cytokine and acute phase protein concentrations. Regarding the course of the body temperature, neither dexamethasone, nor the combination had a major influence, while <b>gamithromycin</b> alone induced a remarkable delay of the maximum body temperature. In other words, these results demonstrate the possible additive effect of a combined administration of an antibiotic with a corticosteroid in the acute phase of a bacterial infection, which could contribute to a better clinical condition of the animal...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : <b>Gamithromycin,</b> a 15 -membered semi-synthetic {{macrolide}} antibiotic of the azalide subclass, {{has recently}} been developed for the treatment and prevention of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Besides the anti-infectious properties, macrolides have frequently {{been reported to be}} able to influence various inflammatory processes, such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of <b>gamithromycin</b> in pigs, whereafter the disposition of the antibiotic can be used in further research to investigate its immunomodulating properties in a porcine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inflammation model. Materials and Methods : Twelve male pigs, with a mean body weight (BW) of 24. 4 kg were randomly divided in two groups. The animals received a single injection of 6 mg/kg BW <b>gamithromycin</b> (ZACTRAN®, Merial), either intravenously (IV) in the ear vein (n = 6) or subcutaneously (SC) (n = 6). Blood was collected from the jugular vein into EDTA tubes before administration; on day 0 at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h post administration (p. a.) and once daily from day 2 to day 14 p. a. (24 h intervals). Plasma was isolated and stored at ≤ - 15 °C until analysis. Quantitation of <b>gamithromycin</b> in the plasma samples was performed using an in-house developed and validated LC-MS/MS method. The pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using the software program WinNonlin (Pharsight). Results and Conclusions : The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0 →∞), absolute bioavailability (F), half-life of absorption and elimination (t 1 / 2 abs and t 1 / 2 el, respectively), volume of distribution (Vd), clearance (Cl), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) were determined and critically compared to the PK parameters in cattle and foals 1, 2.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Science and IndustryChris ReinhardtDan ThomsonBovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) is {{the most}} common and costly disease in feedlot cattle in North America. Annual {{economic}} losses are estimated to be US$ 1 billion due to mortality, reduced performance, and treatment costs. The disease is a multifactorial syndrome caused by a combination of environmental factors, management practices, animal susceptibility, and viral and bacterial pathogens. The objectives of this dissertation were to evaluate two injectable antimicrobials for the treatment and control of BRDC in feedlot cattle, investigation of factors associated with BRDC mortality and morbidity, and to develop control charts based on statistical process control (SPC) principles to monitor cattle mortality rates. Two multi-site prospective studies were conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the administration of <b>gamithromycin</b> and tulathromycin for the treatment and control of BRDC. A total of 2, 529 animals were enrolled at two commercial feedlot locations to evaluate the efficacy of the antimicrobials to control BRDC. Morbidity due to BRDC was higher (P = 0. 03) among calves receiving <b>gamithromycin</b> compared with those receiving tulathromycin; however, treatments were considered bioequivalent (P < 0. 05) for BRDC mortality, case fatality rate and re-treatment rate. Final BW, ADG, DMI and F:G, were similar (P< 0. 05) between the groups of calves receiving <b>gamithromycin</b> and tulathromycin. For the evaluation of treatment efficacy, a total of 1, 049 calves were enrolled in the study. Re-treatment rate was higher among animals treated with <b>gamithromycin</b> compared with those treated with tulathromycin. Treatments were bioequivalent (P < 0. 05) for case fatality rate, final BW, and ADG. To evaluate factors associated with BRDC, a retrospective study was conducted to analyze BRDC mortality and morbidity associated with initial body weight, rectal temperature, and castration and dehorning (tipping) at processing. Calves with lighter weights and fever at processing were at greater risk of mortality and morbidity due to BRDC. Also, bulls castrated at processing were at higher risk of developing BRDC. Finally, we developed control charts based on SPC principles to monitor and identify “normal” and special cases of variation of mortality rate.

BRD is a multifaceted group of pathogens, both viral and bacterial, that take advantage of an immune compromised calf to cause disease. This study took aim at comparing metaphylactic treatments for BRD in both the feedlot and pasture setting. In the feedlot study, heifers (n= 579, 403. 7 ± 27. 4 lbs) from Southwest Texas were identified as being high risk for BRD and shipped to the Clayton Livestock Research Center in Clayton, NM. Cattle were randomly allocated within truck load lots into 18 to 20 head treatment pens (30 pens; 3 treatments; 10 reps). Cattle were given one of three metaphylactic treatments based on the randomly assigned treatment for their pen within a replicate. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) <b>Gamithromycin</b> (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were fed a typical commercial starter diet for the first 56 - 60 d with a step-up ration change at day 28. At the end of the feeding period, pens were weighed and body weights recorded. Dry Matter Intake, morbidity, and mortality were recorded by CLRC personnel daily. Cattle administered tulathromycin had higher daily gains than cattle administered <b>gamithromycin</b> by 0. 29 lbs/d (P<. 01) and tended (P= 0. 09) have higher daily gains than cattle that received tilmicosin by 0. 18 lbs/d. Tulathromycin treated cattle tended (P = 0. 12) to have improved feed efficiency compared to <b>gamithromycin</b> treated cattle. Cattle that received tulathromycin (5. 2 %) had lower morbidity rates (P <. 02) than tilmicosin (14. 6 %) and <b>gamithromycin</b> (12. 79 %) treated cattle. There were no treatment differences in dry matter intake or mortality in cattle. For the wheat pasture study, heifers (n= 120, 393. 2 ± 28. 6 lbs) from the same origin and risk were shipped to the CLRC and processed before being trailed to a nearby wheat pasture. Cattle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (3 treatments, 40 reps), and were given one of three metaphylactic treatments. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) <b>Gamithromycin</b> (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were allowed to graze on wheat for 54 days with free-choice Hi-Pro mineral mixed with Lasalocid, an ionophore. After 54 days on wheat pasture, the cattle were trailed back to the CLRC facilities and final individual weights were recorded. Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily by CLRC personnel.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDiagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyMichael D. ApleyBovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) remains a major disease in beef production systems. The administration of antimicrobials {{for both the}} control and treatment of acute BRD is common. According to most published accounts, antimicrobial resistance among BRD pathogens is increasing; therefore, judicious antimicrobial usage is vital for continued efficacy. The introduction of a novel antimicrobial class has not occurred {{for well over a}} decade, therefore it is paramount to maximize efficacy of the antimicrobials currently available. The challenge is targeting the perfect scenario: maximizing clinical efficacy while minimizing antimicrobial resistance. The host-pathogen-drug interaction is very complex and despite current sophisticated technology, this interaction is still not well understood for many infectious diseases. This dissertation work sought to investigate the effects of the administration of a macrolide for both control and treatment of acute BRD on the prevalence of resistance among isolated Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Whole genome sequencing of M. haemolytica was utilized to investigate the presence/absence of macrolide resistance genes and their relationship to the observed minimum inhibitory concentration. Cattle were sampled (plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid) after administration of <b>gamithromycin</b> for drug concentration analysis. A non-linear mixed effects approach was used to fit a compartmental model to the resulting sparse pharmacokinetic data so that a complete time concentration curve could be simulated. From these curves, the CMAX and AUC were measured and used to calculate standard PKPD indices using the MIC values of the isolated bacteria. Clear associations between the use of <b>gamithromycin</b> for control and treatment of BRD and a statistically significantly increased likelihood of macrolide resistance were not found, possibly due to sample size limitations. The calculation of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic indices found that a longer drug exposure was more closely associated with a successful treatment outcome, but there was not a statistically significant correlation. However, there were few clinical failures in this study giving further credence to the complexity of the in vivo system. There are many factors beyond pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and MICs that contribute to the success of a treatment regimen for cattle suffering from BRD...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} how resistance to macrolides is conferred in field isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica that lack previously identified resistance determinants for rRNAmethylation, efflux and macrolide-modifying enzymes. Methods: Isolates of P. multocida andM. haemolytica {{identified as being}} highly resistant (MICs. 64 mg/L) to the macrolides erythromycin, <b>gamithromycin,</b> tilmicosin, tildipirosin and tulathromycin were screened by multiplex PCR for the previously identified resistance genes erm(42),msr(E) andmph(E). Strains lacking these determinants were analysed by genome sequencing and primer extension on the rRNAs. Results: Macrolide resistance in one M. haemolytica isolate was conferred by the 23 S rRNA mutation A 2058 G; resistance in three P. multocida isolates were caused by mutations at the neighbouring nucleotide A 2059 G. In each strain, all six copies of the rrn operons encoded the respective mutations. There were no mutations in the ribosomal protein genes rplD or rplV, and no other macrolide resistance mechanism was evident. Conclusions: High-level macrolide resistance can arise from 23 S rRNA mutations in P. multocida and M. haemo-lytica despite their multiple copies of rrn. Selective pressures from exposure to different macrolide or lincosamide drugs presumably resulted in consolidation of either the A 2058 G or the A 2059 G mutation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTAntimicrobial {{metaphylaxis}} is {{an important}} tool used {{for the prevention of}} bovine respiratory disease complex, an economically important disease that typically affects newly weaned beef calves that are marketed and transported a distance from their origin. An experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} administering 2 different metaphylactic products [tulathromycin (TULA) and <b>gamithromycin</b> (GAMI) ] on differences on core body temperature, health, and performance on 284 highly stressed stocker calves. Calves were procured and delivered (transient time = 13. 5 h average) from a southeastern United States order buyer in 3 truckload lots during a 6 -d period in October 2011. The core body temperatures in nonmorbid calves in the TULA calves were greater compared with the GAMI calves the first 2 h after administration and at multiple time points on d 4 through 6 of the experiment (P < 0. 05). Calves receiving TULA experienced less morbidity (P < 0. 01) and less chronicity (P < 0. 05) when compared with GAMI calves. Calves in the TULA group had greater ADG (P < 0. 001) from arrival to d 45 compared with calves injected with GAMI. This experiment indicated that metaphylactic products may affect core body temperature differently, which may be an important consideration when managing the health of high-risk calves. Moreover, both health and performance differences may exist among calves administered different metaphylactic products.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify resistances that were acquired over the last 30 years in France and to determine their prevalence within comtemporary strains. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 12 antimicrobials, considered active on M. bovis, were compared, using an agar dilution method, between 27 and 46 M. bovis isolates respectively obtained in 1978 – 1979 and in 2010 – 2012 from 73 distinct respiratory disease outbreaks in young cattle all over France. For eight antimicrobials, resistances were proven to be acquired over the period and expressed by all contemporary strains. The increase of the MIC value that inhibited 50 % of the isolates (MIC 50) was: i) substantial for tylosin, tilmicosin, tulathromycin and spectinomycin, from 2 to. 64, 2 to. 128, 16 to 128 and 4 to. 64 mg/mL, respectively, ii) moderate for enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, marbofloxacin and oxytetracycline, from 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 5 to 1, 32 to. 32 mg/mL, respectively.

Journal of Animal Science, 95 (2), 626 - 635. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016. 1062 The objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of antimicrobials approved for parenteral metaphylactic use in feeder and stocker calves on morbidity and mortality for bovine respiratory disease {{with the use of}} a {{mixed treatment}} comparison meta-analysis. An initial literature review was conducted in April 2016 through Pubmed, Agricola, and CAB (Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau) for randomized controlled trials for metaphylaxis antimicrobial administered parentally to incoming feedlot or stocker calves within 48 h of arrival. The final list of publications included 29 studies, with a total of 37 trials. There were 8 different metaphylactic antimicrobials. Final event outcomes were categorized into bovine respiratory disease (BRD) morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to <= 60 of the feeding period, BRD morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, and BRD retreatment cumulative incidence morbidity d 1 to closeout of the feeding period. Network meta-analysis combined direct and indirect evidence for all the event outcomes to determine mean odds ratio (OR) with 95 % credibility intervals (CrIs) for all metaphylactic antimicrobial comparisons. The "upper tier" treatment arms for morbidity d 1 to <= 60 included tulathromycin, <b>gamithromycin,</b> and tilmicosin. For BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout and BRD retreatment morbidity d 1 to closeout, classifying the treatment arms into tiers was not possible due to overlapping 95 % CrIs. The results of this project accurately identified differences between metaphylactic antimicrobials, and metaphylactic antimicrobial options appear to offer different outcomes on BRD morbidity and mortality odds in feedlot cattle...|$|E
40|$|The {{macrolide}} <b>gamithromycin</b> (GAM) has {{the ability}} to accumulate in tissues of the respiratory tract. Consequently, GAM might be a suitable antibiotic to treat bacterial respiratory infections in poultry, such as Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale. As O. rhinotracheale infections are common in turkey flocks, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GAM in plasma, lung tissue, and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) of turkeys and to correlate them with pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics (PK/PD). The animal experiment was performed with 64 turkeys, which received either a subcutaneous (SC, n = 32) or an oral (PO, n = 32) bolus of 6 mg GAM/kg body weight (BW). GAM concentrations in plasma, lung tissue, and PELF were measured at different time points post administration (p. a.), and PK characteristics were determined using non-compartmental modeling. The maximum plasma concentration after PO administration was ten-fold lower than after SC injection (0. 087 and 0. 89 mu g/mL, respectively), whereas there was no difference in lung concentrations between both routes of administration. However, lung concentrations at day 1 p. a. were significantly higher than plasma levels for both routes of administration (2. 22 and 3. 66 mu g/g for PO and SC, respectively). Consequently, lung/plasma ratios were high, up to 50 and 80 after PO and SC administration, respectively. GAM could not be detected in PELF, although this might be attributed to the collection method of PELF in birds. The GAM minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 38 O. rhinotracheale strains; MIC 50 and MIC 90 were 2 and > 32 mu g/mL, respectively. PK/PD correlation for lung tissue demonstrated that the time above the MIC 90 of the susceptible population (2 mu g/mL) was 1 day after PO bolus and 3. 5 days after SC administration. The area under the curve (AUClast) /MIC ratios for lung tissue after SC and PO administration were 233 and 90, respectively. To conclude, GAM is highly distributed to lung tissue in turkey poults, suggesting that it has the potential to be used to treat respiratory infections such as O. rhinotracheale...|$|E
