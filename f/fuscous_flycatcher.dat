50|$|The <b>fuscous</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Cnemotriccus fuscatus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family, and {{the only member of}} the genus Cnemotriccus. It breeds from Colombia and Venezuela south to Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and on both Trinidad and Tobago. The <b>fuscous</b> <b>flycatcher</b> ranges in northern and eastern South America, including the entire Amazon Basin, and the Guianas; also all of Brazil except the very southeastern border area with Uruguay.|$|E
50|$|Bird species {{recorded}} at the reserve include Scale-throated hermit, Pileated parrot, Black-capped foliage-gleaner, Pale-browed treehunter, Streaked xenops, Olivaceous woodcreeper, Dusky-tailed antbird, White-shouldered fire-eye, Speckle-breasted antpitta, Greenish tyrannulet, <b>Fuscous</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Blue manakin, Greenish schiffornis, Chestnut-crowned becard, Rufous-browed peppershrike, Golden-rumped euphonia and Red-crowned ant tanager.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fuscous</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is 14.5 cm {{long and}} weighs 11.9g, {{with a long}} tail. The upperparts are plain brown with darker brown wings and two buff wing bars. There is an obvious long whitish supercilium, and the bill is black. The breast is grey-brown and the abdomen is pale yellow. Sexes are similar. There are other races, differing {{in the tone of}} the upperpart or underpart colour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuscous</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are {{inconspicuous}} birds, {{tending to}} keep to undergrowth perches from which they sally forth to catch insects, (hawking). The call is a light chip, and the song a chip-weeti-weeti-weetiyee, replaced in southern races by an explosive version at dawn, pit-pit-peedit.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Fuscous</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Cnemotriccus fuscatus) is a {{medium-sized}} Tyrannidae widespread in South America. Despite its large distribution, {{there have been}} very few studies on its diet, especially in different habitats. This study presents data on diet variation in three habitats in the Pantanal wetlands {{in the state of}} Mato Grosso, Brazil. The specimens were captured through a mist-netting programme between February 2000 and May 2010, in the Retiro Novo Farm, in the Pocon&# 233; municipality. Birds were captured in three vegetation types: Landizal, Cambarazal and Cordilheira. Tartar emetic was used to obtain the regurgitation samples identified at order level. We captured 61 individuals (21, 26 and 14 in the above described habitats, respectively). Diet of C. fuscatus differed between the three habitats. Ants and beetles were the most relevant prey items either in numerical frequency (NF) or in frequency of occurrence (OF), in terms of the overall diet (NF = 27. 34 % and 37. 89 %; OF = 36. 06 % and 75. 4 %, respectively). However, in Cordilheira, seeds and beetles dominated the NF (21. 8 % and 38. 1 %, respectively) and OF (28. 5 % and 85. 7 %, respectively). Cnemotriccus fuscatus was found to have an omnivorous diet, although in Cambarazal, individuals preyed exclusively on arthropods. The present study provides an important contribution to the knowledge of the diet of a poorly studied Neotropical bird...|$|E
