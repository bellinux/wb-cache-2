40|$|Gauge bosons are {{fundamental}} fields that mediate the electroweak interaction of leptons and quarks. The underlying mechanism explaining how gauge bosons acquire mass is neither definitively settled nor universally accepted and several competing theories coexist. The prevailing paradigm is that boson masses arise {{as a result}} of coupling to a hypothetical scalar field called the Higgs boson. Within the current range of accelerator technology, compelling evidence for the Higgs boson is missing. We discuss in this paper a derivation of boson masses that bypasses the Higgs mechanism and is formulated on the basis of complexity theory. The key premise of our work is that the dynamics of the gauge field may be described as a stochastic process caused by the short range of electroweak interaction. It is found that, if this process is driven by Levy statistics, mass generation in the electroweak sector can be naturally accounted for. Theoretical predictions are shown to agree well with experimental data.

40|$|Numerical {{solution}} of nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) is frequently encountered in computational science and engineering. The applicability of most existing methods {{is limited by}} matrix structures, property of eigen-solutions, size of the problem, etc. This paper aims to break those limitations and to develop robust and universal NEP solvers for large-scale engineering applications. The novelty lies in two aspects. First, a rational interpolation approach (RIA) is proposed based on the Keldysh theorem for holomorphic matrix functions. Comparing with the existing contour integral approach (CIA), the RIA provides the possibility to select sampling points in more general regions and has advantages in improving accuracy and reducing computational cost. Second, a resolvent sampling scheme using the RIA is proposed for constructing reliable search spaces for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, based on which a robust eigen-solver, denoted by RSRR, is developed for solving general NEPs. RSRR can be easily implemented and parallelized. The advantages of the RIA {{and the performance of}} RSRR are demonstrated by a variety of benchmark and practical problems.

40|$|For a (partially) {{ordered set}} X, a mapping f: X 7 → X is an {{endomorphism}} of X {{if it is}} order preserving or monotone, that is, if x ≤ y in X implies that f(x) ≤ f(y) as well. We will let End(X) denote the set of endomorphisms on X and let e(X) = |End(X) |. This set can be regarded both as a semigroup, under composition, and as an ordered set, under the pointwise order. We will only be concerned with finite ordered sets, so an endomorphism is an automorphism provided that it is bijective, or, equivalently, injective or surjective. Let Aut(X) denote the group of automorphisms of X, and let a(X) = |Aut(X) |. Here, we report progress on the following conjecture about the ratio e(X) /a(X); the results reported here, together with their proofs and related work, are contained in [2]. Conjecture: Rival and Rutkowski – 1991 [5]: For any sequence (Pn) of pairwise nonisomorphic ordered sets limn→∞ e(Pn) a(Pn) The conjecture was originally an afterthought – Rival and Rutkowski were initially motivated to compare the numbers of maps with fixed points to those without. How-ever, it seems obvious that endomorphisms will vastly outnumber automorphisms (for several reasons). In fact, {{it is quite possible}} that the following is valid in general. Amplification: Trotter – mid- 90 ’s: There exists c> 1 such that for all ordered sets X of size n ≥ 2 <b>e(X)</b> a(X) ≥ <b>cn.</b> The amplification does hold for many classes of finite ordered sets, and it may be true overall.

40|$|A {{sleeping}} beauty in diffusion {{indicates that the}} information, can be ideas or innovations, will experience a hibernation before a sudden spike of popularity and it is widely found in citation history of scientific publications. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the {{sleeping beauty}} is an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion and even more inspiring, there exist two consecutive sleeping beauties in the entire lifetime of propagation, suggesting that the information, including scientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes, will go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attracts some attention, and then it falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity peak. Further explorations on this phenomenon show that intervals between two wake ups follow an exponential distribution and the second wake up generally reaches its peak at a higher velocity. In addition, higher volume of the first wake up will lead to even much higher popularity of the second wake up with great odds. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is presented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media.

40|$|Evidence broadly {{confirms}} that EU harmonization of food regulations {{can be considered}} as a trade-promoting and market-integrating instrument in the Single market. However, little is known on how these particular trade liberalization measured may impact total factor productivity (TFP). One of the general presumptions is that trade liberalization has a positive impact on productivity through the effect of competitive pressures to which domestic firms are exposed. For instance, as a result of lowering or removing regulatory barriers to trade, entry costs of foreign and domestic competitors decrease. This leads to more competitive pressures which have a downward effect on prices (and markups) and whereby a better reallocation of inputs are developed. Our contribution on this research is to test these predictions in one empirical framework. First, we lay out the empirical underpinnings on TFP measurement under markups and variable returns to scale. The estimation enables us to verify the cyclical behavior of the market structure and scale economies over time. Second, our empirical model (panel) disentangles the impact of harmonization of regulations on markups and markups on TFP.
