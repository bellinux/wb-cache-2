5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' <b>Insurance</b> <b>Board</b> approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, {{health care}} is a {{responsibility}} of the provinces. In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, up to $500 for each hearing aid. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. Audiometric testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance or in some cases through government programs such as Veterans Affairs Canada or Workplace Safety & <b>Insurance</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|E

50|$|He {{worked as}} a general {{practitioner}} and specialist for pulmonary disease in Berlin from 1895 to 1911. Friedeberg contributed to Sozialistischer Akademiker from early 1895 {{to the end of}} 1896, and from 1897 on, {{he was a member of}} the press commission of Sozialistische Monatshefte, both periodicals, which attempted to draw intellectuals to socialism and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Friedeberg was active in the establishment of health insurance for the working class in Berlin. The German socialist movement was just discovering the health insurance movement and starting to be active within it, both to win access to medical treatment for the working class and as a means of disseminating socialist ideas. In 1899, Friedeberg helped establish Berlin's Central Commission of Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Boards,</b> which then organized the first Congress of German Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Boards.</b> Additionally, he served as a member of the city council of Berlin from 1901 (or 1902 according to some sources) to 1904, making him a top SPD leader in Germany's capital.|$|R
25|$|The statute {{expanded}} MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) {{coverage for}} children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower group insurance rates. The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance {{for a short period}} in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan <b>insurance</b> <b>board</b> ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze the premiums. Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute but that has not happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, the AFL-CIO {{declared}} April 28 “Workers' Memorial Day” to honour {{the hundreds}} of thousands of working people killed and injured on the job every year. Following the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Congress in 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was formed in 1971. [...] In 1984, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) did the same in Canada. The Canadian Labour Congress declared an annual day of remembrance in 1985 on April 28, which is the anniversary of a comprehensive Workers' Compensation Act (refer to the entry Workplace Safety & <b>Insurance</b> <b>Board),</b> passed in 1914. [...] In 1991, the Canadian parliament passed an Act respecting a National Day of Mourning for persons killed or injured in the workplace, making April 28 an official Workers’ Mourning Day.|$|E
2500|$|She {{first began}} to exhibit {{symptoms}} {{at the age of}} 29 but continued to work in the asbestos mill until 22 July 1922, when she was certified unfit to work. Because Kershaw's medical certificate (produced by her local physician Dr Walter Scott Joss) recorded the diagnosis as [...] "asbestos poisoning" [...] she was ineligible for National Health Insurance sickness benefits. As the illness was linked to her occupation, the insurers advised her that she should instead seek sickness benefits from her employers, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and wrote to Turner Brothers on her behalf on several occasions. However, Turner Brothers refused to pay any benefits because asbestos-related illness was not a recognised occupational disease at that time, and instructed their insurance company to [...] "repudiate the claim" [...] as it would be [...] "exceedingly dangerous" [...] to accept [...] "any liability whatever in such a case." [...] Percy George Kenyon, Turner's works' manager at Rochdale, wrote to Dr Joss demanding that he [...] "inform us what you have said to Miss [...] Kershaw about suffering from Asbestos poisoning" [...] and then wrote to the medical <b>insurance</b> <b>board</b> stating that [...] "We repudiate the term [...] "Asbestos Poisoning". Asbestos is not poisonous and no definition or knowledge of such a disease exists.
