5|$|To {{reliably}} {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB accessory peripherals now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a <b>host</b> <b>device</b> and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.|$|E
25|$|SD {{cards and}} host devices {{initially}} communicate through a synchronous one-bit interface, where the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> provides a clock signal that strobes single bits {{in and out}} of the SD card. The <b>host</b> <b>device</b> thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can abort the dialogue.|$|E
25|$|All SD cards let the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> {{determine}} how much information the card can hold, and the specification of each SD family gives the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> a guarantee of the maximum capacity a compliant card reports.|$|E
25|$|<b>Host</b> <b>devices</b> that {{comply with}} newer {{versions}} of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards. For example, SDXC <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> also accept standard SD cards.|$|R
25|$|SDHC <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> are {{required}} to accept older SD cards. However, older <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> do not recognize SDHC or SDXC memory cards, although some devices can do so through a firmware upgrade. Older Windows operating systems released before Windows 7 require patches or service packs to support access to SDHC cards.|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an upcoming}} efficient networking computing environment. Our work proposes sharing an application across various clients {{of a host}} system via cloud computing. The sharing is performed between the host storage system and the remote storage system in a cloud computing environment. The <b>Host</b> storage <b>device</b> of the <b>host</b> system is updated to retrieve the application from the remote storage device that is shared through cloud computing environment. The application now can be accessed by the <b>host</b> processing <b>devices.</b> The application can be implemented on the <b>host</b> processing <b>device</b> without requiring any installation of the application on the <b>host</b> processing <b>device.</b> A bunch of function calls are performed between the operating system of the <b>host</b> processing <b>device</b> and the application residing on the <b>host</b> storage <b>device.</b> The system has a cloud interface between remote and host machines to update the <b>host</b> storage <b>device</b> about any changes in the application at the remote storage device. This leads to the better utilization of the cloud bandwidth and the host resources such as storage, processors etc...|$|R
25|$|A <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can lock an SD card using a {{password}} {{of up to}} 16bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> except that it rejects commands {{to read and write}} data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but {{there is no way to}} gain access to the existing data.|$|E
25|$|Cards that {{comply with}} UHS show Roman numerals 'I', 'II' or 'III' {{next to the}} SD card logo, and report this {{capability}} to the <b>host</b> <b>device.</b> Use of UHS-I requires that the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> command the card to drop from 3.3-volt to 1.8-volt operation over the I/O interface pins and select the four-bit transfer mode, while UHS-II requires 0.4-volt operation.|$|E
25|$|At initial {{power-up}} or card insertion, the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> selects {{either the}} Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> may issue a command {{to switch to}} the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.|$|E
50|$|CE-ATA is {{electrically}} {{and physically}} compatible with MMC specification. CE-ATA uses MMC connector on <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> and matching flex cable or circuit connection on CE-ATA hard disk drives.|$|R
2500|$|Older <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> {{generally}} do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card, there are several factors that arise: ...|$|R
25|$|UHS memory cards {{work best}} with UHS <b>host</b> <b>devices.</b> The {{combination}} lets the user record HD resolution videos with tapeless camcorders while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.|$|R
25|$|Use of an SDIO card {{requires}} the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> be {{designed for the}} input/output functions the card provides.|$|E
25|$|Early SDSC host {{devices that}} assume 512-byte blocks {{therefore}} {{do not fully}} support the insertion of 2GB or 4GB cards. In some cases, the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can read data that happens to reside in the first 1GB of the card. If the assumption {{is made in the}} driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any <b>host</b> <b>device</b> might not support a 4GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2GB is the maximum for these cards.|$|E
25|$|A newer card {{may offer}} greater {{capacity}} than the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).|$|E
50|$|Every network host is a {{physical}} network node (i.e. a network device), but not every physical network node is a <b>host.</b> Network <b>devices</b> such as modems, hubs and network switches are not necessarily assigned network addresses (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and consequently may not {{be considered to be}} network <b>hosts.</b> <b>Devices</b> such as network printers and hardware routers have addresses, but since they are not general-purpose computers, they are sometimes not considered to be hosts.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} the version 2.0 (SDHC) {{specification}} was completed in June 2006, vendors had already devised 2GB and 4GB SD cards, either as specified in Version 1.01, or by creatively reading Version 1.00. The resulting cards do not work correctly in some <b>host</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|A Bluetooth-based indoor {{positioning}} system using off-theshelf low-cost stationary beacons and mobile <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> is described. The system permits low-cost, rapid prototyping of applications where room-level location detection is sufficient. The technical details {{required to make}} such a system work in practice are described...|$|R
25|$|A <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can ask any {{inserted}} SD {{card for}} its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify {{the number of}} memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The <b>host</b> <b>device</b> multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) {{with the number of}} bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can {{command the}} SD card to become {{read-only}} (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.|$|E
25|$|Full-size SD cards do not {{fit into}} the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect {{the ability to use}} one format in a <b>host</b> <b>device</b> {{designed}} for the other.|$|E
5000|$|The initial CompactFlash {{specification}} envisaged {{a higher}} maximum capacity than other card formats. For this reason, many early CompactFlash <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> are usable with modern multi-gigabyte memories, where users of other families such as Secure Digital {{have had to}} migrate to SDHC and SDXC.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the version 2.0 (SDHC) {{specification}} was completed in June 2006, vendors had already devised 2 GB and 4 GB SD cards, either as specified in Version 1.01, or by creatively reading Version 1.00. The resulting cards do not work correctly in some <b>host</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|DPWS defines an {{architecture}} in which devices run {{two types of}} services: hosting services and hosted services. Hosting services are directly associated to a device, and play {{an important part in}} the <b>device</b> discovery process. <b>Hosted</b> services are mostly functional and depend on their <b>hosting</b> <b>device</b> for discovery.|$|R
25|$|Modern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88W, if the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> {{supports}} bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II. Minimum {{power consumption}} {{in the case of}} a UHS-II host is 0.72W.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other types}} of flash memory card, an SD card of any SD family is a block-addressable storage device, in which the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.|$|E
25|$|The SD {{protocol}} {{envisioned the}} ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The <b>host</b> <b>device</b> would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card {{to respond to the}} command using its unique serial number.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} tools for {{collecting}} system data from <b>hosts</b> and <b>devices</b> using the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). [...] Most computers and networked devices {{will have some}} form of SNMP access. Interpretation of the SNMP data from a <b>host</b> or <b>device</b> requires either a specialized tool (typically extra software [...] from the vendor) or a Management information base (MIB), a mapping of commands/data references to the various data elements the <b>host</b> or <b>device</b> provides. The advantage of SNMP for monitoring is its low bandwidth requirements and universal usage in the industries.|$|R
50|$|At its {{inception}} in June 2008, Ibercivis had 3,000 registered users hosting its various projects. By December 2012, this figure had risen to over 19,800, distributed across 124 countries. There are around 55,000 individual <b>hosting</b> <b>devices</b> registered with the project, of which over 3,600 are active on a weekly basis.|$|R
50|$|PDMI {{connector}} {{is intended}} {{to serve as a}} common interconnection between docking devices and displays and portable/nomadic devices with media playback capability. Intended <b>host</b> <b>devices</b> include docking stations for home A/V equipment, in-car entertainment systems, digital media kiosks, and hotel/in-flight entertainment systems, where PDMI aims to replace the ubiquitous iPod cradle connector.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to be fully {{compliant}} with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect exFAT on cards larger than 32GB. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device supports FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the <b>host</b> <b>device.</b> This bears a risk of accidental loss of data, as a <b>host</b> <b>device</b> may treat a card with an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and reformat the card.|$|E
25|$|Later {{versions}} state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) {{to indicate}} 1024 bytes, {{so that the}} above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the <b>host</b> <b>device</b> shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512bytes.|$|E
25|$|The command {{interface}} {{is an extension}} of the MultiMediaCard (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a <b>host</b> <b>device</b> can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.|$|E
