5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give {{up the idea of}} marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the Car of Tomorrow, and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> compete.|$|E

5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|Nix started Bradford's {{first two}} games of the 2008–09 season in place of Joe Colbeck, who was {{suspended}} following a red card against Milton Keynes Dons {{at the end of}} the previous campaign. However, when Colbeck was available again, Nix was dropped to the substitutes' bench, with new signing Paul McLaren partnering Lee Bullock, who had returned from injury, in central midfield. Nix struggled for form but was also playing with an ankle injury, which eventually forced him to take a hospital scan in November. He was one of six club midfielders to be injured at the time. He returned to action later that month as a second-half substitute against his father's former team Rotherham United, at the Don Valley Stadium. However, he struggled to hold down a regularly place in the side because of new midfielders signed during the course of the season, and he was released {{at the end of the}} campaign having played less than half the games that he played in his first year at City. Nix was offered the chance to return to Bradford by McCall <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find a new club but he rejected the invitation.|$|E

Although Osborn said nothing, his face got red and the veins on his forehead swelled, and Gerald found his silence strangely daunting. When the latter stopped, Osborn got up and stood, rather shakily, with his hand clenched.|$|R

5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E

50|$|Between 763 and 766, Waiofar {{withdrew his}} garrisons from the cities (civitates) of Poitiers, Limoges, Saintes, Périgueux and Angoulême. Most of these fortifications were {{restored}} after the cities were occupied by Pepin's forces. Archibald Lewis believes it was Pepin who destroyed the walls {{after he had}} conquered the cities <b>if</b> <b>he</b> judged <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hold them. His interpretation is contradicted by Bernard Bachrach, who believes it was Waiofar who, before abandoning his cities, destroyed their defences and walls to prevent Pepin from using them against him.|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Jones and Rosario had {{been marked by}} domestic violence, and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted {{to break into the}} apartment, even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth drove her roommate to court to get a protective order that required Jones {{to stay away from the}} apartment. Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get back together with Rosario.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December the Rates Bill was published, {{with the}} new Environment Secretary Patrick Jenkin making it clear he would resign <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get it enacted. It was {{anticipated}} that the Bill would be highly controversial especially {{with members of the}} House of Lords and Jenkin was said to have reminded them of the Salisbury Convention which prevented the Lords from rejecting any Bill mentioned in an election manifesto. The Bill was soon under criticism in Parliament by Conservative MPs Geoffrey Rippon and Anthony Beaumont-Dark, and outside it by David Howell.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{seizing the}} throne, Amanullah had his uncle Nasrullah arrested for Habibullah's murder {{and had him}} sentenced to life imprisonment. Nasrullah had been {{the leader of a}} more {{conservative}} element in Afghanistan and his treatment rendered Amanullah's position as Amir somewhat tenuous. By April 1919 he realised that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find a way to placate the conservatives he would be unlikely to maintain his hold on power. Looking for a diversion from the internal strife in the Afghan court and sensing advantage in the rising civil unrest in India following the Amritsar massacre, Amanullah decided to invade British India.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{he thought}} that either {{of those who had}} been named as the object of hatred to these unruly men might {{ultimately}} fall a victim to the feeling to which their actions had given rise in the country, is another question. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> did, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> prevent it--nor was it his especial business to attend to it; but he felt tolerably sure that to whatever bad feelings hardships and cruelty might have given rise in Thady's breast, he would not now gratify them by such atrocious means as those which McGovery's statement had induced him to apprehend.|$|R

Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna at the Augustinerkirche on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to today's 240,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{resisted}} the second demand: that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor {{to work in}} parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray {{did not want to}} share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That {{turned out not to be}} so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.|$|E
25|$|Police have {{recovered}} considerable forensic {{evidence in the}} case, but {{so far it has}} served to eliminate one likely suspect, a former boyfriend of her roommate who reportedly expressed anger and resentment toward Hedgepeth, even supposedly threatening to kill her <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> reunite with her roommate. His DNA, however, did not match that left at the scene. A note left at the scene, suggesting the writer was jealous, is also believed to have been written by the killer; it was among a large group of documents released by police two years after the crime, following a court action brought by several local media outlets.|$|E

That changed however, when the manager of the Lions, Osamu Higashio, an accomplished pitcher in his own right, met with Matsuzaka for dinner. At the dinner, Higashio gave Matsuzaka his winning ball for career win number 200. Matsuzaka accepted it and allowed himself to be drafted by the Lions.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot for}} the show was {{recorded}} in 1967, featuring Clement Freud, Derek Nimmo, Beryl Reid and Wilma Ewart as panellists.

Parsons did not want the job and only reluctantly took it, just for the pilot episode. After the show settled in, again he found himself in the role of a straight man for the panellists. Although executives at the BBC disliked the pilot, its producer, David Hatch, threatened to resign <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> oversee a full series. Not wishing to lose Hatch, the BBC acquiesced.|$|E
25|$|Butkus' {{retirement}} {{came with}} four years remaining on {{a five-year contract}} with the Bears, which was to pay him $115,000 per year through 1977, came with a no-cut, no-trade clause, and was payable even if surgery was needed. The contract also promised necessary medical and hospital care which, according to Butkus, the Bears neglected to provide him, causing irreparable damage to his knee. The Bears also informed him {{he would not be}} paid <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play. He filed a suit against the Bears' team doctor in May 1974 asking for $600,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. It was eventually settled out of court when the Bears agreed to pay Butkus the full value of his contract. The episode caused a rift between Butkus and Bears owner George Halas, and the two did not speak for the next five years.|$|E
