The majority of the papers published on the microwave curing of reinforced epoxy resin composites have used widely available DGEBA type resins and amine hardeners such as 4, 4 ’-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). This paper investigates the use of two epoxy systems where the choice of resin and hardener was based on their measured dielectric loss factors. System 1 contained a resin and hardener with higher loss factors than those used in System 2. The two systems were formulated with polyetherimide (PEI) as a toughening agent. Unidirectional carbon fibre prepregs were prepared from both systems. Composites were laid up from these prepregs which were then cured in three different ways: autoclave curing, partial autoclave curing followed by microwave post-curing, and microwave curing.
