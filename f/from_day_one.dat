5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>one</b> without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program.

25|$|In July 2009, Lisch {{signed with}} the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League.

Beveridge took Lisch under his wing <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>one</b> and became a father figure with absolute faith in him. Lisch debuted with a 12-point effort on September 25, 2009 against the Wollongong Hawks.
