2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, the Ranger {{received}} minor updates to the grille, hood, {{and front}} bumper. New front bucket seats were also added in 2004 {{to meet the}} new U.S. Federal safety requirements. It retained the dashboard lines of the previous years trucks with an instrument cluster change. In 2006, the Ranger received more minor updates to the grille, <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> and taillights, along with a bigger rear Ford logo that was now centered in the tailgate. It also received new larger mirrors {{similar to those found}} on other Ford trucks and SUVs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the Fairlane {{line was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the new}} Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn signal indicator in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod {{directly in front of}} the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right turn signal indicator, were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative [...] "clock delete" [...] panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{production}} of the [...] "Type 53", there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage. In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile. [...] Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper. In 1979, the one-piece [...] "flag" [...] style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror. There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called [...] "Sidewinder", [...] "Sidewinder II", [...] "Champagne Edition", [...] "Champagne Edition II" [...] and the [...] "S". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 [...] "S" [...] versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This [...] "S" [...] model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 [...] "S" [...] versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the [...] "S" [...] non-"S" [...] vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the [...] "Storm" [...] models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.|$|E

5000|$|Changes for the 1968 model {{increased}} safety with a two-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel, {{along with}} newly introduced shoulder belts. Other changes included <b>front</b> and rear <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> [...] "FORD" [...] lettering removed from hood, rearview mirror moved from frame to windshield, a 302 cuin L V8 engine was now available, and C-Stripe graphics were added.|$|R
5000|$|The 480 was {{produced}} in Born, Netherlands, at the factory that built DAF cars, including the DAF 66 based Volvo 66, and later, the Volvo 300 Series. The 480 shared the platform of the Volvo 440 and 460 models. It was originally planned for the North American market (evidenced by its <b>front</b> and rear <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> not used on European automobiles).|$|R
5000|$|The Park Avenue was {{available}} in Europe from 1991 to 1996 and varied from the North American version by featuring a truncated taillamps with separate amber turn signal indicators and red brake lamps, wider numberplate bezel, fitment of rear red fog lamps, headlamps with different lens pattern, white <b>front</b> <b>side</b> running <b>markers,</b> amber <b>front</b> turn signal indicators, side turn signal repeaters, [...] "flagpole" [...] external rear-view mirrors (mirrors on US version are fixed and do not turn), stronger seat belt and anchors, [...] "softer" [...] air bags, metric speedometer and gauges. They are {{to comply with the}} European regulatory and safety standards.|$|R
2500|$|By contrast, {{the three}} [...] "AXI" [...] cars had further {{modifications}} to the amber front door lights, which were exchanged for clear lenses of the same style. Perhaps the most significant alteration on the [...] "AXI" [...] cars is the deletion of the <b>front</b> and rear <b>side</b> <b>markers.</b> These are replaced by a single small round European style indicator side repeater, situated on the front wing (fender). The body rubstrips are also of a different configuration in order to cover the areas which would otherwise have had federal <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lenses fitted.|$|R
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the <b>front</b> amber <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights may be wired to flash with the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|R
25|$|In the US, amber {{front and}} red rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps and retroreflectors are required. The law {{initially}} required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1968. This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1970. These side-facing devices make the vehicle's presence, position {{and direction of}} travel clearly visible from oblique angles. The lights are wired so as to illuminate whenever the vehicles' parking and taillamps are on, including when the headlamps are being used. <b>Front</b> amber <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> in the United States may be wired so as to flash in synchronous phase or opposite-phase with the turn signals, but {{are not required to}} flash at all. <b>Side</b> <b>markers</b> are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the US and Canada. If installed, they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger horizontal angle than US <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals (but are not required to flash), and they must be amber at the front and rear, except rear <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> may be red if they are grouped, combined, or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1968 model, the {{horizontal}} division bar {{was removed from}} the grille. A fine cross hatched insert was framed by a segmented chrome surround.

50|$|In early 2006, {{prior to}} formal {{importation}} to the United States, a specialty firm—G and K Auto conversions of Santa Ana California received DOT, NHTSA, and EPA approval to market a modified European specification Smart Fortwo in the US. Modifications for the grey market vehicles included DOT certified headlights, <b>front</b> and rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights, reinforced doors for additional side impact protection, an odometer in miles rather than kilometres, and soft padding {{on the interior}} pillars and ceiling. Approximately 1,000 model year 2004, 2005, and 2006 cars were imported.|$|R

5000|$|For 1968, all new US {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with <b>front</b> and rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights. Chrysler bumpers, grille, hood, deck lid, rear fascia and lamps all changed significantly, although side sheet metal, wagon tailgate and rear lamps remained the same. Functionally, {{there were few}} changes. Better breathing cylinder heads boosted output of the standard 383 cu. in. 2BBL V8 to 290 HP. Front disc brakes returned to the options list, while front drum brakes and size 8.85x14 tires were standard. Inside, standard notchback and optional 50/50 front seats continued, sharing seat and door trim patterns with the Newport Custom series.

40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments.

Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps, viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of balancing the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, the pitch of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode and the sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO, the fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally {{that in the case}} of the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport is shifted from the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side.</b> Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to the traditional front emitter cell design.
