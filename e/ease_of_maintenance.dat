5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Kclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-4 tank {{locomotive}} {{designed in}} 1914 by Richard Maunsell for express passenger duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower loading gauge. They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and improve upon the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The locomotives were based on the GWR 4300class, improved by the Midland Railway's ideals of simplicity and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E

5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The YF-22 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Because Lockheed's submission was selected {{as one of the}} winners, the company, through its Skunk Works division, assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage, as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing, with the center fuselage, weapons bays, tail and landing gears built by General Dynamics. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span trailing edge, and, whereas the YF-23 had two tail surfaces, the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart. Two examples of each prototype air vehicle (PAV) were built for the Demonstration-Validation phase: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines.|$|E

40|$|Railway bridges {{currently}} {{encounter the}} challenges of increasing the load capacity while the environmental sustainability should be achieved. However, it has been realised that the environmental assessment of railway bridges has not been integrated into the decision-making process, the standard guideline and criterion is still missing in this field. Therefore, the implementation of life cycle assessment (LCA) method is introduced into railway bridges. This article provides a systematic bridge LCA model as a guideline to quantify the environmental burdens for the railway bridge structures. A comparison case study between two alternative designs of Banafjäl Bridge is further carried out through the whole life cycle, with the consideration <b>of</b> several key <b>maintenance</b> and end-of-life scenarios. Six impact categories are investigated by using the LCA CML 2001 method and the known life cycle inventory database. Results show that the fixed-slab bridge option has a better environmental performance than the ballasted design due to the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenances.</b> The initial material manufacture stage {{is responsible for the}} largest environmental burden, while the impacts from the construction machinery and material transportations are ignorable. Sensitivity analysis illustrates the maintenance scenario planning and steel recycling have the significant influence on the final results other than the traffic disturbances.

25|$|Early on, the {{decision}} to adopt four engines for a feeder airliner rather than two was viewed as atypical by some commentators. Advantages of adopting the four engine configuration include greater redundancy and superior takeoff performance from short runways, {{as well as in}} hot and high conditions.
