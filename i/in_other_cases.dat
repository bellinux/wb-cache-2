5|$|Criticising {{mainstream}} Western {{education as}} counterproductive to {{the ethos of}} the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools {{for the education of}} children, although <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases</b> such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.|$|E
5|$|Fraternisation—peaceful and {{sometimes}} friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature in quiet front-line {{sectors of the}} Western Front. In some areas, it manifested as a passive inactivity, where both sides would refrain from overtly aggressive or threatening behavior, while <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases</b> it extended to regular conversation or even visits from one trench to another.|$|E

5|$|A typical protein-coding gene {{is first}} copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E

5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|By 1919, the White armies were {{in retreat}} {{and by the}} start of 1920 were {{defeated}} on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extant of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In some cases—such as the north-eastern European nations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland—the Soviets recognised their independence and concluded peace treaties. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although fighting in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which one party will surrender its registration.

5|$|Haas {{suggests}} that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer (or three, if Mesoamerica is included as a separate case). While <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> the idea of government would have been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was invented. Other archaeologists have rejected such claims as hyperbolic.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases</b> she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and {{is said to be the}} mother of all the goddesses and gods.|$|E
5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases</b> there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects.

5|$|The {{case set}} a legal {{precedent}} which has shaped copyright law {{to the present}} day. It established the common law doctrine of fair abridgement, which was cited <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> ultimately building up {{to the idea of}} fair use. The opinion also recognised the author's right to a work through the nature of the labour it took to produce it, shifting copyright away from publishing rights and towards the idea of serving the greater good by encouraging the production of new, useful works.|$|E
5|$|The {{confiscation}} of Jewish property gave Göring {{the opportunity}} to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>cases,</b> he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via Pyrkal in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.
