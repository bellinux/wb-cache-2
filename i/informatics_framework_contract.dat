40|$|An <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> for {{sustainability}} {{analysis in}} urban transportation planning is developed in this paper. The framework consists of sustainability indicators, structured impact analysis, a general procedure, and a conceptual <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> which organises all these {{elements in a}} decision support system. In deriving sustainability indicators and structuring impact analysis, specific attention is given to comparisons between a trip-based approach and an activity-based approach, so that drawbacks of the conventional trip-based approach and potential of the activity-based approach are manifested {{in the context of}} sustainability analysis. Implications to the design of a decision support system for sustainability analysis are also discussed in terms of database and model base designs...|$|R
40|$|Bioinformatics {{resources}} {{should provide}} simple and flexible support for genomics research. A {{huge amount of}} gene mapping data, micro-array expression data, expressed sequence tags (EST), BAC sequence data and genome sequence data are already, or will soon be available {{for a number of}} livestock species. These species will have different requirements compared to typical biomedical model organisms and will need an <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> to deal with the data. In term of exploring complex-intertwined genomic data, the way to organize them will be addressed in this study. Therefore, we investigated two issues in this study: one is an independent <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> including both back end and front end; another is how an <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> simplifies the user interface to explore data. We have developed a fundamental <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> that makes it easy to organize and manipulate the complex relations between genomic data, and allow for query results to be presented via a user friendly web interface. A genome object-oriented framework (GOOF) was proposed with object-oriented Java technology and is independent of any database system. This framework seamlessly links the database system and web presentation components. The data models of GOOF collect the data relationships in order to provide users with access to relations across different types of data, meaning that users avoid constructing queries within the interface layer. Moreover, the module-based interface provided by GOOF could allow different users to access data in different interfaces and ways. In another words, GOOF not only gives a whole solution to informatics infrastructure, but also simplifies the organization of data modeling and presentation. In order to be a fast development solution, GOOF provides an automatic code engine by using meta-programming facilities in Java, which could allow users to generate a large amount of routine program codes. Moreover, the pre-built data layer in GOOF connecting with Chado simplifies the process to manage genomic data in the Chado schema. In summary, we studied the way to model genomic data into an <b>informatics</b> <b>framework,</b> a one-stop approach, to organize the data and addressed how GOOF constructs a bioinformatics infrastructure for users to access genomic data...|$|R

40|$|As {{biomedical}} research and healthcare continue to {{progress in the}} genomic/post genomic era {{a number of important}} challenges and opportunities exist in the broad area of biomedical informatics. In the context of this chapter we define bioinformatics as the field that focuses on information, data, and knowledge in the context of biological and {{biomedical research}}. The key challenges to bioinformatics essentially all relate to the current flood of raw data, aggregate information, and evolving knowledge arising from the study of the genome and its manifestation. In this chapter we first briefly review the source of this data. We then provide some <b>informatics</b> <b>frameworks</b> for organizing and thinking about challenges and opportunities in bioinformatics. We use then use one <b>informatics</b> <b>framework</b> to illustrate specific challenges from the informatics perspective. As a contrast we provide also an alternate perspective of the challenges and opportunities from the biological point of view. Both perspectives are then illustrated with case studies related to identifying and addressing challenges for bioinformatics in the real world.

40|$|Manufacturer-retailer {{relationships}} {{demonstrate the}} existence of asymmetric relationships among companies. A large number of consumer goods manufacturers negotiate and conclude contracts with {{a small number of}} highly concentrated grocery retailers. Consumer goods manufacturers have expertise in the areas of sourcing, producing and marketing branded products which are demanded by consumers. However, these manufacturers need to obtain listing for their brands within few grocery retailers which represent a significant share of their business. Many companies choose to become dependent on other strong companies because of the benefits that derive from their relationships, even if they are asymmetric. The benefits may include securing substantial business size, cost advantages or rationalisation of production and supply, simplification of business process and business reliance. Mergers & acquisitions, shifting economic conditions, rapid technological changes, as well as global sourcing create conditions for growing asymmetric interdependencies among companies. The present paper deals with an increasingly important question, which is about how companies are contracting in these asymmetric relationships. Based on empirical research in manufacturer-retailer relationships that covered the period between 2002 and 2005, the study examines how companies use contracts to manifest their joint choices over time. In general, contracts are manifestations of consent that give legal effect to business relationships. In asymmetric relationships, such as manufacturer-retailer relationships, companies choose to retreat from immediate <b>contracts</b> and arrange <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> (often called umbrella agreements) to balance the need for certainty with the wish to remain sufficiently flexible (Mouzas and Ford, 2006). A <b>framework</b> <b>contract</b> between two companies is not concerned with contractual decisions. Instead it articulates a domain consensus by specifying the scope of business; defines the basic rules and principles that govern an interdependent symbiosis between the parties and expresses the inherent goal incompatibility between parties by mapping the parties’ relevant interests as well as their business assumptions. This research provides empirical evidence of three intriguing findings: a) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> are made in established and continuing relationships and not in new untested relationships b) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> are more important for the stronger party in asymmetric relationships and c) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> do not mirror contractual decisions but provide a framework in which contractual decisions are made. The study discusses these findings and draws conclusions on the role of contracts and more widely on the nature of interdependence itself...|$|R
