However, it is not known how these processes interact with and / or influence each other. For this reason, Wageningen UR Livestock Research performed a study in which the effect of environmental conditions and dry matter content <b>of</b> the <b>droppings</b> on litter characteristics (pH, temperature, dry matter, nitrogen and ammonium content) and ammonia emission was investigated.

This study shows that it is possible to reduce ammonia emissions from broiler houses through management measures. Especially measures that increase the dry matter content of the litter and / or decrease the ammonium content of the litter and / or decrease the pH of the litter will reduce the ammonia emission...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This study {{investigated}} several physiological {{aspects of the}} water economy of the Sage Sparrow, Amphispiza belli nevadensis,as {{they relate to the}} ability of this species to inhabit xeric desert environments. When maintained in captivity on a dry diet without drinking water, Sage Sparrows gradually lost weight and died. During the period of water deprivation, motor activity increased and gross energy intake declined. However, Sage Sparrows were able to maintain their body weight when provided with only succulent foods as a source of water. When birds were transferred from ad libitum drinking water to a restricted water intake of either tap water (ca 2. 0 ml /day) or Tenebrio larvae (ca 2. 5 ml H₂O/day), excretory water losses were diminished by about 65 percent through a reduction in both the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> and excrement <b>dry</b> weight. At the same time, there was an increase in the percentage of assimilated energy, as indicated by the utilization coefficient. The renal capacity of the Sage Sparrow for concentrating electrolytes was not exceptional, with a mean maximum urine-plasma ratio of 2. 4 for chloride. Individuals lost weight on NaCl drinking solutions of 0. 25 M and above. The thermoneutral zone of the Sage Sparrow ranged from 28 to 37 °C with a standard metabolic rate of 7. 24 kcal/day (mean body wt = 18. 8 g; temperature = 35 °C). The temperature coefficient was 5. 6 percent. From 10 to 35 °C the passive rate of evaporative water loss was relatively, constant at ca 6. 5 mg/g/hr. Above 35 °C, evaporative cooling was initiated, and at high ambient temperatures and low humidities, Sage Sparrows were able to dissipate all their metabolic heat production by, evaporative cooling. There was indirect evidence for a reduction in evaporative water loss with water deprivation. The physiological adaptations of Sage Sparrows to water and heat stress were not unusual for small passerine birds, and were intermediate in relation to various species of desert and non-desert birds already investigated. The successful existence of Sage Sparrows in desert environments is probably dependent upon the utilization of succulent foods to satisfy their demands for water and on temperature-dependent behavioral responses which may reduce heat stress, thereby minimizing the need for evaporative cooling...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, {{notably in}} {{large parts of}} the Western World, many {{waterfowl}} populations have increased because of increased food availability. Not uncommonly, eutrophication in these areas may occur perhaps not only because of increased dropping loads but also because nutrients are more readily released from droppings than from fresh and decomposing plant material. We conducted an experiment to study this effect comparing the decay rate and nutrient release of fresh grass leaves with that <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> in water at 10, 20 and 30 °C. Using a two-component exponential decay model, allowing distinguishing between an easily decomposable (labile) and recalcitrant fraction of the material, we found that the labile carbon (C) fraction <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> decomposed faster than that of grass leaves, whereas the recalcitrant C decomposition rate was similar to that of grass leaves. Higher temperature increased C decomposition rates of the labile fractions. No temperature dependence was observed for the recalcitrant fractions. Surprisingly, grass leaves and droppings did not differ in the amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) released in the first 90 [*]days, i. e. more than 60 % of N and 40 % of P were released into the water column. Continuous mineralization of N and P predominated during decomposition of grass leaves, whereas a massive initial leaching was followed by immobilization and later mineralization during decomposition <b>of</b> <b>droppings.</b> All differences during decomposition of the litter types were attributed to the stoichiometric requirement of decomposers and their temperature sensitivity...|$|R

The direct association of the dietary protein content and the amount of water consumed are probably related to the well known fact that greater amounts of water are required for the metabolism of pro-tein than for carbohydrates or fats.

A study was conducted for 42 days on 240 broiler chicks treated with trace elements chelates with amino acids: B-TRAXIMRTEC Cu-I 30; B-TRAXIMRTEC Fe- 120. The broiler chicks were housed in cages (10 chicks per cage, 6 cages per group) and assigned to 4 groups (C, E 1, E 3 and E 3) fed on the same corn-soybean meal-based diet.
