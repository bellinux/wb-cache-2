5000|$|By 1963 Judd had {{established}} an essential vocabulary of forms — ‘stacks’, ‘boxes’ and ‘progressions’ — which preoccupied {{him for the}} next thirty years. Most of his output was in freestanding [...] "specific objects" [...] (the name of his seminal essay of 1965 published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), that used simple, often repeated forms to explore space {{and the use of}} space. Humble materials such as metals, industrial plywood, concrete and color-impregnated Plexiglas became staples of his career. Judd's first <b>floor</b> <b>box</b> structure was made in 1964, and his first <b>floor</b> <b>box</b> using Plexiglas followed one year later. Also by 1964, he began work on wall-mounted sculptures, and first developed the curved progression format of these works in 1964 as a development from his work on an untitled floor piece that set a hollow pipe into a solid wooden block. While Judd executed early works himself (in collaboration with his father, Roy Judd), in 1964 he began delegating fabrication to professional artisans and manufacturers (such as the industrial manufacturers Bernstein Brothers) [...] based on his drawings. In 1965, Judd created his first stack, an arrangement of identical iron units stretching from floor to ceiling.|$|E
50|$|The {{auditorium}} was {{a cavernous}} space, with textured panelling {{on both side}} walls, partially concealing curtained backing. Variable lighting was installed in the outer rim of the ceiling to play different coloured schemes over the walls during intermissions. A single set of tabs (curtains) revealed the immense screen. Foyer areas were reached via escalator from a ground <b>floor</b> <b>box</b> office with a fish pond in the upper foyer. A somewhat flatter screen was installed following the revival of Lawrence of Arabia {{to allow for a}} less distorted view of the desert skylines. Digital sound was installed in the 1990s, including ceiling speakers.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{built as}} a movie house, the Lyric opened {{at the corner of}} Third and Deweese Street (now Elm Tree Lane) in 1948. It became a {{thriving}} entertainment hub for Lexington's African-American community. Its architecture was a blend of Art Deco and Spanish Colonial Revival styles. Wrote Janet Holloway in an article for Smiley Pete Publishing,"Only the lobby's tile <b>floor,</b> <b>box</b> office and marquee retain the original look today. Architect Susan Hill has said she found few original features that could be preserved, but what is preserved are memories and a strong history of African American life in Lexington during those years."During the 1950s, the Lyric hosted performances by big-name jazz and R&B performers like Ray Charles, Count Basie, B.B. King, Wynonie Harris, Mercer Ellington, and Billy Brown. One Lexington resident claimed to have seen James Brown perform there. The theatre also hosted movies, vaudeville acts, fashion shows, local concerts, and pageants. Several small black-owned business, including ice cream bars and clothing stores, were also located in and around the theatre.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{project of}} the ongoing {{renovation}} and development was {{the building of a}} new south porch - door 12, accommodating a first floor restaurant, new ground <b>floor</b> <b>box</b> office and below ground loading bay. Although the exterior of the building was largely unchanged, the south steps leading down to Prince Consort Road were demolished to allow construction of an underground vehicle access and loading bay with accommodation for 3 HGVs carrying all the equipment brought by shows. The steps were then reconstructed around a new south porch, named The Meitar Foyer after a significant donation from Mr & Mrs Meitar. The porch was built in a similar scale and style to the three pre-existing porches at Door 3, 6 and 9: these works were undertaken by Taylor Woodrow Construction. The original steps featured in early scenes of 1965 film The Ipcress File. On 4 June 2004, the project received the Europa Nostra Award for remarkable achievement. The East (Door 3) and West (Door 9) porches were glazed and new bars opened along with ramps to improve disabled access. The Stalls were rebuilt in a four-week period in 2000 using steel supports allowing more space underneath for two new bars. 1534 unique pivoting seats were laid - with an addition of 180 prime seats. The Choirs were rebuilt at the same time. The whole building was redecorated in a style that reinforces its Victorian identity. New carpets were laid in the corridors - specially woven with a border that follows the elliptic curve of the building in the largest single woven design in the world.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} isolation performance of floating <b>floor</b> and floating <b>box</b> structures to control rail vibration transmission. Simple theoretical and experimental methods are developed {{to analyze the}} effects of stiffener beam, mass and arrangement of isolator on the fundamental natural frequency of the flexural vibration of floating <b>floor</b> and <b>box</b> structure. The vibration reduction performances of floating <b>floor</b> and <b>box</b> structure {{are found to be}} degraded by flexural vibration of the floor or supporting stiffener beam. From the results of vibration measurements; stiffener beams increase the fundamental natural frequency of flexural vibration of floating floor and enhance vibration isolation. Also they can further alleviate the effect of flexural vibration using optimum isolator arrangement effectively. The proposed floating box design achieved a vibration reduction of 15 - 30 dB in frequency region of critical rail vibration (30 - 200 Hz). Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|The loader {{also had}} a {{difficult}} job {{due to the lack}} of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the <b>floor</b> <b>boxes,</b> leaving the <b>floor</b> littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Herman Miller, Inc., and Legrand North America, an {{innovative}} manufacturer of electrical and network infrastructure solutions, announced a strategic alliance designed {{to broaden the}} reach of energy management strategies to fuel the adoption of flexible, sustainable spaces, ultimately reducing real estate and building operating costs while improving worker productivity. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, technology from Herman Miller’s Convia, Inc. subsidiary is embedded into Wiremold wire and cable management systems from Legrand. These include modular power and lighting distribution systems, <b>floor</b> <b>boxes,</b> poke-thru devices and architectural columns, which provide flexible, accessible power distribution to building owners and managers. Convia technology integrates a facility's power delivery and other infrastructure and technology applications, including lighting, HVAC, and occupancy and daylight harvesting sensors into an energy efficient, easy-to manage platform. Under the new alliance, “Convia-enabled” Wiremold systems enhanced this capability by adding control and monitoring of office plug loads (the amount of energy drawn by devices from an electrical outlet) and lighting loads. The “Convia-enabled” Wiremold offering provides a truly integrated control solution for end-to-end power applications.|$|R

50|$|The Astor Theatre is a {{good example}} of its type, {{illustrating}} the way in which many small picture theatres were developed from modest early beginnings and retains characteristics of its type such as long sight lines, a raked <b>floor,</b> foyer, projection <b>box</b> and confectionary counter.|$|R
5000|$|The chassis is {{fabricated}} from 18-20 swg steel, {{to incorporate}} the <b>floor</b> pan, <b>boxed</b> sills and the central tunnel box section. It forms a very robust structure. The fabrication is carried forwards in order to locate the front sub-frame, and a 1" [...] square tubular space frame extends beyond the rear bulkhead to carry the rear sub-frame. Welding {{was carried out by}} MIG for consistent quality and to avoid distortion. The chassis was fully jigged during manufacturing to ensure a true and accurate assembly.|$|R
50|$|Gradually {{functions}} such as {{the train}} depot, post office, and store were moved to different structures and the theater facilities were expanded. In 1898 the theater space was entirely reconfigured to have a sloped <b>floor,</b> balcony, and <b>boxes</b> flanking the proscenium stage, and more fire exits.|$|R
