40|$|Jute {{is popular}} {{for its ability}} to use in various forms in {{packaging}} and handicraft industry. The industry contributes greatly in the country’s economy and has potential to propel the economy in coming years. <b>Jute</b> <b>Textile</b> <b>Industry</b> {{is one of the major}} Industries in the Eastern India, particularly in West Bengal. Jute supports around 40 Lakh farm families and provides direct employment to 2. 6 Lakh Industrial Workers and 1. 4 Lakh in the tertiary sector. The production process in the Jute Industry goes through a variety of activities, which include cultivation of raw jute, processing of jute fibres, spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing and marketing of both, the raw jute and its finished products. So, Jute Industry is labour intensive and as such its labour-output ratio is also high in spite of various difficulties being faced by the industry. Capacity utilization of the industry is around 75 per cent. Jute industry contributes to the export earnings in the range of Rs. 1, 000 to Rs. 1, 200 crore annually. The paper is an attempt to highlight production & export performance of Indian jute industry in India as well as highlighting the export scenario of Indian jute production in recent years.

40|$|Abstract:-It is an {{established}} fact from Centuries together that the agriculture occupies the first place. The share of agriculture in GDP was 55. 4 {{percent during the}} year 1950 - 51. It has declined to 14 percent during the year 2013 - 14. It had provided employment opportunities to around 97 million persons in 1950 - 51. It has increased to 235 million in 2001. It has been supplying raw material to cotton and <b>jute</b> <b>textiles</b> <b>industries</b> etc. These industries depend on agriculture directly for it’s production of finished soils our agriculture contributes 14. 7 percent total export earnings. It has great significance for economic development. It helps the country to pay with regard to increased imports of machinery and raw materials. During the first plan Indian agriculture was in hopeless and deplorable condition. Nearly 70 percent of working population engaged in cultivation. The production of food grains increased from 51 million tonnes during 1950 - 51 to 241 million tonnes in the year 2010 - 11. Between 1951 and 2011, the production of food grains has increased by nearly five times...|$|R
40|$|Bangladesh {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} and densely {{populated}} deltas in the world. Due to institutional and financial limitations of the central government as well as past failures of the conventional top-down approach we suggest bottom-up strategies to increase the communities' ability to manage their own vulnerabilities. In a rural setting, these are typically the adverse effects of annual floods, contaminated drinking water, food insecurity, etc. The situation is further deteriorated by external forces such as natural disasters (cyclones or extreme floods) and market fluctuations (for example the decline of <b>jute</b> and <b>textile</b> <b>industries).</b> A strategy will be devised to address the provision of basic needs and to increase livelihood security in an integral way, using local knowledge and resources as a basis for development. This should combine solutions to urgent problems at the local level that could trigger long-term socio-economic development. Solutions should also have generic qualities {{so that they can be}} replicated in other areas, which might perhaps have a positive impact on the delta as a whole. Our approach is directed towards building a link between parties that are interested in improving the above-mentioned water-related issues. The goal is not to solve the problems but to provide a means to catalyse the development process. It includes two elements. First, a technological and institutional toolkit will compile the different traditional and external technologies, infrastructural solutions, organisational options into an online platform for collaboration, DeltaLink. Secondly, a strategy is outlined in which utilization of the DeltaLink platform by development professionals, NGOs and other organisations interested in participatory development in the water sector of Bangladesh is addressed...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{uses the}} ‘demand-side thesis’ {{to examine the}} decline of the Dundee jute industry. In particular, it examines the effect of international competition and the strategic response of the industry during the inter-war (1919 - 1939) and the post-war (1945 - 1960 s) period to counter this challenge. The strategic response is studied by examining strategies employed at the firm and the industry level. Strategy at the firm level is studied in the form of capability development using the capabilities approach. The thesis also makes an attempt to redress the issue of determinism in the capabilities approach which suggests that the pattern of capability development is governed by path-dependency. By drawing on the techniques employed in the history literature, this research identifies strategic options that were being considered by firms at the time of capability development and examine why certain alternatives were not pursued. This will bring to light aspects other then those associated with path-dependency that {{played a role in the}} pattern of capability development. The capabilities developed by firms during the two periods are compared and contrasted in order to understand the pattern over this period. These findings are juxtaposed with the British cotton <b>textile</b> <b>industry,</b> a related sector, to examine the effectiveness of the demand-side thesis in explaining {{the decline of the}} jute industry in particular and the <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> in general. This thesis makes contribution to three areas of literature: First, the thesis helps to further develop the demand-side framework by introducing a new case (Dundee jute industry) and developing a better understanding of strategic response within the <b>jute</b> and <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> in general. Second, this thesis contributes to the theoretical development of capabilities approach in two specific areas: a) it helps to address the issue of determinism inherent in the capabilities approach through the notion of path-dependency. This was done by also examining the strategic options that were available to firms while developing their capabilities and underlining the reasons for not pursuing them. b) the analysis sheds new light on the nature of branching of capabilities in an industry over a long period. Third, this research makes significant contribution to the existing literature on the business history of the Dundee jute industry, which is sparse. The contributions can be categorised into four key aspects which have not been examined in the current literature: a) period (inter-war and post-war), b) issue (systematic examination of the Dundee jute industry’s decline, strategic response and role of collective strategies), c) method (detailed study of individual firm’s strategies), and d) cross comparison of industry’s experience with related sectors (for example, the cotton industry). Focusing on these issues has helped to throw new light on the challenges, especially technological, facing the industry in developing its strategic response...|$|R

Comparing {{the results of the}} three alternative indicators, the German and Colombian <b>textile</b> <b>industries</b> improved their energy efficiency performance during the sample period. The energy consumption of each textile manufacturing activity corresponded to its production level, indicating the direct relation between output and energy use.

Potential explanatory factors, both systematic and industry-specific, for the dramatic industry decay are identified e. g. the disappearance of the primary industry, the continuous increase in the minimum wage in Romania, an acute labour shortage, the liberalisation and full integration of the <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> into GATT in 2005 and the recent global economic crisis. Furthermore we present empirical evidence of the linkages and causality between the overall economic growth of Romania, the evolution of the country’s <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> and the rate of growth of the minimum wage in the economy during June 2000 and January 2011. We found that the lagged minimum wage growth and lagged <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> sales growth together explain 80 % of the future rate of growth in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). All econometric tests conducted using our dataset agree that past and contemporaneous increases in minimum wages have had a significant negative impact on the <b>textile</b> <b>industry.</b> Finally, Granger causality tests reveal that the rate of growth in the GDP is driven by sales in the <b>textile</b> <b>industry,</b> and at the same time <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> sales also drives macroeconomic growth.
