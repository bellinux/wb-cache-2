5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Peter uses {{information}} left by {{his father}} to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains {{that he had to}} leave, because he refused to cooperate with Norman's biogenetic weaponization plans. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the British scholarship, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and, vowing to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> she goes, they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and overload Electro's body, killing him.|$|E
5|$|It was {{now that}} Philip applied {{the coup de}} grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks {{that he and his}} army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units {{straight}} to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms {{of the end of the}} Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> he wished. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.|$|E

5|$|Sun is at a party, and {{is served}} {{champagne}} by a waiter, Jin. They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they are seeing each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E

That is their supreme importance in the history of mankind. In the great utterances of Isaiah the prophetic voice rises to a pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadows the whole earth united and at peace under one God.

Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 96, a myth {{explaining}} Skíðblaðnirs {{creation is}} provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once {{cut off the}} goddess's Sif's hair {{in an act of}} mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and Skíðblaðnir, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} first {{shown at the}} E3 event in May 2004, when a playable demo was made {{available}} for all three consoles. The demo featured gameplay from Moria, and included a fight against two trolls and the battle against the Balrog, {{as well as some}} footage from the film. EA announced the game would be about five times as long as the Return of the King game. They also explained that although the game would be linear, and the player would not be free to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> they wished in Middle-earth, at most times during the game, optional sidequests would be available. The game would be divided into smaller chapters comprising three main story arcs; the journey from Rivendell through Moria to Lothlórien; the journey across Rohan to Helm's Deep, and the subsequent Battle of the Hornburg; and the journey from Helm's Deep to Minas Tirith, and the subsequent Battle of the Pelennor Fields. EA explained players would be given already developed characters, but customization and attributes would not be tied to character classes, so players would be free to have any character specialize in any mode of combat they wished. Each of the characters in the game was based upon a minor character or extra who appeared {{at some point in the}} films, and who was named by the production crew but never named on-screen.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} behind the demise of Mongolic was the {{religion}} of Islam. The Persian language became so much part of the religion of Islam that it almost <b>went</b> <b>wherever</b> Islam took roots. Persian entered, in this way, into the very faith and thought of the people embracing Islam throughout South Asia.|$|R

500|$|The {{situation}} was now grave for the defenders {{and they decided}} to send two of their most prominent citizens to Philip as negotiators. Appearing before Philip, these men offered to surrender the city to him on the conditions that the Rhodian and the Pergamese garrisons were allowed to leave the city under a truce and that all the citizens were permitted to leave the city with the clothes they were wearing and <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> they pleased, in effect meaning an unconditional surrender. Philip replied that they should [...] "surrender at discretion or fight like men." [...] The ambassadors, powerless to do more, carried this response back to the city.' ...|$|E
500|$|The Stoic ethic espouses a {{deterministic}} perspective; {{in regard}} to those who lack Stoic virtue, Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is [...] "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> it goes." [...] A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, {{in the words of}} Epictetus, [...] "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy," [...] thus positing a [...] "completely autonomous" [...] individual will, {{and at the same time}} a universe that is [...] "a rigidly deterministic single whole". [...] This viewpoint was later described as [...] "Classical Pantheism" [...] (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza).|$|E
500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that they saw me pee." ...|$|E

500|$|Weingartner said he {{received}} an offer large enough that [...] "I {{would not have to}} work {{for the rest of my}} life" [...] from an American studio but refused it, opting to produce the film with his own studio, y3film, and coop99, an Austrian studio. A low-budget film, it was funded by a €250,000 loan Weingartner obtained with his parents' house as collateral. His second feature film, The Edukators was shot with hand-held digital cameras, allowing the director [...] "to explore the space and give actors license to <b>go</b> <b>wherever</b> they wanted." [...] Weingartner wanted a technically simple film focused on the actors. His decision to have a low budget was measured: [...] "More money means more pressure. This way, I used a limited crew and was able to set the shooting schedule the way I wanted it - usually. The huge advantage of this kind of film-making is that it's rapid." [...] Most of the film was shot in Berlin, except for scenes in the Austrian Alps.|$|E

2500|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the recent [...] rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycle.

Riders unknown to each other commonly greet each other when on bikes. As in many subcultures, this feeling of belonging is a key factor in recruiting and retaining participants.|$|E
2500|$|General Terry {{and others}} claimed that Custer made {{strategic}} errors {{from the start}} of the campaign. For instance, he refused to use a battery of Gatling guns, and turned down General Terry's offer of an additional battalion of the 2nd Cavalry. Custer believed that the Gatling guns would impede his march up the Rosebud and hamper his mobility. His rapid march en route to the Little Bighorn averaged nearly [...] a day, so his assessment appears to have been accurate.
