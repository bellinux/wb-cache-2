40|$|Abstract—An {{inherent}} characteristic of most translinear (TL) filters is instantaneous companding. This brief describes a distortionless syllabic companding TL filter {{based on the}} “analog floating-point technique” [1]. Through {{the addition of a}} compensation current to each of the capacitances in the <b>filter,</b> <b>distortion</b> is eliminated. By applying syllabic companding to a TL filter, the input current can be much larger than the quiescent current, thus increasing the dynamic range.

A second order filter design procedure is outlined to facilitate the realisation of Butterworth and Chebyshev functions. The proposed filter was built and tested with NXP pin diode model BAP 65 - 03. The measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured insertion loss in the ON state was 3. 0 dB the isolation in the OFF state was 45 dB at the centre frequency.

This correspondence presents {{an investigation of the}} effects of notch filters on the performance of PN correlation receivers. A theoretical analysis of the correlation drop due to <b>filter</b> <b>distortion</b> has been conducted and confirmed by experimentation. Additional measurements and analysis have established the trade-off between correlation drop and interference suppression as a function of interference bandwidth. A typical result is that by incurring a penalty of a 1 -dB drop in correlation peak, interfering signals having bandwidths of 2 to 3 % of the PN chip rate can be attenuated by 25 dB...|$|E

40|$|The most {{advanced}} metrics for performance evaluation of image denoising algorithms {{are based on}} the classification of filtered pixels in two crisp classes: pixels where residual noise is still present (due to insufficient filtering) and pixels where excessive <b>filtering</b> has produced <b>distortion.</b> However, the intrinsic nature of image denoising is very likely to be fuzzy: a pixel can be affected by different degrees of unfiltered noise and <b>filtering</b> <b>distortion</b> as well. According to this idea, a new method for performance measurement of grayscale image denoising filter is presented. The method adopts a fuzzy model-based procedure that estimates, for each filtered pixel, the different components of the filtering error, i. e., the amounts of unfiltered noise and <b>filtering</b> <b>distortion</b> produced by the denoising process. Computer simulations dealing with different test images corrupted by various amounts of noise show that the new approach performs significantly better than state-of-the art metrics in the field. Furthermore, the results yielded by the proposed method are in perfect agreement with the true values of residual noise and image blur that can be theoretically evaluated for an important class of denoising filters...|$|R
40|$|Convolutive blind source {{separation}} (BSS) usually encounters two difficulties – {{the filter}} indeterminacy in the recovered sources {{and the relatively}} high computational load. In this paper we propose an efficient method to convolutive BSS, by dealing with these two issues. It consists of two stages, namely, multichannel blind deconvolution (MBD) and learning the postfilters with the minimum <b>filter</b> <b>distortion</b> (MFD) principle. We present a computationally efficient approach to MBD in the first stage: a vector autoregression (VAR) model is first fitted to the data, admitting a closed-form solution and giving temporally independent errors; traditional independent component analysis (ICA) is then applied to these errors to produce the MBD results. In the second stage, the least linear reconstruction error (LLRE) constraint of the separation system, which was previously used to regularize the solutions to nonlinear ICA, enforces a MF...|$|E

Binary {{antipodal}} direct-sequence biphase modulation {{is employed}} (for {{the purpose of}} interference reduction) over a channel disturbed by white noise and an "external" coherent sinusoidal interference. Before these are added, the signal suffers distortion {{in the form of}} linear filtering whose effects are to be determined. The receiver is a coherent "rematched filter" (matched to the distorted signal). The mean and variance of the detection variable are expressed as an output SNR (signal to noise ratio). The variance is the sum of three components: due to noise, external interference, and self interference. Concise formulas for the first two contributions are developed. The third is approximated and found to be quite small in many cases of interest. Results are applied in the case in which the filter has a bandpass characteristic and external interference is dominant. With fixed signal power entering the filter, there is an optimal chip rate above which <b>filter</b> <b>distortion</b> effects increase faster than process gain; the optimal chip rate is approximately equal to the filter noise bandwidth B (Hertz). For an ideal bandpass filter and a single pole bandpass filter, the optimal chip rates are 1. 0 B and 0. 95 B, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe single-channel {{conductance}} varies significantly {{between different}} {{members of the}} inward rectifier (Kir) family of potassium channels. Mutations at three sites in Kir 6. 2 {{have been shown to}} produce channels with reduced single-channel conductance, the largest reduction (to 40 % of wild-type) being for V 127 T. We have used homology modeling (based on a KcsA template) combined with molecular dynamics simulations in a phosphatidycholine bilayer to explore whether changes in structural dynamics of the filter were induced by three such mutations: V 127 T, M 137 C, and G 135 F. Overall, 12 simulations of Kir 6. 2 models, corresponding to a total simulation time of 27 ns, have been performed. In these simulations we focused on distortions of the selectivity filter, and on the presence/absence of water molecules lying behind the filter, which form interactions with the filter and the remainder of the protein. Relative to the wild-type simulation, the V 127 T mutant showed significant distortion of the filter such that ∼ 50 % of the simulation time was spent in a closed conformation. While in this conformation, translocation of K+ ions between sites S 1 and S 2 was blocked. The distorted filter conformation resembles that of the bacterial channel KcsA when crystallized {{in the presence of a}} low [K+]. This suggests <b>filter</b> <b>distortion</b> may be a possible general model for determining the conductance of K channels...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{within this}} thesis concerns the {{monitoring of the}} fetus during labour, using the fetal electrocardiogram (FECG). A versatile FECG analysis system was developed for the Microsoft Windows environment, to allow various FECG parameters to be extracted. Algorithms, currently used in other FECG analysis systems, were implemented using Object Oriented Programming, thus allowing new algorithms to be easily added at a later stage. Although these current algorithms have been demonstrated by several authors, {{it was felt that}} they had been used with only partial investigation of their limitations, and with failure to fully determine their accuracy in controlled conditions. These factors are fully addressed within this thesis. By developing a FECG simulator, in which heart-rate, morphology, and noise levels could be varied, the ability of the analysis algorithms to extract the parameters, and the accuracy of these parameters under different noise conditions, were thoroughly checked. Both ability and accuracy were shown to be very good in ideal noiseless conditions; but, with the addition of noise, there exists a compromise between parameter accuracy when the morphology is static, and parameter accuracy when the morphology is changing. The accuracies of the most common indices in this field (the Conduction Index, and the T/QRS ratio) were determined for different levels of simulated noise, and their values demonstrated for data previously recorded from the fetal scalp. Errors as large as 0. 3 in the CI and 0. 05 in the T/QRS suggested that in the clinical environment, an indication of the accuracy of each index ought to be displayed, and this may be estimated from the measured level of noise. Furthermore, this analysis system allows the direct comparison of both indices. Finally, in order to design a more effective front-end filter, {{it is important to be}} aware of the frequency content of the underlying FECG. The Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation (IPFM) model, combined with Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), was used to estimate realistic frequency components within the FECG signal. The effects of filtering could then easily be modelled to show the distortion of both the FECG and any parameters taken from it. For a FECG frontend <b>filter,</b> <b>distortion</b> was found to be insignificant provided that, above 1 Hz, both the gain remained constant and there was no phase-distortion...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for the high quality TV {{programs}} such as High Definition TV (HDTV). The CATV network is often a suitable solution to address this demand using a CATV modem delivering high data rate digital signals in a cost effective manner, thereby, utilizing a complex digital modulation scheme is inevitable. Exploiting complex modulation schemes, entails a more sophisticated modulator and distribution system with much tighter tolerances. However, there are always distortions introduced to the modulated signal in the modulator degrading signal quality. In this research, the effect of distortions introduced by the RF band pass filter in the modulator will be considered which cause degradations {{on the quality of}} the output Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) signal. Since the RF <b>filter's</b> amplitude/group delay <b>distortions</b> are not symmetrical in the frequency domain, once translated into the base band they have a complex effect on the QAM signal. Using Matlab, the degradation effects of these distortions on the QAM signal such as Bit Error Rate (BER) is investigated. In order to compensate for the effects of the RF <b>filter</b> <b>distortions,</b> two different methods are proposed. In the first method, a complex base band compensation filter is placed after the pulse shaping filter (SRRC). The coefficients of this complex filter are determined using an optimization algorithm developed during this research. The second approach, uses a pre-equalizer in the form of a Feed Forward FIR structure placed before the pulse shaping filter (SRRC). The coefficients of this pre-equalizer are determined using the equalization algorithm employed in a test receiver, with its tap weights generating the inverse response of the RF filter. The compensation of RF <b>filter</b> <b>distortions</b> in base band, in turn, improves the QAM signal parameters such as Modulation Error Ratio (MER). Finally, the MER of the modulated QAM signal before and after the base band compensation is compared between the two methods, showing a significant enhancement in the RF modulator performance...|$|R
