6000|$|That {{composition}} {{had to wait}} awhile, in {{the earliest}} time, to find its proper centre, having been from the <b>free</b> <b>point</b> of view I thus cultivate a little encumbered {{by the presence of}} the most aged of our relatives, the oldest person I remember to have familiarly known--if it can be called familiar to have stood off in fear of such strange proofs of accomplished time: our Great-aunt Wyckoff, our maternal grandmother's elder sister, I infer, and an image of living antiquity, as I figure her to-day, that I was never to see surpassed. I invest her in this vision with all the idol-quality that may accrue to the venerable--solidly seated or even throned, hooded and draped and tucked-in, with big protective protrusive ears to her chair which helped it to the effect of a shrine, and a large face in which the odd blackness of eyebrow and of a couple of other touches suggested the conventional marks of a painted image. She signified her wants as divinities do, for I recover from her presence neither sound nor stir, remembering of her only that, as described by her companions, the pious ministrants, she had [...] "said" [...] so and so when she hadn't spoken at all. Was she really, as she seemed, so tremendously old, so old that her daughter, our mother's cousin Helen and ours, would have had to come to her in middle life to account for it, or did antiquity at that time set in earlier and was surrender of appearance and dress, matching the intrinsic decay, only more complacent, more submissive and, as who should say, more abject? I have my choice of these suppositions, each in its way of so lively an interest that I scarce know which to prefer, though inclining perhaps a little to the idea of the backward reach. If Aunt Wyckoff was, as I first remember her, scarce more than seventy, say, the thought fills me with one sort of joy, the joy of our modern, our so generally greater and nobler effect of duration: who wouldn't more subtly strive for that effect and, intelligently so striving, reach it better, than such non-questioners of fate?--the moral of whose case is surely that if they gave up too soon and too softly we wiser witnesses can reverse the process and fight the whole ground. But I apologise to the heavy shade in question if she had really drained her conceivable cup, and for that matter rather like to suppose it, so rich and strange is the pleasure of finding the past--the Past above all--answered for to one's own touch, this being our only way to be sure of it. It was the Past that one touched in her, the American past of a preponderant unthinkable queerness; and great would seem the fortune of helping on the continuity at some other far end.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>free</b> <b>point</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} the delineating point between the stuck pipe and the free pipe in a pipe string. Every joint of pipe above the <b>free</b> <b>point</b> is free, meaning it can rotate freely and be moved {{in and out of the}} hole, provided it was not attached to the remaining joints of stuck pipe below the <b>free</b> <b>point.</b> A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left hand. With your right hand grab the bottom third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your right hand would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your right hand is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your right hand.|$|E

30|$|The third task, {{defining}} the concentration allocation {{for the main}} experiment, is guided by an idea of robustness similar to the second task. From a formal point of view, only as many concentration points as unknown parameters in the dose-response model are needed. It would however be unwise to involve only this minimum because it would not allow model checks. Concentration allocation needs at least a vague idea about position and scale of the concentration-response curve. Concentration-finding experiments, pilot studies, literature data, and similar sources are used to obtain these planning assumptions. Given an initial assumption, we propose the following concentration allocation strategy: calculate EC 10, EC 50, EC 90 from the planning assumptions, assuming a logistic concentration-response relation and involving SL and IY, if the selected risk type requires so. The control concentration of zero and these three concentrations plus target concentrations, given by the ECxx values of the experimenter’s interest, constitute the concentration allocation pattern for the main experiment. Two-sided CIs with 95 and 99  % coverage probability will be calculated for the concentration-response curve. If more than four concentration points are chosen {{and there is an}} even number of <b>free</b> <b>points,</b> these will be allocated symmetrically around the chosen ECxx value. If two <b>free</b> <b>points</b> are available, these are located at the limits of the 95  % CI. If an even number of 4 or more <b>free</b> <b>points</b> is available, these are allocated equidistantly in the 99  % CI. For an odd number of <b>free</b> <b>points,</b> 1 point is located at ECxx and the others are allocated according to the rule for an even number. Note that the 1 of EC 10, EC 50, EC 90 can be used twice as an experimental concentration, if the user’s target coincides with one of these. The strategy prefers low concentrations if several targets are specified by the user. This pattern is a robust strategy which focuses on the main interest of finding ECxx but does not rely too strongly on the planning assumptions. If previous experience suggests that the planning assumptions are realistic, concentrations could be allocated more closely around the presumed ECxx.|$|R

5000|$|Once the <b>free</b> <b>point</b> of a {{stuck pipe}} string is determined, the stringshot {{back-off}} service {{can be used}} to remove the free portion from the well. The string-shot is a metal rod wrapped in explosive primer cord. The back-off procedure applies left-hand torque to the stuck pipe string. The CCL is used to help position the string shot at the predetermined pipe joint, and then the string shot is detonated. [...] The explosion produces a similar effect as an intense hammer blow and allows the joint to be unscrewed at the proper connection. Several factors such as pipe size, weight and condition, back-off depth, mud or borehole fluid weight and well temperature are carefully considered when making up the proper string-shot assembly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} freepoint tool is an electromechanical tool {{designed to}} measure the amount of torque or stretch of a given length of tubing, drill pipe, or casing. The traditional freepoint tool uses either bow springs or magnets to anchor itself inside the pipe. After obtaining {{an estimate of the}} <b>free</b> <b>point</b> by using the pipe stretch estimate technique, the traditional freepoint tool is run in the hole to 1000 feet above the estimated stuck point. The tool is anchored in place. Stretch and or torque is then applied to the pipe. This allows the pipe recovery engineer to obtain a baseline reading of the free pipe. This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled uphole and readings are taken again. By applying the bracketing technique, the pipe recovery engineer is quickly able to identify the exact point that the pipe is free.|$|E
