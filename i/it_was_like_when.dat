500|$|Konnan {{was still}} working in Mexico while under {{contract}} to WWF, and was also simultaneously appearing in a Mexican telenovela aimed at children called [...] "El abuelo y yo". As he was becoming more popular in Mexico, he was not as focused on making it in America. Konnan recollected, [...] "Wrestling was so hot in Mexico, because they had lifted this 30-year ban on wrestling on TV in Mexico City. I was able to capitalize on that wrestling boom. I was wrestling three times in one day on many weekends. The amount of work was incredible. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> Raw and Nitro were going head-to-head and there was work for everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> {{are we going to}} have to start acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best to take care of the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. [...] Now let’s play breaking up.' That will be different." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
5000|$|Thirty-five of his waka were {{included}} in the imperial anthologies of waka including Kokin Wakashū. In the preface Ki no Tsurayuki criticized him: [...] "he knows how to construct waka, but there is less real emotion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> you see a picture of a woman and it moves your heart". Henjō was famous for the following poem from the Hyakunin Isshu: ...|$|R

[...] "Moklan is thy son and mine, {{wherefore}} he is brave. Mayhap, because of thy very brave father, Moklan <b>is</b> too brave. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> too much water is put in the pot it spills over. So too much bravery is put into Moklan, and the bravery spills over.|$|R
40|$|Ricorditi lettor" Vision, Imagination, Memory The opening {{lines of}} the 17 th Canto of "Purgatory", at the exact centre of "The Divine Comedy", ask the reader to {{remember}} what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> the sun disperses a mountain fog, so as to understand Dante's vision.

6000|$|... "But sir, {{one of the}} cruisers {{that was}} there got up close to it, and a buddy of mine says this ship acted funny.

60|$|I {{had thought}} as much, from his white face {{and from the}} way in which he let his men lounge upon their horses. It was not so long, however, since I had learned myself what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> a schoolboy has to give orders to veteran troopers. It made me blush, I remember, to shout abrupt {{commands}} to men who had seen more battles than I had years, and it would have come more natural for me to say, 'With your permission, we shall now wheel into line,' or, 'If you think it best, we shall trot.' I did not think the less of the lad, therefore, when I observed that his men were somewhat out of hand, but I gave them a glance which stiffened them in their saddles.|$|E

50|$|Using {{weighted}} backpacks is a {{very common}} form of weight. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> clothing <b>when</b> properly affixed, although some backpacks require tension in the pectorals or being held on the arms to keep from sliding off if not properly affixed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Imagine what it {{was like}} to see a bullet-shredded old battle-flag [...] reverently {{unfolded}} to the gaze of a thousand middle-aged soldiers, [...] most of whom hadn't seen it since they saw it advancing over [...] victorious fields, when they were in their prime.

6000|$|... "It is terrible," [...] Chris said to Sankey, who {{was riding}} next to him. [...] "I {{could not have}} {{imagined}} anything so dreadful as their appearance. I did not realize what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when,</b> {{two or three months}} before I left Johannesburg, I read in Motley's book about the war in the Netherlands of the state of things in Leyden when the Prince of Orange burst his way through to their rescue, and of the terrible appearance of the starved inhabitants, but now I can quite understand how awfully bad it was. It must have been even worse then. Here there were some rations distributed--little enough, but some. There the people had nothing but the weeds they gathered, and boiled down with the scraps they could pick up. There they died in hundreds of actual starvation; it cannot have been quite so bad here. But as we see, though there has been just enough food to keep life together, that has been all, and it has been from disease brought on by famine, and not by famine itself, that they have died. Then, too, shells were always falling among them, and at any moment they might be attacked. I expect that anxiety and fever have had {{as much to do with}} it as hunger." ...|$|E
6000|$|The episode {{with the}} showman {{reminds me of}} a dark chapter in my history. I once robbed an aged and blind beggar-woman of four dollars--in a church. It {{happened}} this way. When I was out with the Innocents Abroad, the ship stopped in the Russian port of Odessa and I went ashore, with others, to view the town. I got separated from the rest, and wandered about alone, until late in the afternoon, when I entered a Greek church to see what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> I was ready to leave, I observed two wrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall, near the door, with their brown palms open to receive alms. I contributed to the nearer one, and passed out. I had gone fifty yards, perhaps, when {{it occurred to me that}} I must remain ashore all night, as I had heard that the ship's business would carry her away at four o'clock and keep her away until morning. It was a little after four now. I had come ashore with only two pieces of money, both about the same size, but differing largely in value--one was a French gold piece worth four dollars, the other a Turkish coin worth two cents and a half. With a sudden and horrified misgiving, I put my hand in my pocket, now, and sure enough, I fetched out that Turkish penny! ...|$|E

50|$|The knew-it-all-along {{effect is}} {{a variant of the}} {{hindsight}} bias. It is the tendency for people to misremember and think that they knew more in the past than they actually did. In such situations it is difficult for us to remember what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> we did not have an understanding of something. For example, one might have a hard time teaching a concept to another individual because they can not remember {{what it is like to}} not understand the material.|$|E
5000|$|Talking to Ian Curtis is ... or was {{a strange}} {{experience}} because he's very warm ... he talked—it was like two people inside of him—he talked very light, and he talked very well-mannered, and very polite. But when he got behind the microphone he really surged forth; there was another energy. It seemed like he was just two people and, you know, [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> that record was released ... it was like, as if, there were the personalities, separate; there they were, torn apart.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{played the}} {{supporting}} role of President Alma Coin, {{the leader of}} a rebellion against The Capitol, in the third installment of the lucrative Hunger Games film series, [...] The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final appearance of 2014 {{was one of the most}} acclaimed of her career. In the drama Still Alice, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer's Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was [...] "extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence", while according to Kenneth Turan she was [...] "especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> your mind empties out." [...] Several critics commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG and BAFTA for Best Actress.|$|R

50|$|The castle {{eventually}} {{fell into}} disrepair and vanished from Gifu's skyline. However, it was rebuilt in 1956 {{and that is}} the castle that still stands today. During reconstruction, tiles were carried to the top by volunteers. Those who helped were able to write messages on the roof tiles before they were put in place. Those who helped were able to experience what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> the castle was originally built many years before. From the top of the castle, visitors have a 360-degree view, effectively giving them a view to all the borders of the city of Gifu. Inside the castle are many artifacts from its past.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is based}} upon the early life of the author whose Jewish father, noted drama critic, {{journalist}} and screenwriter Alfred Kerr, was wanted by the Nazis.

She came to write the book when her own son was eight; after seeing The Sound of Music he remarked, [...] "now we know what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> Mummy was a little girl". Kerr wanted him to know what it was really like and so wrote When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit.
