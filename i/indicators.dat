30|$|<b>Indicator</b> {{reliability}} specifies {{how much}} of an <b>indicator’s</b> variance {{can be explained by the}} underlying latent variable. It is demanded that more than 50  % of an <b>indicator’s</b> variance is explained by the latent construct. Its value is the square of the item loading [50]. That means that, for item loadings of the latent constructs on an <b>indicator</b> variable, square of the <b>indicator</b> loading larger than 0.7 is acceptable [50, 51]. Other authors suggest that an <b>indicator</b> loading of 0.4 is acceptable [50] what equals a square of the <b>indicator</b> loading of 0.64. <b>Indicator</b> loadings less than 0.4 should be eliminated from measurement models [56]. In our study, the <b>indicator</b> loadings ranged between 0.68 and 0.97; in other words, the lowest <b>indicator’s</b> explained variance was just below 0.5 but above 0.4. This <b>indicator</b> was therefore not deleted. This implies that we find support for <b>indicator</b> reliability.|$|R
