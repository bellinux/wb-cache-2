50|$|Because the {{prosecution}} must prove guilt beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>a</b> defendant asserting actual innocence need only raise <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{as to whether}} they were the person who committed a particular crime, or whether the acts that they committed amount to the commission of a crime. In point of fact, the defendant is not obliged to present a defense at all.|$|R

50|$|In {{answer to}} these questions, {{the court held}} that it was not {{satisfied}} that the State had passed the first hurdle: It had failed to prove, beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt,</b> that Arnold’s conduct was voluntary. Even if it had, though, the court was not satisfied that the State had proved beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> that Arnold had criminal capacity at the relevant time.

500|$|Erroneous {{denial of}} <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{instruction}} is <b>a</b> structural error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal. Erroneous definitions of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{do not require}} reversal as long as [...] "taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> to the jury." [...] Instructions on certain evidentiary presumptions against the defendant, if interpreted as conclusive presumptions or as shifting {{the burden of proof}} to the defendant, are also unconstitutional; permissive presumptions are constitutional. In some circumstances, a trial court must separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence, in addition to giving <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> instruction.|$|R

5000|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{has since}} {{emphasized}} in R. v.

[...] It is not enough to believe that the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty. Proof of probable guilt, or likely guilt, is not proof beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|R
