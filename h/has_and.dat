5|$|The Commission <b>has,</b> <b>and</b> {{continues}} to, {{also provide}} support for war graves outside its traditional mandate. In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities for them. Since 2005, the Commission has carried out similar management duties {{on behalf of the}} British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War. In 2003, Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility. As of 2011, the Commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans' markers installed {{at the expense of the}} Government of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain {{creatures are}} natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found {{at odds with}} one another. Common {{behaviours}} when a creature is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player <b>has</b> <b>and</b> how large they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when 'Payday' comes, will head for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, 'scavenging' (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include lightning bolts, rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as a creature takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player {{has the ability to}} possess a creature, seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.|$|E

5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players {{have the freedom to}} choose how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a locked door. In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as stealing a specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or stealing a certain amount of loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character <b>has,</b> <b>and</b> changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a key objective or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save.|$|E
5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley of ashes on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she <b>has,</b> <b>and</b> sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each control point has 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level.

40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not. In To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, <b>and</b> the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not are reduced to roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading has been done on Hemingway’s novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, <b>and</b> his portrayal of five female characters in the novel has been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory has been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not were found to correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R
