5000|$|The {{painting}} was first exhibited in Schutz's fall 2016 solo exhibition, [...] "Waiting for the Barbarians," [...] at Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin. In February 2017, Open Casket {{was one of}} three of Schutz's paintings selected for inclusion in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Describing the painting in a New Yorker profile on Schutz, critic Calvin Tomkins wrote, [...] "Measuring thirty-nine by fifty-three inches, it is smaller than most of her recent paintings, and more abstract. The buildup of paint on the face is a couple of inches thick in the area where Till’s mouth would be. Although there are no recognizable features, a deep trough carved into the heavy impasto conveys a sense of savage disfigurement, which is heightened by the whiteness of the boy’s smoothly <b>ironed</b> <b>dress</b> shirt. His head rests on an ochre-yellow fabric, and deftly brushed colors at the top suggest banked flowers." ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{landscape}} is a {{main source of}} interpretation in mining archaeology. Activities related to mining and ore dressing have left a lot of marks in the landscape. They reveal the evidence of structures no longer visible; {{that is the case}} of dry rivers which cannot explain the large volumes of sediment treated in <b>iron</b> ore <b>dressing</b> workshops. Field investigation and underground exploration have been carried out over some three decades and have {{led to the development of}} geomorphological and survey methods for analysing mining and ore dressing landscapes. This methodology has been used to study alterite <b>iron</b> ore <b>dressing</b> activities and remains in the Jura Mountains and its margins: the Saône Valley. Geomorphological knowledge is necessary to compare and to identify the differences between natural and anthropic features. In many cases, ore dressing landscapes reveal morphological structures of ablation and accumulation; their volume, amplitude and profiles can vary within a territory and according to the whole process. The study of these landmarks and waste deposits involves different approaches; all of them refer to a morphogenetic process whose sedimentary content is the key element to interpret such evidences...|$|R

50|$|At dinner, {{several things}} go wrong, Bradshaw impacts a couple {{breakaway}} chairs. The second one causes {{a jar of}} termites to fall and crawl all over Mr. Bradshaw clothes and he bolts to the kitchen. Angry, Andy tosses the termite spray {{on the other side}} of the room, causing it to melt the floor. He discovers that he used the table to spray for termites, which just collapses. Enraged, Andy walks towards the kitchen but falls through the floor and to the downstairs apartment, spooking and fainting a lady <b>ironing</b> her <b>dress.</b> Bewildered, Andy looks around for help. Her jealous husband, in the middle of his daily shave, hears the crash and chases Andy out of the apartment. Soon after, Claude and Bradshaw accidentally fall down to the same apartment and both get beaten to a pulp by the jealous husband. When they re-enter Andy's apartment, Bradshaw angrily informs him to get rid of Claude or Andy is fired, Andy jumps at the chance and orders Claude and Mrs. Beasley out of the apartment. Before they leave, Claude tells Andy he invented a new gasoline and tried it out on his mother's car. It soon explodes and Mrs. Beasley physically scolds Claude form off-screen.|$|R
5000|$|While Timmins {{has stated}} that it took her ten years to get {{comfortable}} singing {{in front of an}} audience to this day, She suffers from stage fright and has a ritual she performs prior to each show. Timmins says, [...] "I do two things. One is, I <b>iron</b> my <b>dress</b> and I post the set list on the wall and stare at it to get a sense of the flow of the songs. After that, I arrange my flowers. I always have flowers on stage. Once they're arranged, I hand them to my crew guy to put on stage and that's the cue that we're about to start. Arranging my flowers is my meditation. I focus on the flowers and think about nothing. I have no problems being on the stage nowadays. But it's still difficult for me to get from the side of the stage to the microphone. Just that initial walking out is hard. I have my tea. I always bring my tea out with me because I think it's an anchor, it's something to carry, something to do with my hands. I stand on the side of the stage drinking my tea before I go out. That's my nervous time. I go out, I say hi, and we go into a song. Within that song, I calm down, catch my breath and relax. Then it's like, Yeah, I like it up here. I forgot how much I like it up here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Generally {{people in}} Chhattisgarh, {{especially}} Bastar people have excellent skills in variety of craft work including Dhokra, bamboo craft, wrought <b>iron</b> craft, tribal <b>dress,</b> traditional textile, Kantha embroidery, terracotta, tribal painting, bell metal, etc. Their skills {{have been recognized}} by national and state awards. Badhai people are skilled in this woodcraft work and they are divided into two groups. One group make agricultural instruments and other group make decorative and totemic pillars. Another community, knows as Muria people also has woodcarving skills. The Murias are best in craftsmanship. Their skill apply in various objects that from small to big. They turn craft skills into interpretation of basic lifestyles and basic routines of life such as chaffing of paddy, grinding grains, etc. They do not forget to express culture and religious faiths into craft art that reflect through gods, goddess, music culture {{of the community and}} wildlife. The craft work heavily depended as hand-made where there is no machinery usage or rare use in particular areas only.|$|R
40|$|Studies of Iron Age {{artefacts}} from Britain tend to {{be dominated}} either by the study of metalwork, or pottery. This thesis presents a study not only of a different material, but also {{a different type of}} object: glass beads. These are found in a range of different sizes, shapes, colours, and employ a variety of different decorative motifs. Thus far, glass beads have been studied through typology (Guido 1978 a) and compositional analysis (Bertini 2012; Henderson 1982), yet a thorough analysis of the social context of glass beads remains absent. Through an analysis of glass beads from four key study regions in Britain, this thesis aims not only to address regional differences in appearance and chronology, but also to explore the role that this object played within the networks and relationships that constructed Iron Age society. It seeks to understand how they were used during their lives and how they came to be deposited within the archaeological record, in order to establish the social processes that glass beads were bound within. The results indicate that glass beads were a strongly regionalised artefact, potentially reflecting differing local preferences for colour and motif. In addition, glass beads, in combination with several other types of object, were integral to Middle <b>Iron</b> Age <b>dress.</b> Given that the first century BC is often seen as a turning point in terms of settlements and material culture, this supports the possibility of strong continental exchange during an earlier period for either glass beads or raw materials. However, by the Late Iron Age in the first century BC and early first century AD, their use had severely diminished...|$|R
40|$|Iron sand mined from Mukaihama {{beach in}} the city of Akita was applied to make "Tamahagane" based on {{combined}} use of the "Tatara-buki" and "Oroshigane" process. The Tamahagane was applied to make a small knife based on hot forging process. Initially, the iron sand was washed in water and dressed magnetically to rise iron content of the sand. After that, the iron sand was smelted by means of the "Tatara-buki" process to produce Tamahagane with lower phosphorous and sulfur contents. The Tamahagane was obtained in a 10. 4 % yield which was lower than that of 26 % in usual process. The reason was considered to be due to high concentration of SiO_ 2 in the <b>dressed</b> <b>iron</b> sand. The Tamahagane showed a mixed structure of ferrite and pearlite. Finally, the Tamahagane was forged at about 1100 K to make a small knife which was about 3 mm in thickness and 80 mm in length. It was available to use as a fruit knife, though the microstructure was macroscopically non uniform...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years of}} {{continuous}} {{research and development}} {{have led to a}} major improvement in the field of iron ore Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation - WHIMS. With this cutting-edge technology, Gaustec has established a new world record in this class of Magnetic Separators, by providing a sheer feed rate of up to 1400 tph for iron ore fines. Although low-grade iron ore mines will benefit from this new technology, focused on herein is the reclaiming of low-grade iron ore tailing from ponds, having in mind its huge positive environment impact and business opportunity. Based on this newly developed technology, the construction in Brazil of a Concentration Plant started in 2012 for <b>dressing</b> <b>iron</b> ore tailings at 45 % Fe grade, at Itaminas Mine. This plant went into operation this year. Based on the good performance of this first unit, the construction of a second Concentration Plant of the same type, to further reduce to 18 % Fe in the tailings, is under way, scheduled to be started-up in 2014...|$|R
50|$|Parish's most {{well-known}} character, Amelia Bedelia, is extremely literal minded and interprets idioms and other verbal expressions literally, which amusingly causes great havoc in each story. This idea originated in conversations between Parish and Greenwillow Books founder Susan Hirschman about the author's observations of her third grade students. Amelia {{works as a}} household cook and occasional servant, jobs that Parish did in her home when she was young. She uses no recipes, but, by intuitively combining {{a little bit of}} this and a little bit of that, her cakes and cookies and meals are always delicious. She is such a good cook that her employers cannot fire her, despite the disastrous way she misinterprets their instructions: prune the shrubs, scale and ice the fish, file the letters, run over the tablecloth with an <b>iron,</b> shorten these <b>dresses,</b> serve coffee with porridge, heat a can of soup, and so on. The author's word-play, and Amelia Bedelia's fundamental goodness and childlike simplicity appeal to youngsters who are beginning to see and enjoy more than one meaning in a word or a phrase.|$|R
5000|$|Merlin {{appeared}} in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode [...] "Day of the Dark Knight" [...] voiced by David McCallum. He is a wizard who is a companion of King Arthur, the boss of Etrigan, and the teacher of Morgaine le Fey. When Morgaine le Fay was taking over Camelot and took control over Etrigan, he traveled to the present and brought Batman and Green Arrow to medieval times after they thwarted a break-out attempt at <b>Iron</b> Heights while <b>dressed</b> as an inmate. He hopes {{to use them to}} retrieve Excalibur to help defeat Morgaine. When they reached the location, he engaged Morgaine le Fay in a magic battle. When Batman broke free from Morgaine le Fay's spell, she turned into a dragon and turned Merlin and Etrigan to stone. Following Morgaine le Fey's defeat, Camelot was freed and Batman and Green Arrow were returned to the present by Merlin. In [...] "Trials of the Demon," [...] it was mentioned that he and Etrigan imprisoned Astaroth in the Underworld. In [...] "The Siege of Starro" [...] Pt. 1, the teaser shows Morgaine le Fay having trapped Merlin until he is freed by Etrigan the Demon.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the common}} {{soldiers}} were bandits who took up service for a campaign and then reverted to banditry when the campaign was over. One politician remarked that when the warlords went to war with each other, the bandits become soldiers and when the war ended, the soldiers became bandits. Warlord armies commonly raped or took many women into sexual slavery. The system of looting was institutionalized, as many warlords lacked {{the money to pay}} their troops. Some took to kidnapping, and might send a hostage's severed fingers along with the ransom demand as a way of encouraging prompt payment. To defend themselves from the attacks of the warlord armies, peasant secret societies emerged that practiced martial arts. The Red Spear Society performed secret ceremonies to confer invulnerability from bullets to channel the power of Qi and went into battle naked with supposedly bulletproof red clay smeared over their bodies. The all-female <b>Iron</b> Gate Society <b>dressed</b> entirely in white (the color of death in China) and waved fans that they believed would deflect bullets. One bandit leader, Bai Lang, the [...] "White Wolf," [...] declared himself loyal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen and formed a [...] "Citizen's Punitive Army" [...] to rid China of all the warlords.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a miserable}} world," [...] says the Sergeant. [...] "Human life, Mr. Betteredge, {{is a sort}} of target--misfortune is always firing at it, and always hitting the mark. But for that outfit, we should have {{discovered}} a new nightgown or petticoat among Rosanna's things, and have nailed her in that way. You're not at a loss to follow me, are you? You have examined the servants yourself, and you know what discoveries two of them made outside Rosanna's door. Surely you know what the girl was about yesterday, after she was taken ill? You can't guess? Oh dear me, it's as plain as that strip of light there, {{at the end of the}} trees. At eleven, on Thursday morning, Superintendent Seegrave (who is a mass of human infirmity) points out to all the women servants the smear on the door. Rosanna has her own reasons for suspecting her own things; she takes the first opportunity of getting to her room, finds the paint-stain on her night-gown, or petticoat, or what not, shams ill and slips away to the town, gets the materials for making a new petticoat or nightgown, makes it alone in her room on the Thursday night lights a fire (not to destroy it; two of her fellow-servants are prying outside her door, and she knows better than to make a smell of burning, and to have a lot of tinder to get rid of)--lights a fire, I say, to dry and <b>iron</b> the substitute <b>dress</b> after wringing it out, keeps the stained dress hidden (probably ON her), and is at this moment occupied in making away with it, in some convenient place, on that lonely bit of beach ahead of us. I have traced her this evening to your fishing village, and to one particular cottage, which we may possibly have to visit, before we go back. She stopped in the cottage for some time, and she came out with (as I believe) something hidden under her cloak. A cloak (on a woman's back) is an emblem of charity--it covers a multitude of sins. I saw her set off northwards along the coast, after leaving the cottage. Is your sea-shore here considered a fine specimen of marine landscape, Mr. Betteredge?" ...|$|R
