The simulated E-plane pattern at 15 GHz showed radiation towards the backfire direction in the <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern,</b> clearly indicating the excitation of a backward wave. Since the transverse dimension of the array is electrically short, the structure is backed by a long metallic trough. The trough acts as a waveguide below cut-off and recovers the back radiation, resulting in unidirectional far-field patterns.|$|E

Effective mode volume is proportional to the breadth of the relative distribution of power amongst the modes in a multimode fiber. It is not truly a spatial volume but rather an [...] "optical volume" [...] equal to the product of area and solid angle. The power divided by the {{effective mode volume}} is proportional to the radiance of the light emitted by the fiber.|$|E

40|$|Both offset and {{symmetric}} Cassegrain reflector antennas {{are used}} in satellite and ground communication systems. It is known that the subreflector diffraction can degrade the performance of these reflectors. A geometrical theory of diffraction/physical optics analysis technique is used to investigate {{the effects of the}} extended subreflector, beyond its optical rim, on the reflector efficiency and <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns.</b> Representative numerical results are shown for an offset Cassegrain reflector antenna with different feed illumination tapers and subreflector extensions. It is observed that for subreflector extensions as small as one wavelength, noticeable improvements in the overall efficiencies can be expected.

50|$|Note that, by the {{principle}} of reciprocity, the pattern observed when a particular antenna is transmitting {{is identical to the}} pattern measured when the same antenna is used for reception. Typically one finds simple relations describing the antenna <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns,</b> often involving trigonometric functions or at worst Fourier or Hankel transform relationships between the antenna current distributions and the observed <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns.</b> While <b>far-field</b> simplifications are very useful in engineering calculations, this does not mean the near-field functions cannot be calculated, especially using modern computer techniques. An examination of how the near fields form about an antenna structure can give great insight into the operations of such devices.|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} methods {{to reduce the}} noise power in the <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> of an antenna as measured in cylindrical near-field (CNF) are proposed. Both methods {{are based on the}} same principle: the data recorded in the CNF measurement, assumed to be corrupted by white Gaussian and space-stationary noise, are transformed into a new domain where it is possible to filter out a portion of noise. Those filtered data are then used to calculate a <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> with less noise power than that one obtained from the measured data without applying any filtering. Statistical analyses are carried out to deduce the expressions of the signal-to-noise ratio improvement achieved with each method. Although the idea of the two alternatives is the same, there are important differences between them. The first one applies a modal filtering, requires an oversampling and improves the <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> in all directions. The second method employs a spatial filtering on the antenna plane, does not require oversampling and the <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> is only improved in the forward hemisphere. Several examples are presented using both simulated and measured near-field data to verify the effectiveness of the methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the electromagnetic wave scattering phenomena by quasi-homogeneous obstacles, namely obstacles with wavenumber functions not exhibiting large variations {{from an average}} value k. First, we express the field coefficients {{by means of a}} T-matrix method for the corresponding piecewise-homogeneous scatterer and then perform the best linear approximation by dif-ferentials to express these coefficients as linear combinations of the distances of the wavenumber samples from k. Moreover, the total <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> of the quasi-homogeneous scatterer is decomposed into that of the respective homogeneous scatterer with wavenumber k plus the perturbation <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern,</b> depending exclusively on the wavenumber’s deviations from k. Numerical results are pre-sented concerning (i) the far-field patterns, computed by the proposed technique and the T-matrix method, (ii) the variations of the perturbation <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern,</b> and (iii) the prediction of each layer’s contribution to the far-field...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies using {{theoretical}} predictions, numerical solutions, and measured data for analysing the radiation patterns of Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) antennas in free-space and over lossless and low-loss half-spaces. These studies demonstrated that theoretical <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> do not apply in the near-field, and that results from simplistic models do not well match measured data from real antennas. In this paper a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model based on a high-frequency commercial GPR antenna was used to conduct an initial study into the near- and <b>far-field</b> radiation <b>patterns</b> in different environments. The antenna model replicates all the detailed geometry and main components of the real antenna. Taguchi's optimisation method was used when developing the antenna model to determine values for any unknown parameters (due to commercial sensitivity). E-and H-plane patterns from the antenna model were analysed and compared with theoretical <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> over a range of different lossless half-spaces (εr = 3, 6, 12), and at a range of distances (0. 1 - 0. 6 m). It was found that the modelled E- and H-plane patterns converged towards a consistent shape between 0. 1 - 0. 2 m indicating a transition between field zones occurring at this range. Significant differences in the shape and amplitude of the modelled and theoretical patterns were observed. This indicates that the complexity of GPR antennas means that theoretical <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> cannot be assumed for the environments typically encountered by high-frequency GPR antennas...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the modulus of the <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> (or {{phaseless}} <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern)</b> is invariant under translations of the scattering obstacle if only one plane wave is used as the incident field, so the shape but not the location of the obstacle can be recovered from the phaseless far-field data. In this paper, it is proved that the translation invariance property of the phaseless <b>far-field</b> <b>pattern</b> can be broken if superpositions of two plane waves are used as the incident fields for all wave numbers in a finite interval. Based on this, a recursive Newton-type iteration algorithm in frequencies is then developed to recover both the location and the shape of the obstacle simultaneously from multi-frequency phaseless far-field data. Numerical examples are also carried out to illustrate the validity of the approach and the effectiveness of the inversion algorithm.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, spontaneously {{emerging}} {{patterns in the}} density of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities {{were found to be}} a promising candidate for all-optical switching. But recent approaches were mostly restricted to scalar fields, did not benefit from the polariton's unique spin-dependent properties, and utilized switching based on hexagon <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> with 60 beam switching (i. e. in the far field the beam propagation direction is switched by 60). Since hexagon <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> are challenging, we present here an approach for a linearly polarized spinor field, that allows for a transistor-like (e. g., crucial for cascadability) orthogonal beam switching, i. e. in the far field the beam is switched by 90.

40|$|Abstract-A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for the accuracy qualification of near-field antenna measurement ranges. The methodology presented {{is a combination}} of analysis, computer simulation, component certification, self-tests, and comparison tests. The analysis uses closed-form equations to establish upper bound far-field determination errors due to near-field measurements errors. Computer simulation is used to model the specific near-field measurement errors associated with the near-field measurement system components. The closed-form equations and computer simulation are used to form a near-field error budget for each of the near-field measurement system components. A near-field system component certification is undertaken to measure the near-field measurement system component errors and establish that they are within the error budget. Repeated near-field measurement self-tests are performed with a stable antenna under test, changing one measurement system condition for each test. These tests reveal changes in assumed invariant conditions. Finally, a comparison test is performed using a stable antenna under test in which <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> determined from the near-field range undergoing qualification are compared to the <b>far-field</b> <b>patterns</b> determined on another range with known accuracy.
