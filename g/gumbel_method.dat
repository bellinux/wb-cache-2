40|$|This work compares and {{predicts the}} {{response}} of roof edge components to wind load. The edge components consist of three different parapet coping configurations {{on the edge of}} a commercial building's roof system. Full-scale highly non-Gaussian data acquired on a low-rise building is used for analysis. The comparison shows that strong suction is observed on the front flashing of all configurations, contrarily to what is specified in building codes. The prediction of the edge component response to wind load is accomplished with both a Gumbel distribution model and a translation method recently proposed in the literature, which estimate the extreme value distribution of the pressure coefficient. A Gumbel model is commonly used to represent the distribution of the peak pressure coefficient. The model parameters are determined from observed peaks, defining the <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method.</b> Recent work has proposed an alternative, the translation method, using the pressure coefficient entire time history instead, modeled as a translation from a Gaussian random process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{empirical}} formula to estimate design rainfall intensity based on intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves. These curves have been generated from a 32 -year recorded rainfall data for Riyadh region. Rainfall intensity–duration–frequency curves describe rainfall intensity as a function of duration for a given return period which are important for the design of storm water drainage systems and hydraulic structures. The formula is derived using the analysis of results of three different frequency methods, namely: Gumbel, Log Pearson III, and Log normal. These methods are used to obtain the IDF curves for six different durations (10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 24 h) and six frequency periods (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 years) where the best method of IDF estimation is recommended for future analysis. The equation can predict rainfall intensity in Riyadh region for any return period with a given storm duration and calibrated parameters obtained from IDF curves. Good match was achieved between its results and other analytical methods results such as <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method.</b> Moreover, it allows incorporating data from non-recording stations, thus remedying the problem of establishing IDF curves in places with a sparse network of rain-recording stations...|$|E

40|$|When {{assessing}} maps {{consisting of}} comparable regional values, {{it is of}} interest {{to know whether the}} peak, or maximum value, is higher than it would likely be by chance alone. Peaks on maps of crime or disease might be attributable to random fluctuation, or they might be due to an important deviation from the baseline process that produces the regional values. This paper addresses the situation where a series of such maps are observed over time, and it is of interest to detect statistically significant deviations between the observed and expected peaks as quickly as possible. The Gumbel distribution is used {{as a model for the}} statistical distribution of extreme values; this distribution does not require the underlying distributions of regional values to be either normal, known, or identical. Cumulative sum surveillance methods are used to monitor these Gumbel variates, and these methods are also extended for use when monitoring smoothed regional values (where the quantity monitored is a weighted sum of values in the immediate geographical neighborhood).

The period of continuous records ranged from 4 – 37 years. The maximum monthly hourly mean and the maxima annual hourly mean wind speed data were analysed using the Gumbel and Gringorten methods. Both methods gave close results in determining basic wind speeds, with the <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method</b> giving slightly higher values. Due to a lack of long-term records in some regions of Oman, basic wind speeds were extrapolated for some stations with only short-term records, which were defined as those with only 4 – 8 years of continuous records; in these cases, monthly maxima were used to predict the long-term basic wind speeds. Accordingly, a basic wind speed map was developed for a 50 -year return period. This map was based on basic wind speeds calculated from actual annual maxima records of 29 stations with at least 9 continuous years of records as well as predicted annual maxima wind speeds for 11 short-term record stations.

Consideration of wind loads is very important in the structural design especially in the design of high rise structures. This, among accurate prediction of other loads affecting a structure, ensures safe and economic design of structures. Kenyan structural engineers depend on basic wind speeds which were determined over 30 years ago. It is important to periodically review the wind speeds. This is because the wind speeds experienced could change due to changes in land use like deforestation to give way for infrastructure among other causes. Most structures are usually designed for a life period of 50 yrs, thus the basic wind speed will have a return period of 50 years.

Another automatic segmentation method using a trimmed likelihood estimator (TLE) was implemented for comparison with our proposed segmentation framework. The performances of the three automatic segmentation methods were evaluated by comparing with the manual segmentation method. ResultsThe Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of the two EVD-based segmentation methods were larger than those of the TLE-based segmentation <b>method</b> (<b>Gumbel,</b> 0. 823 [*]±[*] 0. 063; Fréchet, 0. 843 [*]±[*] 0. 057; TLE, 0. 817 [*]±[*] 0. 068), demonstrating that the EVD-based segmentation outperformed the TLE-based segmentation. The Fréchet segmentation obtained larger DSCs on patients with moderate to severe lesion loads and a comparable performance on patients with mild lesion loads, indicating that the Fréchet segmentation was superior to the Gumbel segmentation. The Gumbel segmentation underestimated the lesion volumes of all patients, whereas the Fréchet and TLE-based segmentation methods obtained overestimated lesion volumes (Manual, 13. 71 [*]±[*] 14. 02 cc; Gumbel, 12. 73 [*]±[*] 13. 21 cc; Fréchet, 13. 88 [*]±[*] 13. 96 cc; TLE, 13. 54 [*]±[*] 12. 27 cc).

The increasing of temperature has led to increase of evaporation rate, rainfall intensity, sea water level and so forth. These changes will lead to greater disaster such as increase of flood magnitude, flood event, drought intensity and prolong the drought period. The main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the monthly rainfall pattern from 1984 to 1993 for the Teluk Intan Basin. Five stations of rainfall data were retrieved from DID. The rainfall distribution pattern was calculated by using two types of probability distributions known as Log-Pearson type-III and <b>Gumbel</b> using California’s <b>method.</b> Later, Chi-square test of goodness of fit was applied to validate the results. Based on the calculated results, out of the five stations used in this study, only three stations shows are fitted to apply the mentioned method which is Mengkuang River St, Labu Kubong St and Telok Intan station. Maximum total rainfall for ten years period occurs at Pt. IV Sg. Manik St as the value is 5570. 5 mm, meanwhile minimum total rainfall occurs at Pt. I Sg. Manik St as the value is 1462. 5 mm.

40|$|Recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico (e. g., Ivan, Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Ike) were {{observed}} to develop wave conditions that were near or exceeded the predicted 100 -year conditions. As a result, many offshore facilities, {{as well as}} coastal infrastructure, which were designed to withstand the 100 -year condition, were damaged. New estimates of extreme conditions, which incorporate recently observed maxima, are needed to provide better guidelines for design of coastal and offshore structures. Berek et al. (2007) have used modeled data to develop new criteria, but these estimates can be very sensitive to the data and to the statistical methods used in the development. Berek's estimates also do not cover the entire Gulf of Mexico. We have developed updated estimates of the 100 -year extreme wave conditions for the entire Gulf of Mexico using a more comprehensive approach. First, the applicability of standard parametric wind models was examined and appropriate adjustments to the Rankine vortex model were developed to reduce the wind field errors during hurricane conditions. The adjusted winds reduced the error by up to 25 percent compared to the original Rankine vortex model. To obtain reliable wave data, merged wind fields were generated using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project modeled wind data for background wind and the parametric wind model for hurricane conditions.

The locations used are Oslo, Heimsjø, Honningsvåg, Narvik, Harstad, Tregde, Andenes and Viker, and four different methods {{have been used for}} the estimation. We use two established and widely used methods, the Annual Maxima Method (AMM) and the Peaks-over-Threshold (POT) method. The AMM uses the observed annual maxima from each location, while the POT method uses the exceedances of some high threshold in relation to the data. In addition, we also use two approaches that are less known and less used, the Revised Joint Probability Method (RJPM) and the Average Conditional Exceedance Rate (ACER) method. In the former, a distribution for extreme surges is found and used together with information from numerical tide predictions. We also take into account the interaction between tides and surges where applicable. The ACER method uses only the series of measured sea levels, but tries to account for dependence by a cascade of conditioning probabilities. We find that for return periods up to 20 years the return levels are usually very similar for all methods except RJPM, which seems to underestimate these values. The data intensive methods of POT, RJPM and ACER seem to agree for the 200 year levels, while particularly the <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method</b> seems to overshoot the levels in comparison to the other methods...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology for the quantitative assessment of design sea levels for southern Africa. In order to achieve this objective it was necessary to establish which ocean processes affected sea level in the sub-continent and develop a probabilistic model for the combination thereof. The methodology, is used to characterize regional design sea levels in terms of the west, south and east coasts. A site specific application is undertaken to demonstrate the model's capabilities with regard to the design of depth limited structures. The ultimate objective {{of this study is to}} provide a practical approach to the quantification of the sea level component of loading in the full probabilistic design assessment. Data analysis considers all available sea level and wave data for three ports around the coast. A three parameter threshold analysis technique is used to define independent identically distributed events. The distinction between the major processes affecting sea levels in southern Africa may be related to the differences in both the time and space scales of their response to the forcing mechanisms. The data analysis procedure is used to defined the primary statistical characteristics of the observed events in each data set as they relate to sea level. A stochastic simulation model is developed which reproduces a synthetic hourly sea level record displaying the same statistical characteristics as the observed data. Annual maximum values are extracted from the model output with a view to estimating extreme sea levels. The model may be run over any number of periods until satisfactory convergence in the results is obtained. The theoretical basis of the model is described and the results compared with the <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method.</b> A regional assessment of design sea levels for southern Africa indicated that the south coast experienced larger fluctuations in the stochastic component of sea level than the east and west coasts. Sea levels throughout the sub continent are primarily affected by tide, shelf waves, wind waves and edge waves. These processes were found to be statistically independent of one another for the areas evaluated. Design sea level would appear to be determined by a combination of a number of moderate magnitude events rather than one single process. The application of the model illustrates the importance of considering both wave height and sea level conditions as stochastic variables for the design of depth limited structures. The relative influence of stochastic sea level is shown to increase from deep to shallow water...|$|E

Alberto Tomasin Estimation {{of return}} periods for extreme sea levels: a {{simplified}} empirical correction {{of the joint}} probabilities method with examples from the French Atlantic coast and three ports in the southwest of the UK Accepted: 8 November 2006 # Springer-Verlag 2007 Abstract The joint probability method (JPM) to estimate the probability of extreme sea levels (Pugh and Vassie, Extreme sea-levels from tide and surge probability. Proc. 16 th Coastal Engineering Conference, 1978, Hamburg, American Society of Civil Engineers, New York, pp 911 – 930, 1979) {{has been applied to}} the hourly records of 13 tide-gauge stations of the tidally dominated Atlantic coast of France (including Brest, since 1860) and to three stations in the southwest of the UK (including Newlyn, since 1916). The cumulative total length of the available records (more than 426 years) is variable from 1 to 130 years when individual stations are considered. It appears that heights estimated with the JPM are almost systematically greater than the extreme heights recorded. Statistical analysis shows that this could be due: (1) to surge–tide interaction (that may tend to damp surge values that occur {{at the time of the}} highest tide levels), and (2) to the fact that major surges often occur in seasonal periods that may not correspond to those of extreme astronomical tides. We have determined at each station empirical ad hoc correction coefficients that take into account the above two factors separately, or together, and estimated return periods for extreme water levels also at stations where only short records are available. For seven long records, for which estimations with other computing methods (e. g. generalized extreme value [GEV] distribution and Gumbel) can be attempted, average estimations of extreme values appear slightly overestimated in relation to the actual maximum records by the uncorrected JPM (+ 16. 7 ± 7. 2 cm), and by the <b>Gumbel</b> <b>method</b> alone (+ 10. 3 ± 6. 3 cm), but appear closer to the reality with the GEV distribution (− 2. 0 ± 5. 3 cm) and with the best-fitting correction to the JPM (+ 2. 9 ± 4. 4 cm). Because the GEV analysis can hardly be extended to short records, it is proposed to apply at each station, especially for short records, the JPM and the sitedependent ad hoc technique of correction that is able to give the closest estimation to the maximum height actually recorded. Extreme levels with estimated return times of 10, 50 and 100 years, respectively, are finally proposed at all stations. Because astronomical tide and surges have been computed (or corrected) in relation to the yearly mean sea level, possible changes in the relative sea level of the past, or foreseeable in the future, can be considered separately and easily added to (or deduced from) the extremes obtained. Changes in climate, on the other hand, may modify surge and tide distribution and hence return times of extreme sea levels, and should be considered separately. Keywords Tide gauge. Sea level.

UK 1 Introduction Most methods usually employed to estimate return periods of extreme values for hydrological or meteorological datasets (extremes per block, threshold method, annual maxima [Gumbel] method) are based on a number of assumptions: (1) that we deal with statistical variates; (2) that the initial distribution from which the extremes have been drawn, and its parameters, remains constant from one Responsible editor: Roger Proctor Parts of this paper have been presented orally at the session “Geophysical extremes: scaling aspects and modern statistical approaches” of the EGU General Assembly, Vienna, 2 – 6 April 2006.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{analyses of}} survival data involve {{the assumption that}} survival and censoring are independent. When censoring and survival are related, the phenomenon is known as informative censoring. This paper examines the effects of an informative censoring assumption on the hazard function and the estimated hazard ratio provided by the Cox model. ^ The limiting factor in all analyses of informative censoring {{is the problem of}} non-identifiability. Non-identifiability implies {{that it is impossible to}} distinguish a situation in which censoring and death are independent from one in which there is dependence. However, it is possible that informative censoring occurs. Examination of the literature indicates how others have approached the problem and covers the relevant theoretical background. ^ Three models are examined in detail. The first model uses conditionally independent marginal hazards to obtain the unconditional survival function and hazards. The second model is based on the <b>Gumbel</b> Type A <b>method</b> for combining independent marginal distributions into bivariate distributions using a dependency parameter. Finally, a formulation based on a compartmental model is presented and its results described. For the latter two approaches, the resulting hazard is used in the Cox model in a simulation study. ^ The unconditional survival distribution formed from the first model involves dependency, but the crude hazard resulting from this unconditional distribution is identical to the marginal hazard, and inferences based on the hazard are valid. The hazard ratios formed from two distributions following the Gumbel Type A model are biased by a factor dependent on the amount of censoring in the two populations and the strength of the dependency of death and censoring in the two populations. The Cox model estimates this biased hazard ratio. In general, the hazard resulting from the compartmental model is not constant, even if the individual marginal hazards are constant, unless censoring is non-informative. The hazard ratio tends to a specific limit. ^ Methods of evaluating situations in which informative censoring is present are described, and the relative utility of the three models examined is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Kuantan {{is one of}} {{the flood}} prone areas that {{identified}} in Pahang. The main river basin is Kuantan River. This basin is responsible to drain water from the correspond catchment area to the South China Sea. Due to heavy local rainfall is often occur in the Kuantan area, Kuantan River as main river basin is cannot longer support the volume of the rainfall will causing the flood to the areas surrounding. It is getting worse year by year with heavy rainfall especially at low level area cause of clog drain, design failing, wrong estimation and other natural causes. Besides, the rainfall data in MSMA 2 has not been updated by JPS and it is not reliable {{to be used as a}} reference for any hydraulic design. In MSMA 2, only one station which is Sg. Lembing P. C. C. L Mill represent Kuantan district and its intensity parameter will be used for the development project along the Kuantan River Basin. That way may affect the value of intensity should be used for that location area. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve for all 10 station along the Kuantan River Basin based on historical data. Also, to analyse the appropriate frequency analysis in developing IDF curve for Kuantan River Basin and also to compare the rainfall intensity values between MSMA and appropriate frequency analysis for IDF curves. The rainfall data that required for construction of IDF curve is from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID). The data period of 5 minutes to 7200 minutes starting on year 1971 to year 2015. To designing IDF curve, process involved are find the value of mean, standard deviation, frequency factor, rainfall depth and intensity value for 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 years return period for both <b>methods</b> <b>Gumbel</b> and Log-Pearson Type III. The range percent of difference intensity between MSMA and new IDF curve is (0. 0493 %- 98. 1556 %). It is cause by the location of new station either far away or near with the station Sg. Lembing P. C. C. L Mill. Gumbel and Log-Pearson Type III method is used to compare whether it is appropriate to be used for construction of IDF curve for Kuantan River Basin. So, in order to test the accuracy of both methods, Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) was be used for fitting distribution. Based on the result, mostly Log-Pearson Type III test which is 0 / 120 test was rejected while Gumbel Distribution showed to fit the graph than Log-Pearson Type III by that accept 120 / 120 test. So, Gumbel is accepted 100 % from all test in Gumbel that can be acceptable compared to LPT III...|$|R
40|$|Khartoum State in Sudan {{is subject}} to the erratic and intense {{rainfall}} during the short rainy season and dryness and heat {{throughout the rest of the}} year. High intensity rainstorms with a short duration have become more frequent in the area during the last two decades resulting in cities inundation and flash floods in the rural parts. On the other hand, the dry season means hot weather in the urban parts and water shortage in the rural part. Rural areas are dependent on the runoff water brought about by the seasonal streams as a source of water. For this study, Khartoum City Center and Seleit area were taken to investigate the application of water harvesting in the urban and rural areas, respectively. Accordingly, the hydrological characteristics and the specification of the potential water harvesting sites and systems were examined. For Khartoum City Center, characteristics of the drainage system were examined using ArcGIS platform. It is found that the drainage system covers 42 % of the area with total capacity of 24000 m 3. Daily rainfall data for urban meteorological station were used to calculate the probability and the return period of the rainfall, as well as the potential runoff. Rainfall probability of occurrence was calculated applying <b>Gumbel</b> distribution <b>method</b> for extreme events that were arranged according to the Peak-over-Threshold method. The potential runoff that could be generated from a certain rainfall was calculated using the Natural Resources Conservation Services method provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (US-NRCS). Accordingly, the curve number was calculated depending on the land use/land cover and the hydrological soil group. Consequently, the weighted curve number is found to be 94 %, indicating dominant imperviousness. 13. 1 mm rainfall depth produces runoff volume equal to the drainage system capacity with return period of one year; whereas more than four folds the drainage system capacity is produced by 30 mm rainfall depth that is considered the threshold for raising flood hazard. Six potential sites for roof rainwater harvesting were selected. Accordingly, it is found that, the application of roof water harvesting in 18 % and 72 % of the commercial and business district buildings can accommodate the runoff resulting from the 13. 1 and 30 mm rainfall depth, respectively. Hence, impounding rainstorm water would help managing the urban runoff water, and consequently, the stored water could be used for making more green areas that will enhance the urban environment. Three watersheds of ephemeral streams (wadi), namely Wadi El Kangar, Wadi El Seleit, and Wadi El Kabbashi make up Seleit area. Distinct maps were prepared in ArcMap for the calculation of the potential runoff and the specification of the appropriate water harvesting sites and systems. The Wadis watersheds areas are found to be 540, 344 and 42 km 2 for Wadi El Kangar, Wadi El Seleit and Wadi El Kabbashi, respectively. Daily rainfall data of rural meteorological station were classified into three groups representing the soil dry (AMCI), moderate (AMCII), and wet (AMCIII) moisture conditions; the respective CNI, CNII, and CNIII values were calculated accordingly. The weighted CN values indicate high runoff potential within the three soil moisture conditions. Accordingly, the rainfall thresholds for runoff generation for AMCI, AMCII and AMCIII conditions are found to be respectively 18. 3 mm, 9. 1 mm and 4. 4 mm for Wadi El Kabbashi and 22 mm, 11 mm and 5 mm for both Wadi El Seleit and Wadi El Kangar. El Kangar dam subwatershed was used for calibrating the potential runoff calculated by the NRCS method. Since the Wadis are ungauged, Google Earth and GIS platforms were used to calculate geometrically the volume of the dam reservoir water for three years. This volume was compared to the annual runoff calculated by the NRCS method. Consideration to different factors was made to locate the potential water harvesting sites. Accordingly, water harvesting systems for fodder and crop plantation; sand storage surface or subsurface dams; or groundwater recharge, were specified. The socio-economic study revealed that the financial capacity, if any, of the villagers is very limited. Thus, the financial source for the construction of the suggested potential water harvesting or the rehabilitation of the existing ones is questionable. Hence, other potential financial sources are needed to help executing water harvesting projects in the region, e. g. Khartoum State Government. Applying water harvesting in Seleit area is found to be promising. Improving the livelihood of the villagers by applying runoff water harvesting could assure better water accessibility, better income generation from farms production, and allocation of time for other activities, e. g. education. This would be reflected in reduced migration to nearby cities and stabilized market supply of agricultural and animal products. Therefore, the development of the rural part is of great benefit to the development of Khartoum State, as long as the interdependency and mutual benefit between the rural and urban areas, represented by the local food and labor market, remain exist...|$|R
40|$|As {{climate change}} topics get heated and more related {{researches}} have been undertaken, the facts {{have been observed}} and revealed {{that more and more}} natural disasters and extremelitie are influencing people s way of life dramatically, for instance the flood. Floods have always been problems in most countries in the world, this paper firstly gives a glance of the methodologies applied in Norway and China traditionally and modernly in dimensioning floods. A comparison of the traditional methods and modern one (rainfall-runoff model) have been carried out. A case in Guala Catchment along Goula River which brings the most catastrophic floods in Norway historically has been studied. Literature review gives some ideas on how this river behaves and actually inside this catchment, most of the area are protected, to be specific along some parts of the river, there are some drinking water conservations or natural conservations have been protected, which makes the river less regulated compared to most of the Norwegian rivers for power production. This might be one of the reasons discussed in the paper regarding possible reasons of the catastrophic floods formation. A distributed hydrological model is set up and implemented for the catchment in order to simulate runoff generation where four discharge gauging stations exist. Daily resolution data has been collected on precipitation, air temperature, runoff, relative humidity, wind speed and global radiation so that the ENKI framework containing different sub-routines (models) can be operated. Setup, calibration and validation have been finished by ENKI and a set of best-performed parameters are obtained and listed in the paper. The criteria based on Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency R 2 is used to terminate the calibration process, Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency is testified and widely used, {{but this is not the}} only criteria to use, since the purpose of the work is to analyze flood, and based on the fact that the annual peak value (AMS) for each year would be picked to proceed with the frequency analysis, the performance of the model in catching the peaks is more important and meaningful than the overall performance in this sense. In addition, manual calibration is taken as well to hit the peaks, finally is it found that PcorrRain, PcorrSnow, TX, k 2, k 1, k 0 have strong correlations with the flood generation. R 2 of 0. 6 have obtained and compared in calibration period. R 2 of 0. 42 have been obtained in the validation period. It seems that there are still big improvements in model calibration due to the time limitation, since the data which has been fixed manually and the ones interpolated by the model must be different, and for such distributed model, data is of crucial importance. So this can be further tested to check which one behaves better. This has been discussed in the conclusion part. Tradition <b>method</b> <b>Gumbel</b> Distribution in dimensioning flood has been applied in the analysis both to the whole catchment and also two upstream part of the catchment with different sizes. The comparison between the analysis of observed runoff series and simulated runoff series is carried out. As for the recent frequent floods happened in Gaula Catchments, one potential topic can also be the relationship between climate change, human activities and floods in such a catchment with an area of 3000 km 2...|$|R
