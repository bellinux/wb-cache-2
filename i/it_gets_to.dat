The A21 then heads through northern Hastings where the road is known as Sedlescombe road North with access to sub-urban streets until eventually it meets the A2101 which heads for the Town Centre. The A21 then enters Silverhill where <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> a junction which is sometimes a major bottleneck. Afterwards the A2102 heads for St Leonards and the A21 becomes the high street of Bohemia where the road is narrow. The route then heads down with access to various emergency services and then enters the town centre. From here the original A21 cut through the town centre to meet the A259 at a roundabout near Pelham Crescent however since the town centre has been pedestrianised the A21 heads down on the sub-urban streets to the east. The next section of the A21 heads around partly on a one-way system near the railway station and the Priory Quarter business development. From here, the southbound stretch of A21 is reserved for buses only and terminates on the A259.|$|E

500|$|Threes had no {{original}} inclination towards minimalism. In fact, Vollmer and Wohlwend {{felt that}} the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players.

500|$|When {{returning}} to the fundamental and original game concept—pairing tiles as multiples of three—the developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions. The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version, as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired. For example, the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it [...] "tough and frustrating and sometimes hard {{to see if it}} was worth it".

'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever." [...] James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, [...] "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited {{about him in the}} first place.
