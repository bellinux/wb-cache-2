5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted <b>Knapweed</b> (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted <b>knapweed</b> and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|Current park {{managers}} {{focus on}} controlling nine high-priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds: yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis); spotted <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea maculosa); Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus); bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare); velvet grass (Holcus lanatus); cheat grass (Bromus tectorum); French broom (Genista monspessulana); Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus); and perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium). In 2008, the park {{began to use}} the herbicides glyphosate and aminopyralid to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} diffuse <b>knapweed’s</b> success {{relies on the}} effect of its {{allelopathic}} chemicals in its novel environment. [...] Although there is still debate concerning the effectiveness of allelopathic chemicals in the field, the evidence of allelopathic effects demonstrated in a laboratory setting and its propensity to establish monocultures support the importance of allelopathy to diffuse <b>knapweed’s</b> success.|$|R
50|$|Some {{fruit flies}} {{are used as}} agents of {{biological}} control, thereby reducing the populations of pest species. Several species of the genus Urophora are used as control agents against rangeland-destroying noxious weeds such as starthistles and <b>knapweeds,</b> but their effectiveness is questionable. Urophora sirunaseva produces larvae that pupate within a woody gall within the flower and disrupt seed production. Chaetorellia acrolophi is an effective biocontrol agent against <b>knapweeds</b> Chaetorellia australis and Chaetorellia succinea, deposit eggs into the starthistle seedheads, where their larvae consume the seeds and flower ovaries.|$|R
25|$|Adults feed {{primarily}} on nectar of Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), <b>Knapweeds</b> (Centaurea spp.), Dandelion (Taraxacum), Fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), Marjoram (Origanum vulgare), Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and Vetches (Vicia spp.).|$|R
5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted <b>knapweed,</b> yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common <b>Knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted <b>knapweed,</b> leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Bracken, plantains, sorrel, <b>knapweeds,</b> {{rhododendron}} and cranberries are {{amongst the}} plants that favour acidic conditions, while alkaline conditions tend to support populations of perennial sow thistle, bladder campion, and henbane.|$|R
50|$|Adults feed {{primarily}} on nectar of Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), <b>Knapweeds</b> (Centaurea spp.), Dandelion (Taraxacum), Fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), Marjoram (Origanum vulgare), Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and Vetches (Vicia spp.).|$|R
50|$|This site is an {{unimproved}} hay meadow, {{which has}} around eighty flower species, such as green-winged orchids, yellow rattles, musk mallows and black <b>knapweeds.</b> Other plants include adder's tongue ferns.|$|R
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed, meadow <b>knapweed,</b> giant hogweed, garlic mustard and purple loosestrife. The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater <b>knapweed,</b> harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted <b>knapweed</b> over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed on Centaurea (<b>knapweeds),</b> Plantago (plantain herb), Trifolium (clovers), Artemisia vulgaris (Common Wormwood) {{and even}} the marine eelgrass Zostera marina. Yet other unusual recorded foods are dry leaves, plant waste, and old roots.|$|R
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed on {{a variety}} of herbaceous plants, mainly dandelion (Taraxacum species), plantains (Plantago species), deadnettles (Lamium species), yarrow (Achillea species), blackberries (Rubus species), nettles (Urtica species), <b>knapweeds</b> (Centaurea species) and strawberries (Fragaria species).|$|R
50|$|Lixinae is a {{subfamily}} of true weevils, {{included in}} the Molytinae in many older treatments. They are mainly root feeders, although some develop in flower buds or stems. Several species are used in biological control of invasive weeds, namely <b>knapweeds</b> (Centaurea).|$|R
25|$|British Columbian {{introduced}} species include: common dandelion, ring-necked pheasant, Pacific oyster, brown trout, black slug, European starling, cowbird, <b>knapweed,</b> bullfrog, purple loosestrife, Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry, European earwig, tent caterpillar, sowbug, grey squirrel, Asian longhorn beetle, English ivy, fallow deer, thistle, gorse, Norway rat, crested mynah, and Asian or European gypsy moth.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July 2010 An Post {{introduced}} Stamps On A Roll. The stamps are on {{rolls of}} 600 and are only given a denomination {{at the time}} of purchase. To distinguish these stamps from other stamp products, they are being given the name Stamps On A Roll or SOAR for short. The stamps feature four of the designs from this series: bloody crane's-bill, mountain avens, spring gentian and common <b>knapweed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Five more {{designs were}} added on 12 April 2005, the 1c bloody crane's-bill, 2c Irish orchid, 7c fly orchid, 10c {{mountain}} avens and €10 spring gentian.

50|$|These true bugs maily feed on Apiaceae, {{especially}} on parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), field eryngo (Eryngium campestre) and Peucedanum species. This species can be found, however, on spurge (Euphorbia spec.) and <b>knapweeds</b> (Centaurea spec.). Adults {{can be seen}} in June and July.|$|R
50|$|The insect flies from mid-April {{until the}} end of May with a second {{generation}} in September in Italy. The habitat is open grasslands and flowery meadows. The larvae feed on various Centaurea <b>knapweeds.</b> The flowers of Centaurea also attract the nectar-feeding adults.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent and}} spatial {{patterns}} of genetic variation at allozyme markers were investigated {{within and between}} diploid and autotetraploid <b>knapweeds</b> (Centaurea jacea L. sensu late, Asteraceae) at contrasted geographic scales: (1) among populations sampled from a diploid-tetraploid contact zone in the northeastern part of the Belgian Ardennes, and (2) within mixed populations from that zone where diploids and tetraploids coexist. Our data were also compared with a published dataset by Sommer (1990) describing allozyme variation in separate diploid and tetraploid <b>knapweeds</b> populations collected throughout Europe. Genetic diversity was higher in tetraploids. In the Belgian Ardennes and within the mixed populations, both cytotypes had similar levels of spatial genetic structure, they were genetically differentiated, and their distributions of allele frequencies were not spatially correlated. In contrast, at the European scale, diploids and tetraploids did not show differentiated gene pools and presented {{a strong correlation between}} their patterns of spatial genetic variation. Numerical simulations showed that the striking difference in patterns observed at small and large geographic scales could be accounted for by a combination of (1) isolation by distance within cytotypes; and (2) partial reproductive barriers between cytotypes and/or recurrent formation of tetraploids. We suggest that this may explain the difficulty of the taxonomic treatment of <b>knapweeds</b> and of polyploid complexes in general. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire {{if they want to}} restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E
25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common <b>Knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common <b>Knapweed,</b> Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser <b>knapweed,</b> while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E
50|$|These {{butterflies}} hibernate, so {{they could}} be seen year round, but the active flying period extends from April to November, depending on location. Adults feed on nectar, mainly of thistles (Cirsium and Carduus species), but also on bramble (Rubus fruticosus), ivy (Hedera helix), <b>knapweeds</b> (Centaurea species), and privet (Ligustrum vulgare).|$|R
50|$|As namesake {{member of}} the {{subtribe}} Centaureinae of tribe Cynareae, the <b>knapweeds</b> are probably most closely related to genera such as Carthamus (distaff thistles), Cnicus (blessed thistle), Crupina (crupinas) or Notobasis (Syrian thistle), and somewhat less closely to most other thistles. The monotypic Cnicus seems in fact to properly belong in Centaurea.|$|R
50|$|In autumn {{and winter}} its diet {{is based on}} the seeds of {{deciduous}} trees such as birch and above all alder. They also visit cultivated areas and pasture where they join with other finches in eating the seeds of various Compositae such as thistles, dandelions, Artemisia, <b>knapweeds</b> and other herbaceous plants such as St. John's wort, meadowsweet and sorrel.|$|R

500|$|Boise National Forest is {{directed}} by the U.S. Forest Service to [...] "control the establishment, spread, or invasion of non-indigenous plant species in otherwise healthy native vegetative ecosystems." [...] The forest's plan addresses the need to control invasive plants, and management efforts include chemical, mechanical, and biological control methods. Invasive plants that are of particular concern in Boise National Forest include spotted <b>knapweed,</b> yellow star-thistle, rush skeletonweed, and leafy spurge, among others.|$|E
500|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted <b>knapweed,</b> Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{feed on the}} nectar of bramble, thistles, and <b>knapweeds,</b> {{and also}} on aphid honeydew. The silver-washed is a strong flier, and more mobile than other fritillaries, and, as such, can be seen gliding above the tree canopy at high speed. Its {{preferred}} habitat is thin, sunny, deciduous woodland, especially oaks, {{but it has been}} known to live in coniferous woodland.|$|R
5000|$|Tarragon the Dragon - A small, {{friendly}} fire-breathing dragon. He {{was very}} clumsy, perhaps {{on account of}} the fact that everything he breathed fire at disappeared. (Luckily he only ever destroyed inanimate objects such as Constable <b>Knapweed's</b> notebook.) Like the other animals he only ever spoke in his signature song, which he sang with a lisp. He hatched from an egg that fell from the top of a tarragon plant in the sky.|$|R
5000|$|On June 27, 2000, a {{range fire}} {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} native sagebrush and bunchgrass. Though the US Fish and Wildlife Service has attempted to re-introduce native flora, the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve is currently dominated by non-native species such as cheatgrass, <b>knapweeds,</b> and Russian thistle (tumbleweed) [...] which flourished after the 2000 fire. Other species such as spiny hopsage and Wyoming big sagebrush were decimated by the fire and in its aftermath.|$|R
