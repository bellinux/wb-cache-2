25|$|Margaret Bromley's date {{of birth}} is unknown, but as her sole {{marriage}} was in 1593 it was probably in the early 1570s. Margaret's family, if related to the Lowes of Enville, as seems likely, were a very junior branch of the family. They had recently become fairly substantial landed gentry with interests in several parts of Staffordshire and neighbouring Derbyshire. However, Michael Lowe's background lay in the urban ruling group in Lichfield, rather than the landed gentry, and his considerable wealth came from {{his career as a}} lawyer. Humphrey Lowe and Simon Biddulph or Biddle, Margaret Bromley’s grandfathers, both appear repeatedly in the lists of the town’s officials, particularly the bailiffs, as do her uncle and cousin, both also called Simon Biddulph. There is evidence that the small, close group of families that dominated Lichfield was strongly Protestant even during the Marian persecutions. Margaret’s grandmothers, Margaret Biddulph and Joan Lowe, are listed among the supporters of Joyce Lewis a Protestant martyr burnt at Lichfield in 1557. The Biddulphs, as much as the Lowes, acquired country properties close to their urban base, with substantial estates at Elmhurst Hall. and Hammerwich. Lichfield’s records refer to the elder Simon Biddulph always as a mercer, while the younger is described as a gentleman, reflecting the social ascent of these merchant families into the rural landed class. However, Michael Lowe seems to have wanted a country retreat close to Lichfield rather than an investment in agriculture. He took on only three of the farming tenants, with their tofts, cottages and orchards, and only 80 of the 300 acres of grazing. Prominent among what he leased were 100 acres of <b>flooded</b> <b>land</b> and fishing rights on the River Tame, suitable for sport and leisure pursuits.|$|E
2500|$|Disturbances such as {{congestion}} by dams {{or natural}} {{events such as}} shore flooding {{are not included in}} the RCC model. [...] Various researchers have since expanded the model to account for such irregularities. [...] For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of geomorphologic disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows. [...] The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected. [...] The flood pulse concept, developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding <b>flooded</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, {{superintendent}} of the Skagit Hydroelectric Project James Delmage Ross died, so Ruby Dam was renamed Ross Dam in his memory. In 1943 a consortium of contractors including Morrison-Knudsen, which had previously participated in construction of Hoover Dam, began new construction on the dam ultimately raising its height to [...] [...] Energy demands during World War II coincided with an energy shortage in Seattle, requiring that the dam be constructed quickly, but the dam did not generate any power until many {{years after the war}} ended. This third phase was finished in 1949, to [...] This height would cause the reservoir at full pool to extend slightly past the Washington-British Columbia border. The reservoir, however, did not fill past the national border until 1954. As compensation for the <b>flooded</b> <b>land,</b> which totals about , Seattle City Light paid the Province of British Columbia $250,000, as well as an annual payment of $5,000. Two years prior to the reservoir reaching full pool, construction of the Ross Dam power plant began, and two turbines first went on line in 1956, generating 360MW of power. Another two generators were added later, increasing the capacity to its current 460MW.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The rate of {{chromosome}} aberrations {{has been}} studied in higher aquatic plants: common reed, sagittaria, flowering rush and manna. The main water bodies were Glubokoye and Dalekoye- 1 Lakes (left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River), Azbuchin Lake and Yanovsky Crawl (right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River), Cooling Pond of the Chernobyl NPP as well as Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. In decreasing sequence due to the absorbed dose rate for hydrobionts the first were water bodies of the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River, the second ones from right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands.</b> The highest chromosome aberrations rate in root meristems was registered in plants from lakes within the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River, the lowest one – in plants from the Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. The chromosome aberration rate in closed and slow-running water bodies within the right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River was in 3 – 4 times higher than spontaneous mutagenesis level. It seems that spectrum of the main types of chromosome damages in plants of right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> determines by chemical mutagens. The type of chromosome damages distribution in plants of the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> points to practically equivalent effects of radiation and chemical factors. 1...|$|R

2500|$|A {{controversy}} later arose {{over the}} planned fourth {{stage of the}} construction of Ross Dam. This argument over land became known as the High Ross Dam Controversy. The dam was built with the potential to be raised [...] further, bringing the total height of the dam to [...] and raising the reservoir to approximately [...] above sea level. The stepped [...] "concrete waffle" [...] facing {{on the front of the}} dam was designed to accommodate this addition to the height. This would have <b>flooded</b> <b>land</b> into Canada approximately [...] further, also extending up the Klesilkwa River, a Skagit River tributary, and provided the opportunity to generate about 272MW of extra power, bringing the generating capacity to 732MW. It wasn't until the 1970s when the High Ross project was finally ended. On the US side, the North Cascades Conservation Council inventoried the ancient forest of Big Beaver Creek which would have been flooded, and showed that City Light's statements that no unique forest environments would be lost were not true. On the Canadian side the raising of the dam was halted primarily by the extensive work by Curley Chittenden - logger turned environmentalist, who worked tirelessly to rally opposition to this additional flooding of the upper Skagit River basin.|$|E
