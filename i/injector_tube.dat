Comparing with a conventional slurry system, the hot system increased the transport efficiency by 2 for liquid and solid samples while it decreased the water content of the aerosol by 38 %: 9. 3 mg/min compared to 14. 8 mg/min. The heated chamber increased the signal intensities by a factor of 11 for liquid samples and by 3 for solid samples. The use of a hot nebulization gas did not contribute further to the signal enhancement of the system.

40|$|SiC {{epitaxial}} films {{grown in}} an inverted chimney CVD reactor are analyzed and compared for growth rates, doping concentration and surface morphology using silane-propane-hydrogen and dichlorosilane (DCS) -propane-hydrogen chemistry systems. A general 1 -D analytical model {{is presented to}} estimate the diffusivity of precursor gases, boundary layer thickness and growth rates for both gas systems. Decomposition of precursor gases into Si growth species is investigated by a commercial simulation tool, Virtual Reactor (VR). DCS suppresses the formation of elemental Si at lower pressures, reduces precursor losses, and leads to increased growth rate. However, at higher pressures, even DCS decomposes into elemental Si, which contributes to high Si depletion, limiting the maximum achievable growth rate. Reduction of Si loss using DCS is verified by mass measurements of parasitic depositions in the <b>injector</b> <b>tube.</b> The doping concentration of the epitaxial film is governed by the effective C/Si ratio at the growth surface rather than the inlet C/Si ratio, which is examined at various growth pressures. In addition to the widely known Si-depletion, C-depletion is also shown to exist and it plays {{a critical role in}} determining the doping concentration at various growth conditions. Increased roughness for the DCS growth at higher pressures is addressed and attributed to excessive HCl etching at higher pressures.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{characteristics and}} applications of {{inductively coupled plasma}} - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for forensic science purposes have been evaluated. Optimisation of ICP-OES for single elements using simplex techniques identified an ICP torch fitted with a wide bore <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> as most suitable for multielement analysis because of a compact analytical region in the plasma. A suitable objective function has been proposed for multielement simplex optimisation of ICP-OES and its effectiveness has been demonstrated.

40|$|A novel solution-based {{calibration}} method for quantitative spatial resolved distribution analysis (imaging) of elements in thin biological tissue sections by LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry) is described. A dual flow of the carrier and nebulizer gas is used to transport the aerosol of the laser ablated solid sample (brain tissue) {{and that of the}} nebulized aqueous standard into inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source, respectively. Both aerosols are introduced separately in the <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> inside a special ICP torch and then mixed in the inductively coupled plasma. Calibration curves were obtained via two different calibration strategies: (i) solution based calibration and (ii) with a set of well characterized homogeneous brain laboratory standards. In the first approach matrix matching is performed by solution nebulization of a series of aqueous standards with defined analyte concentrations and simultaneous laser ablation of brain homogenate followed by nebulization of 2 % (v/v) HNO 3 and laser ablation of a whole brain slice (line by line). In the second approach of calibration a set of brain homogenates with defined analyte concentrations is analyzed by LA-ICP-MS followed by the imaging of brain tissue under the same experimental conditions (dry plasma).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented {{of a novel}} vitiated coflow spray flame burner. The vitiated coflow emulates the recirculation region of most combustors, such as gas turbines or furnaces; additionally, since the vitiated gases are coflowing, the burner allows exploration of the chemistry of recirculation without the corresponding fluid mechanics of recirculation. As such, this burner allows for chemical kinetic model development without obscurations caused by fluid mechanics. The burner consists of a central fuel jet (droplet or gaseous) surrounded by the oxygen rich combustion products of a lean premixed flame that is stabilized on a perforated, brass plate. The design presented allows for the reacting coflow to span a {{large range of temperatures}} and oxygen concentrations. Several experiments measuring the relationships between mixture stoichiometry and flame temperature are used to map out the operating ranges of the coflow burner. These include temperatures as low 300 C to stoichiometric and oxygen concentrations from 18 percent to zero. This is achieved by stabilizing hydrogen-air premixed flames on a perforated plate. Furthermore, all of the CO 2 generated is from the jet combustion. Thus, a probe sample of NO(sub X) and CO 2 yields uniquely an emission index, as is commonly done in gas turbine engine exhaust research. The ability to adjust the oxygen content of the coflow allows us to steadily increase the coflow temperature surrounding the jet. At some temperature, the jet ignites far downstream from the <b>injector</b> <b>tube.</b> Further increases in the coflow temperature results in autoignition occurring closer to the nozzle. Examples are given of methane jetting into a coflow that is lean, stoichiometric, and even rich. Furthermore, an air jet with a rich coflow produced a normal looking flame that is actually 'inverted' (air on the inside, surrounded by fuel). In the special case of spray injection, we demonstrate the efficacy of this novel burner with a methanol spray in a vitiated coflow. As a proof of concept, an ensemble light diffraction (ELD) optical instrument was used to conduct preliminary measurements of droplet size distribution and liquid volume fraction...|$|E
40|$|Variable density jets {{are known}} to support {{self-sustained}} oscillations when the jet-to-ambient density ratio is sufficiently small. This change in dynamical response to small perturbations {{is associated with a}} transition from convective to absolute instability of the underlying unperturbed base flow. The focus of this dissertation lies in the use of linear stability theory to describe the convective to absolute instability transition of buoyancy-free low-density jets emerging from a circular <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> at moderately high Reynolds numbers and low Mach numbers. Particular interest is given to the in- fluence of the length of the <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> on the stability characteristics of the resulting jet flow, whose base velocity profile at the jet exit is computed in terms of the nondimen- sional tube length L_t by integrating the boundary layer equations along the injector. We begin with the investigation of inviscid axisymmetric and helical modes of in- stability in a heated jet for different values of the jet-to-ambient density ratio. For short tubes L_t â‰ª 1 the base velocity profile at the tube exit is uniform except in a thin sur- rounding boundary layer. Correspondingly, the stability analysis reproduces previous results of uniform velocity jets, according to which the jet becomes absolutely unstable to axisymmetric modes for a critical density ratio S_c â‰ƒ 0. 66, and to helical modes for S_c â‰ƒ 0. 35. For tubes of increasing length the analysis reveals that both modes exhibit absolutely unstable regions for all values of L_t and small enough values of the density ratio. In the case of the helical mode, we find that S_c increases monotonically with L_t, reaching its maximum value S â‰ƒ 0. 5 as the exit velocity approaches the Poiseuille pro- file for L_t â‰« 1. Concerning the axisymmetric mode, its associated value of S_c achieves a maximum value S_c â‰ƒ 0. 9 for _t â‰ƒ 0. 04 and then decreases to approach S_c â‰ƒ 0. 7 for L_t â‰« 1. The absolute growth rates in this limiting case of near-Poiseuille jet profiles are however extremely small for m = 0, in agreement with the fact that axisymmetric dis- turbances of a jet with parabolic profile are neutrally stable. As a result, for S < 0. 5 the absolute growth rate of the helical mode becomes larger than that of the axisymmetric mode for sufficiently large values of L_t, suggesting that the helical mode may prevail in the instability development of very light jets issuing from long injectors. A second part of this dissertation is devoted to the viscous linear instability of parallel gas flows with piecewise constant base profiles in the limit of low Mach numbers, both for planar and axisymmetric geometries such as mixing layers, jets and wakes. Our results generalize those of Drazin (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 10, 1961, p. 571), by contemplating the possibility of arbitrary jumps in density and transport properties between two uniform streams separated by a vortex sheet. The eigenfunctions, obtained analytically in the regions of uniform flow, are matched through an appropriate set of jump conditions at the discontinuity of the basic flow, which are derived by repeated integration of the linearized conservation equations in their primitive variable form. The development leads to an algebraic dispersion relation that is validated through comparisons with stability calculations performed with continuous profiles and is applied, in particular, to study the effects of molecular transport on the spatiotemporal stability of parallel nonisothermal gaseous jets and wakes with very thin shear layers. Finally {{we go back to the}} stability analysis of low-density jets emerging from circular nozzles or tubes, this time considering viscous perturbations so that the Reynolds number enters the stability problem. We consider separately the two particular cases of a hot gas jet discharging into a colder ambient of the same gas, as well as the isothermal discharge of a jet of gas with molecular weight smaller than that of the ambient gas. In both cases, we consider the detailed downstream evolution of the local stability properties in the near field of the jet with the aim at establishing the convective or absolute nature of the instability. We discuss the relationship of our results with those obtained in previous works with use made of parametric velocity and density profiles, and compare both approaches with the actual global transition observed in experiments performed with hot and light jets...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry {{for the analysis}} of solutions and slurries is reviewed. The critical parameters which affect analytical performance are identified and methods for the optimisation of the ICP for such applications demonstrated. Particle size of the suspended sample is shown {{to be the most important}} factor in the analysis of slurry samples. It is demonstrated that only particles less than 8 um in diameter reach the plasma even when the maximal diameter <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> (3 mm i. d.) is used. Accordingly various methods for the reduction of particle size have been investigated and milling shown to be the preferable approach. A low cost method using blown zirconia spheres in a screw-cap plastic bottle agitated on a flask shaker was developed. Using this method it proved possible to analyse a wide variety of solid samples using slurry atomisation using both ICP- atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with aqueous calibration. Results are presented for the elemental analysis of certified reference material (CRM) soils, catalyst samples, a zeolite, titanium dioxide, P. T. F. E. powder, and unfiltered natural waters by slurry atomisation ICP-AES. Comparison by other techniques showed excellent accuracy for major, minor and trace elements and equivalent precision to solution analysis. The CRM soils, catalysts and the zeolite were also analysed by ICP-MS using slurry atomisation with similar success and enhanced accuracy at the trace level. Aluminium proved to be an exception and generally low recoveries (80 - 90 %) were observed for this element using slurry atomisation. Finally the uses of the simplex optimisation algorithm to improve analytical performance, particularly in ICP-AES, is discussed. A computer program to facilitate the use of simplex optimisation for a variety of instrumentation was written and its use in three different analytical techniques demonstrated. The necessary hardware and software modifications to a commercially available ICP spectrometer to enable automated simplex optimisation are described.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the outlet boundary conditions for turbulent internal flow simulations. Several outlet boundary conditions have been investigated by applying the National Combustion Code (NCC) to the configuration of a LM 6000 single <b>injector</b> flame <b>tube.</b> First of all, very large eddy simulations (VLES) have been performed using the partially resolved numerical simulation (PRNS) approach, in which both the nonlinear and linear dynamic subscale models were employed. Secondly, unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier- Stokes (URANS) simulations have also been performed for the same configuration to investigate the effects of different outlet boundary conditions in the context of URANS. Thirdly, the possible role of the initial condition is inspected by using three different initial flow fields for both the PRNS/VLES simulation and the URANS simulation. The same grid is used for all the simulations and the number of mesh element is about 0. 5 million. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the long-time behavior of the solution as determined by the imposed outlet boundary conditions. For a particular simulation to be considered as successful under the given initial and boundary conditions, the solution must be sustainable in a physically meaningful manner over a sufficiently long period of time. The commonly used outlet boundary condition for steady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation is a fixed pressure at the outlet with all the other dependent variables being extrapolated from the interior. The results of the present study suggest that this is also workable for the URANS simulation of the LM 6000 <b>injector</b> flame <b>tube.</b> However, it does not work for the PRNS/VLES simulation due to the unphysical reflections of the pressure disturbances at the outlet boundary. This undesirable situation can be practically alleviated by applying a simple unsteady convection equation for the pressure disturbances at the outlet boundary. The numerical results presented in this paper suggest that this unsteady convection of pressure disturbances at the outlet works very well for all the unsteady simulations (both PRNS/VLES and URANS) of the LM 6000 single <b>injector</b> flame <b>tube...</b>|$|R
40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} {{mass spectrometry}} (LA-ICP-MS) has been established as a powerful and sensitive surface analytical technique for the determination of concentration and distribution of trace metals within biological systems at micrometer spatial resolution. LA-ICP-MS allows easy quantification procedures if suitable standard references materials (SRM) are available. In this work a new SRM-free approach of solution-based calibration method in LA-ICP-MS for element quantification in hair is described. A dual argon flow of the carrier gas and nebulizer gas is used. A dry aerosol produced by laser ablation (LA) of biological sample and a desolvated aerosol generated by pneumatic nebulization (PN) of standard solutions are carried by two different flows of argon as carrier or nebulizer gas, respectively and introduced separately in the <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> of a special ICP torch, through two separated apertures. Both argon flows are mixed directly in the ICP torch. External calibration via defined standard solutions before analysis of single hair was employed as calibration strategy. A correction factor, calculated using hair with known analyte concentration (measured by ICP-MS), is applied to correct the different elemental sensitivities of ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS. Calibration curves are obtained by plotting the ratio of analyte ion M(+) /(34) S(+) ion intensities measured using LA-ICP-MS in dependence of analyte concentration in calibration solutions. Matrix-matched on-line calibration in LA-ICP-MS is carried out by ablating of human hair strands (mounted on a sticky tape in the LA chamber) using a focused laser beam in parallel with conventional nebulization of calibration solutions. Calibrations curves of Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, I, Hg, Pb, Tl, Bi and U are presented.

40|$|The {{in-house}} code FLAMENCO {{is developed}} {{to simulate the}} mixing process in a Dry Low NOx GTU Combustor. The physical approach is defined to model 3 D-unsteady, compressible, multi-species flows where turbulence plays a major role. For this purpose, Large Eddy-Simulation is applied in conjunction with high-order schemes and stable formulation of volume fraction advection. Regarding the numerical structure, FLAMENCO is a Finite-Volume Godunov-type algorithm equipped with 5 th and 2 nd Order non-oscillatory reconstruction in space and 2 nd Order, 4 -Stages Explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for integration in time. From a mathematical point of view, the multi-species approach is governed by the 5 -Equation Transport Model and is thermodynamically defined by iso-baric and perfect gas considerations, which prevent pressure oscillations. Finally, an HLLC approximate Riemann solver computes convective fluxes and 2 nd Order centred differences accounts for dissipation terms. Previous research with an old version of FLAMENCO failed due to low dissipation in the jet <b>injector</b> <b>tube.</b> This issue stems from local energy being uncontrollably introduced in this small region, leading to unphysical pressure values. It {{was found that the}} combination of reflecting inflow, small cells and high gradients is responsible for acoustic wave reflection and amplification. To overcome this problem, a number of modifications including boundary conditions (Partially Non-reflecting, Non-reflecting and Nozzle-type subsonic inflows and outflows), an Adaptive Reconstruction Scheme, a more dissipative reconstruction scheme (5 th Order WENO) and grid changes (only in jet injector) have been introduced. As a result, local energy generation and evacuation become balanced within physical boundaries, providing stable conditions in the whole domain. Initially, extensive validation of the new numerical approach is conducted through contrasted test cases such as Stationary and Moving Contact Wave, Shock Tube Problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability and 2 D- 3 D Explosion Problems. In the same way, strategies intended to overcome the low dissipation problem are analysed in a representative configuration. After the validation process, several simulations involving coarse and fine grids and different reconstruction schemes are run in the Dry Low NOx GTU Combustor. Finally, results are compared with experimental data, showing really good accuracy for 5 th Order schemes, which is specially surprising in the coarse grid. In this way, highly turbulent, heterogeneous structures such as Vortex Breakdown, Central Recirculation Zone, Precessing Vortex Core and Secondary Vortices are very well captured, demonstrating the suitability of the mixing model to deal with highly turbulent flows where critical shear layers and high mixing ratios coexist in confined domains...|$|E

The above experiment was repeated using an ultrasonic nebuliser instead of a V-groove, high solids nebuliser and the characteristics compared. An assessment was made of a hydride generation system coupled to the ICP-MS for the analysis of selenium in blood serum. This included validation of an acid digestion technique and modification of the HG system so a separately nebulised internal standard could be used to correct for signal drift. Analysis of Seronorm(TM) reference material gave values of 77 Se+ = 77 +/- 13 mug 1 - 1, 78 Se+ = 82 +/- 9 mug 1 - 1 and 82 Se+ = 80 +/- 4 mug 1 - 1 selenium when utilising 74 Ge+ as an internal standard. The feasibility of using diluted serum in 1 % HNO 3 as a method of sample preparation prior to analysis was investigated. Results for diluted serum samples were not as good as those using digested samples. Other problems encountered were blockage of the glass <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> and sampling cone orifice leading to poor long-term stability. Overall, this work shows that the analysis of selenium in digested serum is precise and reproducible using ICP-MS with methanol addition and could be considered for routine mono-elemental analysis. The use of methanol addition allows the use of multiple isotope studies for selenium analysis with ICP-MS. Interferences are still a problem on certain selenium isotopes. The benefits of Se+ signal enhancement and the elimination of interferences on 77 Se+ when using methanol addition to sample prior to analysis for selenium in serum by ICP-MS, have clearly been demonstrated...|$|E

It has the characteristics of the very large eddy simulation (VLES) and we call this approach the partially-resolved numerical simulation (PRNS). Systematic simulations using the National Combustion Code (NCC) have been carried out for fully developed turbulent pipe flows at different Reynolds numbers to evaluate the PRNS approach.

40|$|In {{designing}} {{systems for}} the long-term storage of cryogens in low gravity space environments, one must consider the effects of thermal stratification on excessive tank pressure that will occur due to environmental heat leakage. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) concept is expected to maintain tank pressure without propellant resettling. The TVS consists of a recirculation pump, Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using {{a small amount of}} liquid extracted by the pump and passing it though the J-T valve, then through the heat exchanger, the bulk liquid and ullage are cooled, resulting in lower tank pressure. A series of TVS tests were conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using liquid nitrogen as a liquid oxygen simulant. The tests were performed at fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 % with gaseous nitrogen and helium pressurants, and with a tank pressure control band of 7 kPa. A transient one-dimensional model of the TVS is used to analyze the data. The code is comprised of four models for the heat exchanger, the spray manifold and <b>injector</b> <b>tubes,</b> the recirculation pump, and the tank. The TVS model predicted ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature are compared with data. Details of predictions and comparisons with test data regarding pressure rise and collapse rates will be presented in the final paper...|$|R

In the recent years, ozone has become very important for sterilization of water used in shrimp farming and treatment of wastewater from food industry. However, ozonisers available in the markets are very expensive and have low energy-efficiency. In this work, a highly-efficient and low-cost system that can produce high-concentrations of ozone gas and dissolved ozone in water has been developed.

40|$|A nitrous oxide-based oxygen-supply system (NOBOSS) is an {{apparatus}} {{in which a}} breathable mixture comprising 2 / 3 volume parts of N 2 and 1 / 3 volume part of O 2 is generated through dissociation of N 2 O. The NOBOSS concept {{can be adapted to}} a variety of applications in which there are requirements for relatively compact, lightweight systems to supply breathable air. These could include air-supply systems for firefighters, divers, astronauts, and workers who must be protected against biological and chemical hazards. A NOBOSS stands in contrast to compressed-gas and cryogenic air-supply systems. Compressed-gas systems necessarily include massive tanks that can hold only relatively small amounts of gases. Alternatively, gases can be stored compactly in greater quantities and at low pressures when they are liquefied, but then cryogenic equipment is needed to maintain them in liquid form. Overcoming the disadvantages of both compressed-gas and cryogenic systems, the NOBOSS exploits the fact that N 2 O can be stored in liquid form at room temperature and moderate pressure. The mass of N 2 O that can be stored in a tank of a given mass is about 20 times the mass of compressed air that can be stored in a tank of equal mass. In a NOBOSS, N 2 O is exothermically dissociated to N 2 and O 2 in a main catalytic reactor. In order to ensure the dissociation of N 2 O to the maximum possible extent, the temperature of the reactor must be kept above 400 C. At the same time, to minimize concentrations of nitrogen oxides (which are toxic), it is necessary to keep the reactor temperature at or below 540 C. To keep the temperature within the required range throughout the reactor and, in particular, to prevent the formation of hot spots that would be generated by local concentrations of the exothermic dissociation reaction, the N 2 O is introduced into the reactor through an <b>injector</b> <b>tube</b> that features carefully spaced holes to distribute the input flow of N 2 O widely throughout the reactor. A NOBOSS includes one or more "destroyer" subsystems for removing any nitrogen oxides that remain downstream of the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. A destroyer includes a carbon bed in series with a catalytic reactor, and is in thermal contact with the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. The gas mixture that leaves the main reactor first goes through a carbon bed, which adsorbs all of the trace NO and most of the trace NO 2. The gas mixture then goes through the destroyer catalytic reactor, wherein most or all of the remaining NO 2 is dissociated. A NOBOSS can be designed to regulate its reactor temperature across a range of flow rates. One such system includes three destroyer loops; these loops act, in combination with a heat sink, to remove heat from the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. In this system, the N 2 O and product gases play an additional role as coolants; thus, as needed, the coolant flow increases in proportion to the rate of generation of heat, helping to keep the main-reactor temperature below 540 C...|$|E

40|$|Flashback, {{a problem}} that occurs in premixed-prevaporized combustors, is the {{upstream}} propagation of the flame from the combustor into the premixing tubes. Not only does flashback change the combustion process from premixed burning to diffusion burning, thus creating more pollutants, but it also inflicts considerable damage to the fuel <b>injector,</b> premixing <b>tube</b> and other equipment upstream. The conditions at which flashback occurs in steady burning and the mechanism that causes flashback in both steady and transient flow are studied. The equivalence ratio at which flashback occurs is being measured for inlet temperatures of 600 - 950 K, premixer wall temperatures of 450 - 1050 K and premixer velocities of 40 - 80 ft/s.

40|$|High thrust-to-weight {{ratio and}} {{consistent}} performance over {{a range of}} operating conditions make cryogenic rocket engines {{one of the best}} options for space propulsion. However, future space explorations and missions to moon, mars and beyond require improvements in our present knowledge of the rocket engine combustion technology. In order to help improve the performance and reliability of current rocket engine combustors, several key issues need to be considered. Injector performance is one such issue related {{to the development of a}} new generation of rocket engine combustors. Previous research has suggested that coaxial injectors are most preferable for injection of cryogenic propellants inside the combustion chamber because of their simple design, low losses and high combustion stability. An experimental facility was designed and fabricated to simulate a single element shear coaxial injector. Gases of different densities were injected through the annulus between the two <b>injector</b> <b>tubes</b> over a large range of velocities, while liquid nitrogen flows through the inner tube. In this research, liquid nitrogen was used to simulate liquid oxygen because it is very similar to liquid oxygen, chemically inert, easy and safe to install in laboratory testing. High speed cinematography and Schlieren imaging have been used to examine the evolutionary flow behavior and global features of the liquid nitrogen jet, while PIV imaging was used to characterize the gaseous flow. This research has analyzed the transient behavior and unfolds the detailed evolutionary characteristics of both the cryogenic liquid and gaseous phase evolving from the shear coaxial injector for the first time. The effect of density ratio, velocity ratio and momentum ratio on the behavior of steady-state liquid nitrogen jet from a coaxial injector at atmospheric pressure has also been examined in detail. The impact of these parameters on primary instability of liquid core, the shear/spreading angle and its potential core length have been examined. Furthermore, the impact of some of the important non-dimensional numbers such as, Reynolds number, Weber number and Prandtl number, have been examined to develop scaling laws for the prediction of cryogenic potential core lengths. New correlations have been provided that describes the cryogenic jet behavior under simulated rocket injector operating conditions...|$|R
