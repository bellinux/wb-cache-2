25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (<b>HP)</b> <b>turbine</b> rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E

500|$|The double-expansion engines {{consist of}} a {{high-pressure}} (<b>HP)</b> <b>turbine</b> and a low-pressure (LP) turbine. The steam is first passed through the <b>HP</b> <b>turbine</b> which turns at up to 2,100 [...] rpm. The steam, largely depleted at this point, is then passed through a large conduit to the LP turbine. By the time it reaches the LP turbine, it has no more than 50 psi (300 kPa) of pressure left. The LP turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the LP turbine, the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3 [...] liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship's potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and {{all but one of}} the toilets on the Iowa class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the <b>HP</b> <b>turbine,</b> can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through reduction gearing that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship. [...] The Iowas were to be outfitted with four screws: the outer pair consisting of two four-bladed propellers roughly [...] in diameter and the inboard screws that have five blades and are roughly [...] in diameter. The propeller designs were adopted after earlier testing had determined that propeller cavitation caused a drop in efficiency at speeds over [...] [...] The two inner shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the flow of water to the propellers and improve the structural strength of the stern. The engineering plant on Iowa and Missouri consisted of four General Electric cross-compound steam turbine engines, each driving a single shaft. The equivalent machinery on New Jersey and Wisconsin was provided by Westinghouse.|$|E

500|$|Coal is {{fed into}} one of 30 coal bunkers, each with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 tonnes. Each bunker feeds two of the 60 pulverisers, each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour. [...] The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane. In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>turbine,</b> one intermediate pressure (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. The HP turbines generate at 140 megawatts (MW). Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660MW: with six generating sets, the station has a total capacity of 3,960MW. Each of the generating units is equipped with the Advanced Plant Management System (APMS), a system developed by RWE npower and Thales, and implemented by Capula.|$|E
500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the <b>HP</b> <b>turbine,</b> which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to create a}} high-fidelity Navier-Stokes computer simulation of the flow through the turbines of a modern high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine. The simulation would have to capture the aerodynamic interactions between closely coupled high- and low-pressure turbines. A computer simulation of the flow in the GE 90 turbofan engine's high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) turbines was created at GE Aircraft Engines under contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center. The three-dimensional steady-state computer simulation was performed using Glenn's average-passage approach named APNASA. The areas upstream and downstream of each blade row mutually interact with each other during engine operation. The embedded blade row operating conditions are modeled since the average passage equations in APNASA actively include the effects of the adjacent blade rows. The turbine airfoils, platforms, and casing are actively cooled by compressor bleed air. Hot gas leaks around the tips of rotors through labyrinth seals. The flow exiting the high work <b>HP</b> <b>turbines</b> is partially transonic and, therefore, has a strong shock system in the transition region. The simulation was done using 121 processors of a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 (NAS 02 K) cluster at the NASA Ames Research Center, with a parallel efficiency of 87 percent in 15 hr. The typical average-passage analysis mesh size per blade row was 280 by 45 by 55, or approx. 700, 000 grid points. The total number of blade rows was 18 for a combined <b>HP</b> and LP <b>turbine</b> system including the struts in the transition duct and exit guide vane, which contain 12. 6 million grid points.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the European {{research}} project RECORD, the flow field within a <b>HP</b> axial-flow <b>turbine</b> model was investigated experimentally for several operating conditions. A number of studies on stator-rotor interaction in <b>HP</b> <b>turbines</b> for subsonic as well as transonic/supersonic conditions were proposed in the last decades, but none of them compared different conditions for the same geometry. In this paper, the transonic condition is investigated and compared to three subsonic ones, in {{the frame of}} an entirely new experimental campaign. The research was performed at the Laboratorio di Fluidodinamica delle Macchine of the Politecnico di Milano (Italy), where a cold-flow, closed-loop test rig is available for detailed studies on turbines and compressors. The boundary conditions resulted in keeping constant both the turbine inlet temperature and the stage outlet absolute flow direction; so far, while the expansion ratio was varied, the rotational speed was also modified accordingly. The analysis was performed by means of a conventional five hole probe in the stator - rotor axial gap and by a fast response aerodynamic probe downstream of the rotor. The local time-averaged and phase-resolved flow field was then derived and used to analyze the stage aerodynamics and performance. Results show that the stage expansion ratio has a dramatic impact on both the rotor aerodynamics and stage performance. In particular, Mach number effects are recognized in the stator cascade that passes from transonic to low subsonic conditions. On the rotor cascade the reduction of expansion ratio reduces significantly the Mach and Reynolds numbers and increases the incidence angle as well; the rotor loss mechanics as well as the vane-rotor interaction are greatly amplified. Correspondingly a significant variation of stage overall efficiency is recorded...|$|R
