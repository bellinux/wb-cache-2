40|$|The {{directed}} design {{modifications to}} the Skylab/ATM CMG for application to the Power Module include new rotors of a different material with high resistance to stress corrosion cracking. The spin bearing retainer fix which was determined during the post Skylab mission was incorporated, and the speed pickoff was improved {{through the use of}} pickoff thermal cycling screening tests. The unlimited <b>gimbal</b> <b>freedom</b> on box axes was incorporated using slip ring assemblies. The on-orbit replacement capability was also incorporated for the CMG assembly and the inverter assembly...|$|E
40|$|A {{steering}} law {{is presented}} which {{has all the}} features required for space applications, assuming the CMG outer <b>gimbal</b> <b>freedom</b> is unlimited. The reason {{is the idea of}} mounting all the outer gimbal axes of the CMGs parallel to each other. This allows the decomposition of the steering law problem into a linear one for the inner gimbal angle rates and a planar one for the outer gimbal angle rates. The inner gimbal angle rates are calculated first, since they are not affected by the outer gimbal angle rates. For the calculation of the outer rates, the inner rates are then known quantities. An outer gimbal angle distribution function (to avoid singularities internal to the total angular momentum envelope) generates distribution rates next, and finally the pseudoinverse method is used to insure that the desired total torque is delivered...|$|E
40|$|Four 4760 Nms (3510 ft-lbf-s) Double Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscopes (DGCMG) with {{unlimited}} <b>gimbal</b> <b>freedom</b> {{about each}} axis were {{adopted by the}} International Space Station (ISS) Program as the non-propulsive solution for continuous attitude control. These CMGs with a life expectancy of approximately 10 years contain a flywheel spinning at 691 rad/s (6600 rpm) and can produce an output torque of 258 Nm (190 ft-lbf) 1. One CMG unexpectedly failed after approximately 1. 3 years and one developed anomalous behavior after approximately six years. Both units were returned to earth for failure investigation. This paper describes the Space Station Double Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscope design, on-orbit telemetry signatures and {{a summary of the}} results of both failure investigations. The lessons learned from these combined sources have lead to improvements in the design that will provide CMGs with greater reliability to assure the success of the Space Station. These lessons learned and design improvements are not only applicable to CMGs but can be applied to spacecraft mechanisms in general...|$|E
50|$|The turn {{indicator}} is a gyroscopic instrument that {{works on the}} principle of precession. The gyro is mounted in a gimbal. The gyro's rotational axis is in-line with the lateral (pitch) axis of the aircraft, while the <b>gimbal</b> has limited <b>freedom</b> around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Mounting of double-gimbaled control moment gyros (CMG's) of {{unlimited}} outer <b>gimbal</b> angle <b>freedom</b> {{with all}} their outer gimbal axes parallel allows drastic simplification of the CMG steering law development hardware. The advantages of the parallel mounting for the CMG steering law development are such that a law could be developed which is applicable to any number of CMG's with arbitrary angular momentum. Parallel mounting of the CMG's {{in conjunction with the}} steering law can therefore be considered a CMG kit suitable for many missions of differing momentum requirements. It also means that increasing momentum demands during the design phase of a space vehicle can be easily met by the addition of one or more CMG's of the original momentum capacity rather than a redesign to a larger momentum capacity. Another advantage of the parallel mounting is that the failure of any CMG can be treated like any other, i. e., only one failure mode is possible. The CMG steering law distributes the CMG momentum vectors such that all inner gimbal angles are equal which reduces the rate requirements on the outer gimbal axes. The steering law also spreads the outer gimbals which ensures avoidance of singularities internal to the angular momentum envelope...|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgeries, as {{they require}} minimal incisions relative to open surgery, facilitate postoperative recovery, improve cosmesis, and reduce pain. Medical instruments are introduced through 0. 5 - 1. 5 cm incisions in laparoscopy, or through natural body orifices in NOTES. ^ Manual {{manipulation of the}} surgical instruments is required by surgical staff, and maneuvering of these instruments, including the endoscope with an attached camera, {{is limited by the}} fulcrum created by the entry point. The instrumentation used for laparoscopic surgery diminishes the working envelope of instruments, relative to open surgery. ^ A remotely operated surgical assistant (ROSA) system has been developed, without the maneuverability limitations of previous devices, to further improve minimally invasive surgical procedures. While the developed system could be used to automatically and remotely move a number of devices inside a body during surgery, a prototype system orients a miniature camera. A wireless camera system fixed inside a 2 degree of <b>freedom</b> <b>gimbal</b> device is placed into the body during a minimally invasive surgery, and its orientation is automatically manipulated by external magnetic fields to follow a point of interest. A small neodymium magnet fixed to the camera is magnetically coupled to a larger permanent magnet outside the body. Two motors orient the pitch and roll rotations of the exterior magnet on a gimbal device. Automated vision tracking was implemented with the ROSA system to follow a point of interest during surgery. Step response testing showed that the internal camera can be oriented at approximately 10 degrees/second with a proportional controller of gain 0. 3. The ROSA system was found to be functional with up to 12 inches separating interior and exterior magnets, and calibration schemes to automatically determine relative angular orientation between inner and outer systems were found to be effective. ^ The system offers many benefits to patients, as fewer incisions are required for use of ROSA. Further, the system improves surgery for staff, as the camera field of view is augmented and automated, and crowding is mitigated. ...|$|R
