50|$|Drywall {{finishers}} use {{the mesh}} frequently. In fact, {{it is common}} to replace the paper tape used to float the joint between two pieces of drywall. The mesh that drywall finishers use comes on a roll just like paper <b>drywall</b> <b>tape.</b> The added benefit for the drywall finisher is to roll out the mesh over a great distance before having to apply the first coat of joint compound. Not only does it help them in this manner, but it also causes a stronger bond between the joint compound, the tape and the wall.|$|E
40|$|Stud Framing, <b>Drywall,</b> and <b>Tape</b> and Finishing trade-work {{is a major}} {{component}} of every building project. Labor productivity is the largest single variable affecting of the Framing and Drywall contractors 2 ̆ 7 cost of performance. In spite of these facts, no major study of labor productivity in this major construction trade has previously been done. This study was undertaken to fill this gap in the literature; specifically to investigate external impacts to labor productivity in this construction sector. The study measured the impact of thirty-eight (38) variables on 226 separate projects. The study found that poor quality design documents, unexpected labor congestion, fragmentation, and overtime and added shift work negatively impacted labor productivity. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc...|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the painter}} was {{responsible}} for the mixing of the paint; keeping a ready supply of pigments, oils, thinners and driers. The painter would use his experience to determine a suitable mixture depending {{on the nature of the}} job. In modern times, the painter is primarily responsible for preparation of the surface to be painted, such as patching holes in <b>drywall,</b> using masking <b>tape</b> and other protection on surfaces not to be painted, applying the paint and then cleaning up.|$|R
40|$|The Challenge: Based on {{analysis}} of the Supplementary Data System (BLS), the compensable injury/incidence rate (27. 5 cases per 100 workers for this group) for drywall installers was nearly three times the injury rate of 9. 5 for all other construction occupations combined, in 1987. In 1994, falls (29. 9 %), overexertion (25. 9 %), and contact with objects (25. 1 %) were the leading events of injury and illness involving days away from work. As a result, sprains and strains (43. 3 %) constituted the most frequent nature of injuries and illnesses category in 1994. Approach: The project examined different approaches to estimating the population of at risk drywall installers, using occupational injury classification data from the BLS. In addition, three parallel efforts were undertaken to identify high-risk activities associated with the traumatic injuries and overexertion hazards of drywall installation work: 1) {{analysis of}} videotaped data; 2) analysis of biomechanical stresses associated with drywall lifting; and 3) completion of a drywall installation survey identifying high-risk tasks and activities. In the laboratory component, simulations were conducted to evaluate the biomechanical stresses associated with drywall handling techniques identified from the field investigation. Force platform and motion analysis techniques {{were used to determine}} forces, moments, postural instability, and postures during simulated drywall handling tasks. A simulated drywall lifting workstation was built and all subjects performed one of the four randomly assigned lifting methods. Both center of pressure (COP) and center of mass (COM) data were analyzed to assess postural stability of workers. Results: All the ratings of fall potential, perceived physical stress, and risk of being struck by or against objects while hanging drywall on the ceiling were greater than while performing the other two tasks. Activities involving lifting/carrying/holding drywall sheets were rated as most physically stressful. Workers perceived greater physical stress for the two drywall sanding tasks than the four taping tasks. Sanding skimmed drywall without the use of pole sanders, in particular sanding ceiling joints, nails, and corners was rated most stressful. Wrists/hands and shoulders were identified as the most affected body part subject to physical stress during <b>drywall</b> <b>taping</b> and sanding. Tasks performed with the use of stilts were rated as having greater fall potential than those without using stilts. Statistically significant results from the univariate analyses and PCA indicated that the three horizontal lifting methods created less perturbation than the vertical lifting method. Impact: The field study component has not only collected useful data from these worksites, but also established excellent collaborative opportunities and research partnerships for NIOSH. This study also represented the first large-scale, worker-based, and construction-related laboratory study, which was conducted to evaluate the biomechanical stresses associated with the lifting of large-sized manual materials. Drywall installers, carpenters, painters and construction laborers are responsible for almost 50 % of fall-related injuries in the construction industry. All of these four construction workforces handle drywall at worksites. The recommendations of this project can be extrapolated to apply and benefit the previously-mentioned four construction workforces, which represent 3. 3 million construction workers. The study results were also referenced and used for wallboard-related legislative actions in Washington State in June, 2000. The study findings provided strategies for controlling physical stresses and fall hazards in drywall-installation work, thereby promoting the safety of this sector of the construction population.

5000|$|A taping {{knife or}} joint knife is a drywall tool {{with a wide}} blade for {{spreading}} joint compound, also known as [...] "mud". It {{can be used to}} spread mud over nail and screw indents in new drywall applications and is also used when using paper or fiberglass <b>drywall</b> <b>tape</b> to cover seams. Other common uses include patching holes, smoothing wall-coverings and creating specialty artistic wall finishes. Common sizes range from 15cm to 30cm wide (five to 12 inches). Spackle knives are a smaller version, used for patching small holes.|$|E
50|$|Ready-mixed joint {{compound}} is {{most commonly used}} in hanging drywall for new or remodeled homes. Application is simple and easy, usually never taking more than three or four coats. When used for new walls, {{joint compound}} effectively eliminates all blemishes {{from the surface of}} the drywall, such as fasteners, damage, or <b>drywall</b> <b>tape.</b> Joint compound is used to finish gypsum panel joints, corner bead, trim and fasteners, as well as skim coating. In addition, it is also very handy for fixing minor blemishes or damages to walls. It easily patches up holes, bumps, tears, and other minor damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{porosity}} of the board—introduced during manufacturing {{to reduce}} {{the weight of the}} board, lowering construction time and transportation costs—enables water to rapidly reach the core through capillary action, where mold can grow inside. Water that enters a room from overhead may cause ceiling <b>drywall</b> <b>tape</b> to separate from the ceiling {{as a result of the}} grooves immediately behind the tape where the drywall pieces meet becoming saturated. The drywall may also soften around the screws holding the drywall in place and with the aid of gravity, the weight of the water may cause the drywall to sag and eventually collapse, requiring replacement.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as drywall taping mud, joint compound is the primary material used in the drywall industry by a tradesperson, or applicator, called a [...] "drywall mechanic," [...] "taper," [...] or [...] "drywall taper." [...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for gypsum panel walls and ceilings that have been pre-sealed and coated with joint compound. The flexibility and plastic qualities of joint compound make it a very versatile material both as sealer or finishing coat for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from machine sprayed texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes. In North America the application of joint mud and <b>drywall</b> <b>tape</b> sealer and trowelled joint compound on gypsum panels is a standard construction technique for painted wall and ceiling surfaces. Until more recently in North America, and through the world, several different plasters such as veneer plaster and [...] "plaster of Paris" [...] {{have been used in}} a similar ways to joint compounds as fillers or for decorative purposes since ancient times, and the actual make up and working properties of these compounds is much similar. Modern ready-mixes or powder and water mixes are available {{in a wide range of}} styles from slow-drying to quick-drying to suit specific demands for use by contractors or decorators.|$|E
