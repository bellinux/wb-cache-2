5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (<b>eared</b> seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the <b>eared</b> seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E

40|$|We propose an <b>ear</b> {{recognition}} {{system based}} on 2 D <b>ear</b> images which includes three stages: <b>ear</b> enrollment, feature extraction, and <b>ear</b> recognition. <b>Ear</b> enrollment includes <b>ear</b> detection and <b>ear</b> normalization. The <b>ear</b> detection approach based on improved Adaboost algorithm detects the <b>ear</b> part under complex background using two steps: offline cascaded classifier training and online <b>ear</b> detection. Then Active Shape Model is applied to segment the <b>ear</b> part and normalize all the <b>ear</b> images to the same size. For its eminent characteristics in spatial local feature extraction and orientation selection, Gabor filter based <b>ear</b> feature extraction is presented in this paper. Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) is then applied for dimension reduction of the high-dimensional Gabor features. Finally distance based classifier is applied for <b>ear</b> recognition. Experimental results of <b>ear</b> recognition on two datasets (USTB and UND datasets) {{and the performance of}} the <b>ear</b> authentication system show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

5|$|Pinnipeds {{split from}} other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene.

5|$|The California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal <b>eared</b> seal native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks.|$|E
5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{is closely related}} to the <b>eared</b> dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the {{mourning dove}}, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The <b>eared</b> dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, <b>eared</b> grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and <b>eared</b> seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} (Podiceps nigricollis), known in North America as the <b>eared</b> grebe, {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|E
