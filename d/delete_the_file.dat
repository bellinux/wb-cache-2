50|$|By default, shred also shreds file slack (unused {{space in}} file allocations). For example, a 5 KB file on a file system with 4 KB {{clusters}} actually requires 8 KB of storage.

5000|$|As {{the trial}} date approached, {{it became known}} that Mesa's chief {{financial}} officer, George [...] "Peter" [...] Murnane III, had e-mailed an acquaintance {{about a week after}} Hawaiian filed suit, first asking for information about how to delete files {{in such a way that}} they could not be discovered, then confirming that <b>the</b> <b>files</b> in question were deleted. Mesa placed Murnane on paid administrative leave on September 22, 2007. [...] Hawaiian contended that Murnane <b>deleted</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> maliciously in an attempt to destroy evidence that would show that Mesa improperly used confidential data. Mesa contended that Murnane accidentally <b>deleted</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> in question in an attempt to remove pornographic material from his computer.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{ensuring}} data provenance in computing is to mark a file as read only. This allows {{the user to}} view the contents of <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally <b>deleting</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} occurs when some updaters and uninstallers rename or <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> oledlg.dll, preventing {{the operating system}} from loading unicows.dll. This results in applications, such as OpenOffice.org, reporting that [...] "Application cannot start {{because one of the}} required libraries cannot be found." [...] This occurs even if unicows.dll is installed in the system.|$|E
50|$|Virus hoaxes {{are usually}} {{harmless}} and accomplish {{nothing more than}} annoying people who identify it as a hoax and waste the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of hoaxes have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the jdbgmgr.exe virus hoax and the SULFNBK.EXE hoax.|$|E
50|$|The {{component}} {{became famous}} in the early 2000s as {{the subject of an}} e-mail hoax. The hoax claimed that SULFNBK.EXE was a virus, and contained instructions to locate and <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> While the instructions worked, they were needless and (in some rare cases, for example, when the long file names are damaged and need to be restored) can cause disruptions, as SULFNBK.EXE is not a virus, but instead an operating system component.|$|E

50|$|To {{create a}} more robust and {{complete}} system for searching, Gnutella2 also has a metadata system for more complete labeling, rating, and quality information to be given in the search results than would simply be gathered by <b>the</b> <b>file</b> names. Nodes can even share this information after they have <b>deleted</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> allowing users to mark viruses and worms on the network, without requiring them to keep a copy.|$|R
50|$|When a directory's sticky bit is set, the {{filesystem}} {{treats the}} files in such directories {{in a special}} way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically this is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files.|$|E

5000|$|On December 17, 2010, the BBC {{featured}} Yamaguchi in its comedy program QI, {{referring to}} him as [...] "The Unluckiest Man in the World". Both Stephen Fry, the host of QI, and celebrity guests drew laughter from the audience in a segment that included examples of black humor such as asking if the bomb had [...] "landed on him and bounced off". A clip from the episode was uploaded by the BBC after the show but was later deleted.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{use of the}} sticky bit is on {{directories}} residing within filesystems for Unix-like operating systems. When a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root can rename or <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically, this is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files. This feature was introduced in 4.3BSD in 1986, and today it is found in most modern Unix-like systems.|$|E
5000|$|Paging {{has been}} a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.0 in 1990. Windows 3.x creates a hidden file named 386SPART.PAR or WIN386.SWP {{for use as a}} swap file. It is {{generally}} found in the root directory, but it may appear elsewhere (typically in the WINDOWS directory). Its size depends on how much swap space the system has (a setting selected by the user under Control Panel → Enhanced under [...] "Virtual Memory"). If the user moves or deletes this file, a blue screen will appear the next time Windows is started, with the error message [...] "The permanent swap file is corrupt". The user will be prompted to choose whether or not to <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> (whether or not it exists).|$|E
50|$|In Unix-like systems, user-space {{programs}} do not operate directly, at a low level, on a file. Only the kernel deals with files, and it handles all user-space interaction with files {{in a manner that}} is transparent to the user-space programs. The operating system provides a level of abstraction, which means that interaction with a file from user-space is simply through its filename (instead of its filehandle). For example, rm filename will not <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> itself, but only a link to the file. There can be many links to a file, but when they are all removed, the kernel considers that file's memory space free to be reallocated. This free space is commonly considered a security risk (due to the existence of file recovery software). Any secure-deletion program uses kernel-space (system) functions to wipe the file's data.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the importing and editing process is heavily dependent on <b>the</b> amount of <b>file</b> fragmentation of <b>the</b> hard disk. The most reliable results {{can be obtained by}} adding an extra hard disk dedicated for scratch space, and regularly re-formatting/defragmenting it, rather than simply <b>deleting</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> at <b>the</b> end of the project. Fragmented AVI files result in jerky playback on the editing screen, and make the final rendering process much longer.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, {{a number}} of {{critical}} files - expensive, high res images of the ocean floor - disappeared suddenly from <b>the</b> <b>file</b> servers where they were stored.

5000|$|Sticky bit has {{the final}} decision. If sticky bit and GUID {{had not been}} set, the user 'wozniak' could rename, move, or <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> named 'thoughts' because the {{directory}} named 'blog' allows read and write by group, and wozniak belongs to the group, and the default 0002 umask allows new files to be edited by group.

50|$|The Recycle Bin has {{a setting}} to {{configure}} {{the amount of}} deleted files it can store. Free disk space allocated for this is not actually used until files are deleted from folders and stored in the Recycle Bin. In versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista, the default configuration of the Recycle Bin is a global setting for all drives to hold 10% of the total capacity of each host hard drive volume to store deleted files. For example, on a volume with a capacity of 20 gigabytes, the Recycle Bin will hold up to 2 gigabytes of deleted files. This can be changed anywhere from 0 to 100% of the drive space, but {{will not be allowed}} to exceed 3.99GB of space, even if the user-indicated % of the drive space is larger than 3.99GB. If the Recycle Bin fills up to maximum capacity, the oldest files will be deleted in order to accommodate the newly deleted files. If a file is too large for the Recycle Bin, the user will be prompted to immediately and permanently <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> instead. This 3.99GB limit does not apply in Windows Vista and later Windows versions.|$|E
5000|$|Rebecca {{discovers the}} files on Theresa's laptop that she {{discovered}} in her mother's house and scanned which proved that Ethan's mother, Ivy, had an adulterous {{affair with her}} ex-lover, Sam Bennett, {{on the night of}} her wedding to Julian, thus conceiving Ethan. Theresa was planning on showing Ethan the information, releasing him from any pressure to marry [...] "within his class". Pilar forbid Theresa to tell Ethan the truth, and insisted she <b>delete</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> but not before Gwen and Rebecca stumbled across it. With Gwen collaboratively distracting Ivy and Theresa, Rebecca anonymously send the information to the tabloid Daily Private Lives, believing that Theresa will not want to marry Ethan once his true, middle-class paternity is known (as Rebecca at initially did not realize that the computer belonged to Theresa until Gwen told her). The truth comes out at Ethan and Theresa's engagement party in February 2001, and Gwen is surprised to find that Theresa stays with Ethan even after he is disowned. Gwen also realized that Theresa lied to Ethan by telling him that she had no knowledge of his paternity prior to the tabloid story.|$|E

50|$|Hard links use {{the same}} MFT entry as <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>file.</b> Adding a hard link creates a new name attribute and increases the hard link count (for a newly created file this count equals to one).
