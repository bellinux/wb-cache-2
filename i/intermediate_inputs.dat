50|$|The second {{contribution}} towards localization economies is {{the access}} to specialized goods and services provided for the clustering firms. This access to specialized goods and services are known as <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> and provides increasing returns to scale {{for each of the}} firms located within that area because of the proximity to available sources needed for production. If <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> are tradable, there forms a core-periphery notion that will have many firms locate near each other to be closer to their needed sources. If there are tradable resources and services nearby but no related industries in the same area, there are no networking linkages and therefore makes it difficult for all firms in the area to obtain resources and increase production. The decreased transportation costs associated with clustering of firms leads to the increase in likelihood to a core-periphery pattern; where the result of this will be more <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> will be focused at the core and therefore will attract more firms in related industries.|$|E

Since market power in input purchase has been growing in recent years, it is worth examining the welfare implications of trade arising from oligopsony power. We develop a model consisting of two final goods, one intermediate good, and two primary factors (capital and labor). One final good and the intermediate good employ primary factors, whereas the other final good uses labor and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>input.</b> All markets operate under perfect competition except for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>input,</b> which is oligopsonistic.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of economies that are {{considered}} large-scale and have external economies of scale; localization and urbanization economies. Localization economies arise from many firms in the same industry located close to each other.

The second benefit is the development of industries due to the increasing returns to scale in <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> for a product; and the third source is the relative ease of communication and exchange of supplies, laborers and innovative ideas due to the proximity among firms.|$|E

Specifically, when activities must be coordinated across geographies, the term global value chain (GVC) is used in the development literature.

50|$|The 1960s saw an {{acceleration}} and diversification {{of the manufacturing}} sector to meet domestic demand, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> and consumer durable goods. By 1971 these accounted for about 50 percent of industrial output. Still, manufactured products—mainly processed agricultural goods—made up only about 10 percent of Ecuador's exports in 1971. Industry was still at an early stage of development, and about 50 percent of the labor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Traditional industries, such as food processing, beverages, and textiles, were largely dependent on agriculture. The small size of the domestic market, the high production cost in relation to available external markets, and an undeveloped human, physical, and financial infrastructure all combined to limit the expansion of consumer durable goods in the Ecuadorian economy.|$|E
