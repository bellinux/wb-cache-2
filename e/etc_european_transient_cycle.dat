Control goals are to fulll the legislated emission levels and safe {{operations of the}} engine and the turbocharger. These goals are achieved through regulation of the following performance variables: normalized air/fuel ratio, intake manifold EGR-fraction as well as turbocharger speed. A systematic tuning strategy for the PID controllers is also developed and the tuning rules and their performance is successfully illustrated on a demanding part of the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle.</b> Further, it is demonstrated that the VGT-position to turbocharger speed loop does benet from a derivative part in order to predict high turbocharger speeds. This {{is due to the}} large time constant in the corresponding open-loop transfer function. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R
40|$|An engine mapping-based {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in order to be}} able to make a first approximation of the engine performance and emissions during a speed/torque vs. time <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle.</b> The procedure is based on a previous steady-state experimental investigation of the engine for the formulation of polynomial expressions of all interesting engine properties with respect to engine speed and torque. Correction coefficients are then applied to account for transient discrepancies based on individual transient experiments. The developed algorithm was applied for the case of a heavy-duty diesel engine running on the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle.</b> A comparative analysis was performed for each section of the Cycle, which revealed that the first part (urban driving) is responsible for the biggest amount of emissions (in g) owing to the most frequent and abrupt load changes involved. The obvious advantage of the proposed methodology is the fact that the effect of internal or external (after-treatment) measures can be easily incorporated in the code and quantified in terms of emissions improvement.

40|$|A {{systematic}} design method for reducing bias in observers is developed. The method utilizes an observable default {{model of the}} system together with measurement data from the real system and estimates a model augmentation. The augmented model is then used to design an observer which reduces the estimation bias compared to an observer based on the default model. Three main results are a characterization of possible augmentations from observability perspectives, a parameterization of the augmentations from the method, and a robustness analysis of the proposed augmentation estimation method.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of transient turbocharged diesel engine operation {{appeared in the}} early seventies and continues to be in the focal point of research, due to the importance of transient response in the everyday operating conditions of engines. The majority of research has focused so far on issues concerning thermodynamic modeling, as these directly affect performance and pollutants' emissions. On the other hand, issues concerning the dynamics of transient operation are usually over-simplified, possibly for the sake of speeding up program execution time. In the present work, an experimentally validated transient diesel engine simulation code is used to study and evaluate the importance of the lubricating oil properties (oil-type, viscosity, temperature) on the transient response of a turbocharged diesel engine. It is revealed how the lubricating oil affects mechanical friction and hence, the speed response {{as well as the other}} interesting parameters, e. g. fuel pump rack position or turbocharger operating point for load-change schedules typical in the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycles</b> for heavy-duty engines. Particularly under low ambient conditions, the high oil viscosity is responsible for a significant increase in the respective frictional losses worsening the engine transient response.

The catalyst produced by this line was tested on a bench scale diesel engine. The V 2 O 5 -WO 3 /TiO 2 powder catalyst prepared in the laboratory and production line both achieved > 80 % NOx conversion at 200 - 450 degrees C and a GHSV of 50000 h(- 1). The washcoated catalyst used a large cordierite support and gave > 80 % NOx conversion at 250 - 450 degrees C and GHSVs of 10000 - 30000 h(- 1). The engine bench tests showed that after treatment by the catalyst, the NOx emission met the European steady-state <b>cycle</b> (ESC) and <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> (<b>ETC)</b> limits of the China IV standard.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{a catalyst}} for hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR) exhaust aftertreatment has been examined by means of transient experiments on a heavy-duty diesel engine rig. The influences of temperature, NO 2 concentration, and the transient injection of hydrocarbon on the conversion of NO,, CO, and hydrocarbon were studied in a systematic manner. Hydrocarbon conversion was high and NO, conversion {{was related to the}} amount of injected hydrocarbon at high temperatures. At lower temperatures hydrocarbon conversion was low and NOx conversion was not directly related to hydrocarbon injection rate. Increased exhaust NO 2 /NO ratio resulted in NOx conversion at lower temperatures and also in accumulation of NO., on the catalyst surface. The findings are in agreement with results from recent studies of the selective catalytic reduction of NO by propene. A catalyst model was designed in accordance to these studies and fitted to results from tailored and standard <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycles</b> (<b>ETC).</b> The model shows reasonable agreement with experimental CO, NO, and NO 2) data. Experimental hydrocarbon data are not as well reproduced, presumably due to the model approximation of hydrocarbons to one species.

40|$|Adverse {{health effects}} of ambient air {{pollution}} are well recognised and include increased morbidity and mortality in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Diesel engines are major contributors to ambient particulate matter pollution and diesel particles {{have been shown to}} have strong toxicological and oxidative properties. Mechanistic aspects of diesel engine exhaust exposure have been investigated in bronchial mucosal biopsies sampled during bronchoscopy of human subjects exposed in a validated experimental exposure set-up. Two exposure series were performed. Two separate groups of 15 healthy subjects each were exposed to filtered air and diesel exhaust during 1 hour in random order. The first exposure series was performed with the engine at idling with a PM 10 concentration of 300 µg/m 3 and the second was carried out during urban <b>cycle</b> (<b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle)</b> running conditions with 270 µg particles/m 3. Bronchoscopies with sampling of bronchial mucosal biopsies were performed 6 hours after exposure. Biopsies fixed in acetone were bedded in glycolmethacrylate (GMA) resin and were stained for immunohistochemistry. Readings were done with light microscopy as well as image analyser with digital stainings processing of. Diesel exhaust enhanced the expression of the cytokines IL- 8 and GRO-α in the bronchial epithelium suggesting that the epithelium {{plays a major role in}} mediating the neutrophil-dominated airway mucosal inflammation. The bronchial expression of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines was evaluated, addressing the hypothesis that diesel exhaust would induce a Th 2 airway response. Diesel exhaust enhanced the expression of Th 2 related cytokine IL- 13 whereas the expression of Th 1 cytokines was unaffected. The investigation of epithelial signal transduction pathways, by means of newly developed and validated cytoplasmic and nuclear stainings for key transcription factors and kinases, demonstrated that exposure to diesel exhaust increased the nuclear translocation of redox sensitive signal transduction components including phosphorylated (p) -p 38 -MAPK, p-JNK, p-c-jun (AP- 1) and p 65 (NFκB). These findings indicate novel mechanistic aspects to be involved in the airway response to particulate air pollution. The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as phosphorylated C-terminal Tyr 1173 increased significantly following DE exposure. The findings are consistent with the upregulation of p 38 and JNK MAPkinases as well as increased NFκB expression. The MEK-ERK pathway was not affected and Src related phosphorylation was absent. Diesel exposure at urban <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> running conditions resulted in upregulation of the vascular adhesion molecule expression in the bronchial mucosa as signs of an early inflammatory response, while infiltration of inflammatory cells had not yet occurred. Differences in organic composition and particle concentration in the exhaust compared to idling situation may have influenced the outcome. This thesis has added a mechanistic basis for the diesel exhaust induced airway inflammation in-vivo in humans. It is concluded that activation of epithelial signal transduction pathways, cytokine production and increased endothelial adhesion molecule expression play important roles in the airway inflammatory response to diesel exhaust...|$|R
40|$|Since the Euro-ІІІ {{standard}} was adopted, the main methods to inhibit NOx production in diesel engines are {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) and select catalyst reduction (SCR). On these methods SCR offers great fuel economy, so it has received wide attention. However, there also exists a trade-off law between NOx conversion efficiency and NH 3 slip under dynamic conditions. To inhibit NH 3 slip with high NOx conversion efficiency, a dynamic control method for a urea water solution (UWS) injection was investigated. The variation phenomena of SCR conversion efficiency {{with respect to the}} cross-sensitivity characteristics of the NOx sensor to NH 3 have been thoroughly analyzed. The methodology of “uncertain conversion efficiency curve tangent analysis” has been applied to estimate the concentration of the slipped NH 3. The correction factor “φ” of UWS injection is obtained by a comparative calculation of the NOx conversion ability and subsequent NH 3 slip. It also includes methods of flow compensation and flow reduction. The proposed control method has been authenticated under dynamic conditions. In low frequency dynamic experiments, this control method has accurately justified the NH 3 slip process and inhibits the NH 3 emission to a lower level thereby improving the conversion efficiency to a value closer to the target value. The results of <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> (<b>ETC)</b> experiments indicate that NH 3 emissions are reduced by 90. 8 % and the emission level of NOx is close to the Euro-Ѵ standard...|$|R
40|$|A dosing {{strategy}} for the transient control of an exhaust after-treatment system using the NOX storage and reduction approach was developed on a heavy-duty diesel engine rig equipped with an 11 l diesel engine. The catalysts were oxidation catalysts of 8. 4 l and NOX storage and reduction catalysts of 16. 8 l total volume. The dosing strategy has been tested in a <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> (<b>ETC)</b> resulting in a NOX reduction of 60 % (by 4. 5 g/kWh) with a fuel penalty of 6. 6 % when the catalysts were preconditioned to 450 °C. The reducing agent was diesel fuel. To keep the fuel penalty low, a bypass system was used which bypassed approximately 90 % of the exhaust flow under the regeneration periods. The parameters for the dosing strategy were obtained from steady-state optimization experiments (constant speed and torque) using Design of Experiments (DoE) to obtain much information from few experiments. The system was optimized for {{a high degree of}} NOX reduction with a low fuel penalty. The period when the flow through the catalyst is reduced (bypass time), the cycle time, the injection time and rate are important parameters to achieve an improved NOX reduction. The optimal values of these parameters varied with the load points used. The steady-state NOX conversion was approximately 60 % (3. 3 – 4. 1 g/kWh) at catalyst temperatures between 330 and 530 °C. The most promising parameters for a large NOX reduction and a low fuel penalty have been applied in the dosing strategy and tested in an ETC...|$|R
40|$|Several {{principal}} aspects {{and components}} of an advanced catalytic exhaust after-treatment system for NO, reduction on a heavy-duty diesel truck engine have been systematically examined and evaluated. The after-treatment system consists of de-NO, catalysts, injection of a reducing agent (diesel fuel), and computer programs {{to model the}} engine and catalysts in real time. These models are combined with a third program, a strategy, to control the injection of reducing agent during transient operation. Evaluation of the system was performed using the standard <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> (<b>ETC).</b> The benefits and disadvantages of an oxidation catalyst upstream the reductant injection are clarified. Whereas an increased NO 2 /NO ratio is beneficial at larger reductant dosages, the effects of temperature levelling and delay are detrimental for system performance. The dynamic effect of introducing a strategy for distributing the reducing agent in time is elucidated. The strategy itself is presented {{and the process of}} its systematic optimisation is closely followed. Implications of the optimisation are that catalyst temperature is the most important variable in the strategy. Also, a considerable part of the reducing agent should be distributed at low and intermediate temperatures, for utilising an increased NO 2 /NO ratio. Furthermore, results suggest that a smooth, rather than instantaneous, adjustment of reductant dosage to driving conditions is necessary. Finally, a set-up with two injectors is examined for its potential in the application. It is shown to be of disadvantage for the ETC as a whole, but may not be so at lower exhaust gas flows...|$|R
40|$|A control {{structure}} is proposed and investigated for coordinatedcontrol of EGR valve and VGT position in heavy duty diesel engines. Main control goals are {{to fulfill the}} legislated emission levels, toreduce the fuel consumption, and to fulfill safe operation of theturbocharger. These goals are achieved through regulation ofnormalized oxygen/fuel ratio and intake manifoldEGR-fraction. These are chosen both as main performance variables andfeedback variables since they contain information about when it ispossible to decrease the fuel consumption by minimizing the pumpingwork. Based on this a novel and simple pumping work minimizationstrategy is developed. The proposed performance variables are also strongly coupled to theemissions which {{makes it easier to}} adjust set-points, e. g. dependingon measured emissions during an emission calibration process, since itis more straightforward than control of manifold pressure and air massflow. Further, internally the controller is structured to handle thedifferent control objectives. Controller tuning is important forperformance but can be time consuming and to meet this end a method isdeveloped where the controller objectives are captured in a costfunction, which makes automatic tuning possible even though objectivesare conflicting. Performance trade-offs are necessary and areillustrated on the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle.</b> The proposed controlleris validated in an engine test cell, where it is experimentallydemonstrated that the controller achieves all the control objectivesand that the current production controller has at least 26 % higherpumping losses compared to the proposed controller. © 2009 IEEE.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the toxicity (oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity) in extracts of combustion aerosols. A typical Euro III heavy truck engine was tested over the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> with three different fuels: conventional diesel EN 590, biodiesel EN 14214 as B 100 and blends with conventional diesel (B 5, B 10, and B 20) and pure plant oil DIN 51605 (PPO). In addition application of a (wall flow) diesel particulate filter (DPF) with conventional diesel EN 590 was tested. The use of B 100 or PPO as a fuel or the DPF reduced particulate matter (PM) mass and numbers over 80 %. Similarly, significant reduction in the emission of chemical constituents (EC 90 %, (oxy) -PAH 70 %) were achieved. No significant changes in nitro-PAH were observed. The use of B 100 or PPO led to a NOx increase of about 30 %, and no increase for DPF application. The effects of B 100, PPO and the DPF on the biological test results vary strongly from positive to negative depending on the biological end point. The oxidative potential, measured via the DTT assay, of the B 100 and PPO or DPF emissions is reduced by 95 %. The cytotoxicity is increased for B 100 by 200 %. The measured mutagenicity, using the Ames assay test with TA 98 and YG 1024 strains of Salmonella typhimurium indicate a dose response for the nitroarene sensitive YG 1024 strain for B 100 and PPO (fold induction: 1. 6). In summary B 100 and PPO have good potential for the use as a second generation biofuel resulting in lower PM mass, similar to application of a DPF, but caution should be made due to potential increased toxicity. Besides regulation via mass, the biological reactivity of exhaust emissions of new (bio) fuels and application of new technologies, needs attention. The different responses of different biological tests as well as differences in results between test laboratories underline the need for harmonization of test methods and international cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{negative}} effects of air pollution on morbidity and mortality have been known since the mid 20 th century. The two most well known examples are the Meuse Valley disaster in the 1930 ’ies and the London black fog in December 1952. Whilst there are numerous epidemiological studies, in which associations between morbidity and mortality {{and high levels of}} pollutants have been reported, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Two of the main air pollutants are particulate matter (PM) mostly emanating from diesel exhaust (DE), and ozone, both of which are highly oxidative. Exposure to DE has resulted in adverse effects both in the respiratory tract and in the cardiovascular system. High ozone levels have also been shown to be associated with increased admissions to hospital for respiratory as well as cardiovascular conditions. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of a combination of exposures to ozone and DE. DE generated during the urban part of the standardized <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> (<b>ETC)</b> was compared to DE generated by an idling engine. It was also evaluated whether an acute exposure to ozone would have any effects on the cardiovascular system as assessed by venous occlusion forearm plethysmography and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) was evaluated as a potential marker for acute exposure to ozone or DE. Methods: Four double-blind randomized cross-over exposure studies were conducted to investigate the effects of ozone and DE on both the respiratory tract and the vascular function in healthy volunteers. All of the exposures were performed in purposely built “walk-in” chambers with strictly controlled exposures. In the first study, the volunteers were exposed to DE (300 µg/m 3) generated by an idling engine or to air, for one hour in the morning and to ozone (200 ppb) for two hours in the afternoon. A bronchoscopy with bronchial wash (BW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 hours after the initial exposure. In study II and III, an assessment of vascular function using venous occlusion forearm plethysmography was performed after an exposure to DE (250 µg/m 3) generated under transient running conditions, compared to air exposure (study II) and ozone and air exposure (study III). HRV was assessed under a 24 hour period starting before each exposure (study III). In study IV, FENO measurements were conducted after DE and ozone exposures to investigate whether the previously established airway inflammation would be detectable by this non-invasive method. Results: DE exposure enhanced the established ozone-induced airway inflammation in terms of a pronounced neutrophilia in BW. DE generated under transient running conditions, impaired vascular function in healthy volunteers, whereas exposure to ozone did not. HRV were not altered by exposure to ozone. Exposure to DE caused a significant increase in FENO at the 10   (FENO 10) and 50 (FENO 50) mL/s flow rates at 6 hours post-exposure, but ozone exposure did not affect FENO at any flow rate or time point. Conclusion: We have tried to mimic real-life exposure to air pollutants. In the first study, an exposure to DE followed by an exposure to ozone in the afternoon resulted in an enhanced airway inflammation, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect, supporting the epidemiological findings of unfavorable effects of the combination of these two air pollutants. DE generated by an engine running at the urban part of the standardized <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> impaired two important and complementary aspects of vascular function, the regulation of vascular tone and endogenous fibrinolysis. This has previously been shown with DE generated at idling conditions. This suggests that the mechanisms behind the adverse effects {{can be found in the}} properties of the particles and not in the gaseous components. In these studies, exposure to ozone did not impair vascular function in healthy subjects, or cause any alterations in HRV. This suggests that the epidemiological evidence for an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality following acute exposure to ozone might not be totally accurate. Previous controlled exposure studies with ozone have not shown an airway inflammation affecting the endothelium, at least not in the same time-frame as following DE exposure. FENO could possibly be a useful tool for assessing airway inflammation caused by DE, whereas the powerful oxidant ozone did not affect FENO. This suggests that the airway inflammatory effects caused by these two pollutants are regulated via different mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Legislators {{steadily}} {{increase the}} demands on lowered emissions from heavy duty vehicles. To meet these demands {{it is necessary to}} integrate technologies like Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Variable Geometry Turbochargers (VGT) together with advanced control systems. A control structure with PID controllers and selectors is proposed and investigated for coordinated control of EGR valve and VGT position in heavy duty diesel engines. Main control goals are to fulfill the legislated emission levels, to reduce the fuel consumption, and to fulfill safe operation of the turbocharger. These goals are achieved through regulation of normalized oxygen/fuel ratio and intake manifold EGR-fraction. These are chosen as main performance variables since they are strongly coupled to the emissions, compared to manifold pressure or air mass flow, which makes it easy to adjust set-points depending on e. g. measured emissions during an emission calibration process. In addition a mechanism for fuel efficient operation is incorporated in the structure, this is achieved by minimizing the pumping work. To design a successful control structure, a mean value model of a diesel engine is developed and validated. The intended applications of the model are system analysis, simulation, and development of model-based control systems. Model equations and tuning methods for the model parameters are described for each subsystem in the model. Static and dynamic validations of the entire model show mean relative errors that are less than 12 %. Based on a system analysis of the model, a key characteristic behind the control structure is that oxygen/fuel ratio is controlled by the EGR-valve and EGR-fraction by the VGT-position, in order to handle a sign reversal in the system from VGT to oxygen/fuel ratio. For efficient calibration an automatic controller tuning method is developed. The controller objectives are captured in a cost function, that is evaluated utilizing a method choosing representative transients. The performance is evaluated on the <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle.</b> It is demonstrated how the weights in the cost function influence behavior, and that the tuning method is important in order to improve the control performance compared to if only a standard method is used. It is also demonstrated that the controller structure performs well regarding all control objectives. In combination with its efficient tuning, the controller structure thus fulfills all requirements for successful application. Report code: LiU-TEK-LIC- 2006 : 52...|$|R

40|$|Control and {{diagnosis}} of complex systems demand accurate knowledge of certain quantities {{to be able}} to control the system efficiently and also to detect small errors. Physical sensors are expensive and some quantities are hard or even impossible to measure with physical sensors. This has made model-based estimation an attractive alternative. Model-based estimators are sensitive to errors in the model and since the model complexity needs to be kept low, the accuracy of the models becomes limited. Further, modeling is hard and time consuming and it is desirable to design robust estimators based on existing models. An experimental investigation shows that the model deficiencies in engine applications often are stationary errors while the dynamics of the engine is well described by the model equations. This together with fairly frequent appearance of sensor offsets have led to a demand for systematic ways of handling stationary errors, also called bias, in both models and sensors. In the thesis systematic design methods for reducing bias in estimators are developed. The methods utilize a default model and measurement data. In the first method, a low order description of the model deficiencies is estimated from the default model and measurement data, resulting in an automatic model augmentation. The idea is then to use the augmented model for estimator design, yielding reduced stationary estimation errors compared to an estimator based on the default model. Three main results are: a characterization of possible model augmentations from observability perspectives, an analysis of what augmentations that are possible to estimate from measurement data, and a robustness analysis with respect to noise and model uncertainty. An important step is how the bias is modeled, and two ways of describing the bias are introduced. The first is a random walk and the second is a parameterization of the bias. The latter can be viewed {{as an extension of the}} first and utilizes a parameterized function that describes the bias as a function of the operating point of the system. The parameters, rather than the bias, are now modeled as random walks, which eliminates the trade-off between noise suppression in the parameter convergence and rapid change of the offset in transients. This is achieved by storing information about the bias in different operating points. A direct application for the parameterized bias is the adaptation algorithms that are commonly used in engine control systems. The methods are applied to measurement data from a heavy duty diesel engine. A first order model augmentation is found for a third order model and by modeling the bias as a random walk, an estimation error reduction of 50 % is achieved for a <b>European</b> <b>transient</b> <b>cycle.</b> By instead letting a parameterized function describe the bias, simulation results indicate similar, or better, improvements and increased robustness...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} modelling of heterogeneous catalytic {{systems is}} challenging {{due to the}} unknown nature of new catalytic materials {{as well as the}} often required transient nature of the resulting models. Thus, this thesis deals with the methodologies involved in the kinetic modelling of heterogeneous catalysis and in particular NOx reduction systems. The methods presented increase the understanding of the interplay between model parameters and also decrease the number of necessary laboratory experiments. The effect of more efficient parameter estimation methods should result in faster model development which is required in any process development but especially for catalytic emission control. In the first paper, injection parameters for an engine rig with a NOx Storage and Reduction (NSR) system were optimised using different experimental designs at different load points. The optimised settings were used as a map for a control strategy complying with a <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> (<b>ETC).</b> In the second paper, we developed a method that copes with the large number of unknown model parameters by applying a Latent Variable (LV) model to the Jacobian matrix in the fitting procedure. The LV model results in a low-dimensional approximation of the Jacobian with reduced parameter correlation and enables improved efficiency in parameter estimation. In the third paper, Experimental design for precise parameter estimation was performed in a batch-sequential way using D-optimality as the objective function. A screening methodology similar to that used for drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry was applied for a large number of simulated candidate experiments. By applying an LV model to the Jacobian of all these experiments, a reduced parameter correlation was obtained and the number of necessary experiments was reduced. The results from the second and third paper pinpoint a number of benefits of using LV models including: 1) 	the determination of the effective rank, i. e. the number of independent phenomena present in the data at hand, 2) 	the analysis of the correlation structure which is useful in the parameter assessment and 3) 	the linear approximation in few dimensions enables more efficient computations. In the fourth paper, a detailed model for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx using Hydrocarbon as a reducing agent (HC-SCR) over silver alumina (Ag-Al 2 O 3) was developed. By applying an experimental design to the steady state levels and also selecting the run order, improved fitting properties were obtained due to the increased parameter sensitivity enabled by the transient experiments. This thesis also contains a description of the modelling techniques and challenges encountered during this thesis project. An assessment of the importance as well as the parameter correlation is given. This demonstrates the intimate interplay between model assumptions and the stipulated model parameters and exemplifies a thorough assessment of the whole modelling chain from initial experiments to model validation...|$|R
40|$|The {{legislative}} {{limits for}} NOX {{emissions in the}} exhaust gas from heavy-duty diesel engines will be decreased in the European Union from today 3. 5 g/kWh (Euro IV) to 2. 0 g/kWh in 2008 (Euro V). In the USA and Japan a similar trend can be seen. Accordingly, {{the development of an}} exhaust aftertreatment system for heavy-duty trucks seems unavoidable. In this work, an 11 l diesel engine rig has been built up including an aftertreatment system which is based on the NOX storage and reduction approach. BaO-based NOX storage and reduction catalysts of in total 16. 8 l were used and also oxidation catalysts of in total 8. 4 l to oxidise NO to NO 2 and pre-oxidise the injected hydrocarbons. The NOX storage and reduction technology has already been applied in lean-burn gasoline vehicles and has shown NOX reduction degrees of 80 % and above. It is thus a promising alternative for the reduction of NOX in diesel truck exhausts. In the NOX storage and reduction concept, NOX is stored as Ba(NO 3) 2 under long lean periods (1 - 2 min) and released and reduced under short rich periods (0 - 10 s). It is the aim of this project to both optimise the aftertreatment system with respect to a high NOX reduction and a low fuel penalty and also create models of the catalysts which may be used to control the NOX reduction performance under transient conditions. Stationary NOX reduction experiments have been performed on the engine rig. The maximal degree of NOX reduction was approximately 60 % under stationary operation. The degree of NOX reduction depends on a number of parameters as the catalyst temperature, the injection time, the cycle time or the dosed amount of hydrocarbons (diesel fuel). To keep the fuel penalty low, a bypass system has been installed, which bypassed approximately 90 % of the exhaust flow under the regeneration periods. The period when the flow through the catalyst is reduced, the bypass time, {{has turned out to be}} an important parameter to achieve an improved low temperature NOX reduction without increasing the fuel penalty. An optimisation of the NOX reduction performance has been done at different temperatures using Design of Experiments. The optimisation results served as the base of a temperature dependent dosing strategy which controlled the injections under transient conditions. In a <b>European</b> <b>Transient</b> <b>Cycle</b> (<b>ETC),</b> a 60 % NOX conversion was achieved with a fuel penalty of 6. 6 %. A first model for the NOX storage and reduction catalyst has been developed and tested under stationary conditions. A mean-field model of the oxidation catalyst placed upstream of the NOX storage and reduction catalyst has also been created and tested successfully in an ETC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The suprachiasmatic nuclei of the {{hypothalamus}} {{contain the}} major cir-cadian pacemaker in mammals, driving circadian rhythms in behavioral and physiological functions. This circadian pacemaker’s responsiveness to light allows synchronization to the light-dark cycle. Phase shifting by light often involves several <b>transient</b> <b>cycles</b> {{in which the}} behavioral activity rhythm gradu-ally shifts to its steady-state position. In this article, the authors investigate in Syrian hamsters whether a phase-advancing light pulse results in immediate shifts of the PRC at the next circadian cycle. In a first series of experiments, the authors aimed a light pulse at CT 19 to induce a phase advance. It appeared that the steady-state phase advances were highly correlated with activity onset {{in the first and}} second <b>transient</b> <b>cycle.</b> This enabled them to make a reliable estimate of the steady-state phase shift induced by a phase-advancing light pulse on the basis of activity onset in the first <b>transient</b> <b>cycle.</b> In the next series of experiments, they presented a light pulse at CT 19, which was followed by a second light pulse aimed at the delay zone of the PRC on the next circadian cycle.

40|$|Rate-based Flow control {{plays an}} {{important}} role for efficient traffic management of ABR service in ATM networks. In this paper, a performance analysis of a rate-based flow control mechanism is presented. In our analytical model, the number of active sources is variable. A new source arrives when a connection is established, and an existing source departs when it has transmitted its data. Hence our model not only reflect the real scenes, but also correctly estimate the effect of the rate-based flow control. Due to this variation, the analysis of the steady state is not enough. Therefore the analysis of <b>transient</b> <b>cycles</b> is also developed. Using the results of both analyses, we derive the equations of cell loss probability and utilization.
