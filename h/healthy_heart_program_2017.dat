40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the most}} common cause of mortality in Iran. A six-year, comprehensive, integrated community-based demonstration study entitled Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP) conducted in Iran, and it started in 2000. Evaluation and monitoring are integrated parts of this quasi-experimental trial, and consists of process, as well as short and long-term impact evaluations. This paper presents the design of the "process evaluation" for IHHP, and the results pertaining to some interventional strategies that were implemented in workplaces Methods The process evaluation addresses the internal validity of IHHP by ascertaining the degree to which the program was implemented as intended. The IHHP process evaluation is a triangulated study conducted for all interventions at their respective venues. All interventional activities are monitored to determine why and how some are successful and sustainable, to identify mechanisms as well as barriers and facilitators of implementation. Results The results suggest that factory workers and managers are satisfied with the interventions. In the current study, success was mainly shaped by the organizational readiness and timing of the implementation. Integrating most of activities of the project to the existing ongoing activities of public health officers in worksites is suggested to be the most effective means of implementation of the health promoting activities in workplaces.

40|$|Background: There {{are several}} studies about the {{positive}} relation between physical inactivity or low cardio respiratory fitness with development of metabolic syndrome (MS). In contrast, physical activity had favourable effects on all components of MS but {{the quantity and}} the frequency of physical activity necessary to produce this beneficial effect has not been defined as yet. The aim of this survey was to study the association of regular physical activity, measured by patient′s estimation of walking time per day, with MS. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted as a part of Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP). Persons who had no component of MS were considered as reference group. Demographic data were collected by questionnaire. Relation between walking time and MS was evaluated by using logistic regression adjusted by age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), life style and food item. Results: The study populations consisted of 4151 persons. Lower physical activity was associated with higher prevalence of MS (P < 0. 001). There was a negative relation between the usual daily walking time and MS. Adjusted odds ratio for age groups, sex, SES, life style and food items (fat and oil, sweet and sweet drink, rice and bread, fried food) revealed that MS decreases with increasing walking time (P < 0. 05) [OR = 0. 70 (0. 52 - 0. 94) ].

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted {{as a part of the}} Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP). A total of 12492 individuals aged over 19 years, 6110 men and 6382 women entered the study. Definition of National Cholesterol Education Program was used to define MS. Sleep duration was reported by participants. Relation between sleep duration with MS was examined using categorical logistic regression in two models; unadjusted and adjusted for age and sex. Results: In our study, 23. 5 % of participants had MS. Compared with sleep duration of 7 - 8 hours per night; sleep duration of less than 5 hours was associated with a higher odds ratio for MS. This association remained significant even after adjustment for age and sex (OR: 1. 52; 95 %CI: 1. 33 - 1. 74).

This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} a healthy lifestyle community-based trial on salt intake and blood pressure among a representative sample of normotensive Iranian adults. Materials and Methods: We compared the data for salt intake, urinary sodium levels and blood pressure from three cross-sectional surveys in time points of 1999, 2001 - 2002 (beginning of the community interventions), and 2007 (after the community trial) for normotensive adult population of Isfahan, Iran in the framework of Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program.</b> Using multi-stage cluster sampling method, one of the family members at each household was randomly selected with Iranian adult population as a target. Dietary salt intake was estimated based on 24 hour urinary sodium levels. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured according to standard methods. Results: Dietary sodium intake and urinary sodium levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly decreased during the 9 -year study period. Unlike systolic and diastolic blood pressures that had a consistent decrement between 1999 and 2007, dietary sodium intake and urinary sodium levels were slightly raised from 1999 to 2000 - 2001 and then reduced between 2001 - 2 and 2007 evaluations. The same findings were reached when data were analyzed separately by gender or weight status.

40|$|Background: early {{diagnosis}} of left ventricular mass (LVM) inappropriateness and {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} (LVH) can result in preventing diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and its related morbidity and mortality. This study was performed to determine if diastolic dysfunction is associated with LVH and inappropriate LVM. Materials and Methods: one hundred and twenty five uncomplicated hypertension from Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> underwent two-dimensional echocardiography. Inappropriate LVM was defined as an LVM index greater than 88 g/m 2 of body-surface area in women and greater than 102 g/m 2 in men. LVH-defined septal and posterior wall thickness greater than 0 / 9 cm in women and greater than 1 cm in men, respectively. Echocardiographic parameters, including early diastolic peak velocity (E) /late diastolic peak velocity (A), deceleration time (DT), and E/early mitral annulus velocity (E′) were measured. Results: the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the patients′ admission day were 142. 87 ± 18. 12 and 88. 45 ± 9. 18 mmHg, respectively. Totally, 21. 7 % of subjects had inappropriate LV mass that moderate and severe abnormal LV mass was revealed in 5. 6 % and 5. 6 %, respectively. The mean of age and BMI was significantly higher in patients with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (P 0. 05). Spearman′s Rank {{test was used to}} test the correlation between diastolic dysfunction and LV mass (P = 0. 025). Conclusion: LVH is correlated with the severity of diastolic dysfunction manifested by the E/A value and deceleration time, but inappropriate LVM can slightly predict diastolic dysfunction severity in uncomplicated hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} regarding {{the relationship between}} dietary proteins intake and blood pressure (BP), but they had inconsistent results. Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to assess the association between different kinds of protein intake (animal and plant protein) and BP. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program.</b> We performed a cross-sectional study among 9660 randomly selected Iranian adults aged ≥ 19 -year-old that they were selected from three large Iranian regions in 2007. A simplified validated 48 -item-food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake including all kinds of protein. Systolic and diastolic BPs were measured in duplicate by trained personnel using a standard protocol. Multivariable regressions were applied to assess the relationship between protein intake and BP levels and the presence of hypertension (HTN). Results: More frequent consumption of animal, plant, and total protein intake were inversely associated with BP in a crude model (P < 0. 001); however, after adjustment for potential confounders this relationship remained only for plant protein (P = 0. 04). The risk of HTN occurrence decreased in the highest quintile of total and plant protein consumption by 19 % (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 81; confidence interval [CI]: [0. 65 – 0. 96]; P for trend = 0. 004) and 18 % (OR = 0. 82; [CI: (0. 67 – 0. 94]; P for trend = 0. 03), respectively.

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program.</b> Height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured by trained health-care professionals. MetS was defined as having three {{or more of the}} National Cholesterol Education Program III criteria. The relation between different age groups and different phenotypes of MetS was examined using the multinomial logistic regression. Results: We found low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) was the most common feature, followed by hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), abdominal obesity (ABO), hypertension (HTN), and high fasting blood glucose in decreasing order of prevalence. The most prevalent combination of MetS components was hypertrigeceridemia, low HDL-c and ABO (50. 7 %) in all subjects and especially in younger age group (63. 2 %). In elder age group, the most prevalent three components combination was HTG, Low HDL-c and HTN (43. 9 %). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elder subjects were at approximately 12 times higher risk of having the combination HTG, ABO, low HDL-c, and HTN (P < 0. 001) compared to the middle age subjects who had a lower risk for the same combination; (2 [1. 49 - 3. 49]) (P < 0. 001).

Methods: We used data from the post-intervention phase of Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP), a community trial for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and control. We recruited 9570 healthy adults, aged ≥ 19 years who were randomly selected using multistage random sampling method. World Health Organization QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) which contains 26 items {{was used to assess}} QoL. It assesses four domains of QoL; Physical health, Psychological health, Social relationship and Environmental issues. MetS was defined based on ATP III criteria. Results: The mean age of participants was 38. 8 ± 15. 6 years (mean ± SD) and the prevalence of MetS was 22. 5 %. From all participant 18. 2 % were illiterate and 13. 2 % had university educational level. Two way multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) test after adjusting age showed significant difference between women with and without Mets in regard to physical health and social relations domains, while none of QoL domains was different in men with Mets in comparison to men without it. Conclusions: After adjusting the role of socio-demographic factors as components of QoL score, no association was observed between QoL domains and MetS in men, while only social relations and physical health scores were higher in women with Mets compared to those without Mets. Other variety of health-related QoL assessment tools or definitions of MetS may show different relationship in the Iranian socio-cultural context...|$|R
40|$|Background. Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS) {{and psychological}} distress are hypothesized {{to have a}} bidirectional relationship. According to their high prevalence in most populations, appraisal of this theory would be of great clinical and research interest. Methods. Data were available {{as part of the}} Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP). A total of 9553 men and women aged ≥ 19 years from three counties in central Iran were selected. Measurements consisted of serologic tests, anthropometrics, and self-reported 12 -item general health questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the association between MetS, MetS components, and distress level. Results. The mean age of 9553 participants (50 % male) was 38. 7 ± 15. 8 years. After adjusting for demographic factors, MetS (OR = 1. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 37), central obesity (OR = 1. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 15 – 1. 49), and hypertension (OR = 1. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 42 – 1. 70) were associated with high distress level. However, after adding smoking status and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to the adjustment factors, hypertension (OR = 1. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 53 – 1. 98) and central obesity (OR = 1. 41, 95 % CI: 1. 17 – 1. 55), but not the MetS, remained significantly associated with distress level. Conclusion. The presence of association between the MetS as well as its key components and high distress level signifies the importance of integrating psychological assessment and intervention in the standard management of MetS patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{cluster of}} risk factors for {{cardiovascular}} diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occur together more often than by chance alone, have been known as the metabolic syndrome. Various definitions have been proposed by different organizations over the past decade. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate a new definition of the metabolic syndrome for the prediction of diabetes mellitus among the Iranian population. Methods: This study was carried out in an urban population, aged 20 to 74 years, from Yazd, a city in the center of Iran. The study {{is a part of the}} phase I of Yazd <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program,</b> that is, a community-based intervention study for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The significance level has been defined as P< 0. 05. Results: Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria was 21. 3 ±. 017 %, and by International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria it was 30. 16 ±. 02 %. The multivariate analysis showed that the most important relevant factors of diabetes mellitus were: Increased age and metabolic syndrome by both definitions of NCEP and IDF criteria, and also, the most important relevant factors of stable angina were: Increased age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome by only IDF definitions, but the NCEP definition of the metabolic syndrome cannot predict diabetes mellitus independent of age and sex. Conclusion: This study showed that increased age and metabolic syndrome are the most important relevant factors for diabetes mellitus, especially by using the IDF criteria for definition of the metabolic syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) and its risk factors increase after menopause, thus realizing {{that the effect of}} menopause on women's health is becoming ever more vital. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the menopausal effect on cardiovascular risk factors in elevated triglycerides (TG) and waist circumference (WC) phenotype, and to compare this phenotype among pre- and postmenopausal women. Method: A total of 4146 women were randomly selected for this study from three districts of Isfahan, Arak, and Najafabad in Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP). Anthropometric, physical, and biochemical factors were assessed using standard methods. All variables were studied based on the menopause status and the levels of TG and WC. Results: Twenty-five point three percent of the postmenopausal women and 9. 5 % of the pre-menopausal women were hyper-TG/WC phenotype; however, the highest percent (77. 1 %) belonged to high-WC women in the postmenopausal group. In comparison with the postmenopausal women, the premenopausal women were more physically active, with higher education level, but lower BMI, WC, waist to hip ratio, and less likely to be smoker. In postmenopausal women, biochemical factors including fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles were significantly higher than the premenopausal women. There was no significant difference for multivariate-adjusted means of cardiovascular risk factors for menopause in different phenotypes of the WC and TG groups after adjustment for age and BMI. Conclusion: Hyper- TG/WC phenotype was more prevalent in postmenopausal women and menopause is not independently associated with CVD risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient sleep {{may lead}} to adverse cardio-metabolic effects by {{influencing}} body weight, blood pressure, and glucose toler-ance. We aimed to assess the relation between sleep duration and indices of obesity including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a sample population in central Iran. We selected a sub-sample of 1770 individuals from Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program.</b> The data regarding the sleep duration was col-lected by using a validated questionnaire. The relation of sleep duration with BMI and waist circumference was examined by using categorical logistic regression with adjustment for sex, BMI, and daily calorie intake. Sleep duration time less than 5 hours/day compared with 7 - 8 hours/day increased the odds ratio for abdominal obesity in people aged under 60 years [OR= 2. 49 (95 %CI 1. 40 - 4. 43) ]. In individuals aged under 60 years, this relation was significant for both men, [OR= 2. 64 (95 %CI 1. 16 - 6. 02]) and women [OR= 2. 38 (95 % CI 1. 05 - 5. 39) ]. In addition, in women, sleep time> 9 hours was negatively related to waist circumference. Sleep duration time less than 5 hours per day increased odds ratio of overweight only in women [OR= 1. 75 (95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 85) ]. Sleep duration time under 5 hours in peo-ple aged less than 60 years was positively associated with waist circumference. In women, sleep duration time over 9 hours was negatively associated with waist circumference. Only in women, sleep time under 5 hours /night increased BMI. Short sleep dura-tion was associated with abdominal obesity and this was inde-pendent of its relation to BMI...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} Isfahan <b>Healthy</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Program</b> (IHHP) interventions concerning healthy behavior, on the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in the Iranian population. Materials and Methods: The IHHP targeted the population at large in three districts in central Iran from 2000 to 2007. Numerous interventional activities were performed to improve lifestyle. The main intervention strategies were public education through mass media, intersectional cooperation, health professional education, marketing and organizational development, legislation and policy development, as well as research and evaluation. MetS was defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III definition. The logistic regression method was applied to explore the relationship between lifestyle factors with components of metabolic risk factors. Results: The mean age of the participants was 44. 68 ± 14. 43 years in 2001. The mean values of the MetS components differed from 2001 to 2007. The mean of systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 126. 7 ± 22. 31 to 124. 21 ± 20. 0 and from 129. 47 ± 23. 08 to 126. 26 ± 21. 88 among females in both the intervention and reference areas. Similar changes were observed among males. The mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and triglycerides decreased significantly in the intervention area and increased significantly in the reference area in both sexes. High density protein cholesterol (HDL-C) was decreased in both sexes, from 2001 to 2007, in both areas. A strong relationship between tobacco control with high SBP and hypertriglyceridemia was found (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: Lifestyle improvement programs could be useful to improve the MetS status among men and women...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{epidemiological}} characteristics of hypertensive patients in urban population of Yazd, A cen­tral city in Iran. Methods: This cross sectional {{study was conducted}} from 2005 - 2006 and carried out on population aging 20 - 74 years. It {{is a part of}} the phase I of Yazd <b>healthy</b> <b>heart</b> <b>program</b> that it is a community interventional study for prevention of car­diovascular disease. Data obtained from questionnaires were analyzed by SPSS version 13. P value less than 0. 05 were consid­ered significant level. Results: This study comprised of 2000 participants that 847 (42. 5 %) were diagnosed as being hypertensive. After age ad­justment, prevalence of hypertension was 25. 6 % (23. 3 % for women and 27. 5 % for men (P< 0. 001). Age, Total cho­lesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, body mass index and waist were significantly higher in the hypertensive groups. 53. 7 % of hypertensive cases were aware of own condition, 45 % were treated, and 33. 9 % of treated were controlled (30. 7 % and 35. 4 % in men and women re­spectively). In other word, 24 % of all hypertensives (aware or unaware about own blood pressure condition) were treated and only 8 % of them were controlled. Men significantly had less awareness (P< 0. 001), lower tendency to take medi­cation (P< 0. 001), and less were controlled (P= 0. 046). Conclusion: We understand high prevalence, low awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension and higher preva­lence of other traditional metabolic risk factors in these cases. It seems that urgent preventional studies should be con­ducted in this population...|$|R
