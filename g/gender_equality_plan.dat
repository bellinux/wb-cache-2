40|$|This {{study by}} the <b>Gender</b> <b>Equality</b> Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean {{presents}} a review {{and analysis of the}} processes of drawing up the <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> <b>plans</b> now in place in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Since they were first developed in the 1990 s and, more particularly, in the twenty-first century, these plans have become real road maps towards <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> and guaranteeing the rights of women for States in the region, as well {{as a sign of the}} political will to make progress in this area. Analysis of the processes by which these plans were prepared identifies aspects that could improve their scope and impact, both in terms of ending the subordination of women and tackling discrimination against them, and in relation to the need to mainstream the gender perspective in public policies. Today, Latin American and Caribbean countries face numerous and complex challenges in the area of <b>gender</b> <b>equality,</b> which require the sustained and cross-cutting commitment of the State to women’s human rights and autonomy. The region has a Regional Gender Agenda that must form part of the discussion in relation to future <b>equality</b> <b>plans</b> and that, together with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, constitutes a frame of reference for proposals and goals. Lastly, as described in this study, the creation and linking of synergies between <b>equality</b> <b>plans</b> and development planning instruments is both an imperative and an opportunity. An imperative, because development is not possible without <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> And an opportunity, because it opens the way for establishing and strengthening an institutional architecture for equality, democracy and development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine how <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> {{can be used in}} the workplace, its {{possible}} effects, and what collaboration can contribute to the subject of <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> A combination of legal sociological and legal dogmatic methodology has been used to examine the EU and Swedish law, how equality should be approached and what previous studies have concluded. An interview has been conducted to provide a clearer picture of how <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> appears in practice, in the modern workplace.   An <b>equality</b> <b>plan</b> should be conducted every three years and applies to employers who are responsible for more than 25 employees. The manual should include a description of the measures considered necessary in the workplace in order to promote <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> How an <b>equality</b> <b>plan</b> should be developed is not specifically outlined in the current law, and thus this is left up to the employer to determine. The <b>equality</b> <b>plan</b> should be drawn up in collaboration with the employees, and usually in the presence of their union representatives.   According to current studies the general workforce has seen {{an increase in the number}} of <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> <b>plans</b> carried out, since the Equality Act was established, however few correctional measures are implemented. It has also proven difficult for employers to see any immediate effects of implementing these measures. One of the reasons for this may be that employers do not need to act on the measures outlined in their <b>equality</b> <b>plans,</b> but solely identify the measures deemed necessary. Similarly, studies and the interview conducted revealed that cooperation regarding <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in many cases is limited.     A new investigation has suggested a more significant change in discrimination law, whereby the <b>equality</b> <b>plan</b> is replaced with systematic work on active measures. This systematic work seeks to clarify the legislation and make equality work a more liquid process that is continually evaluated and improved upon. Furthermore this approach aims to make active participation in equality promotion an obligation in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nordic {{collaboration}} in issues of <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> {{has a history}} spanning four decades. In recent years, the issue of <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in schools and preschools has received extensive attention. The reasons for this attention are one, {{that the development of}} Nordic societies has caused pressure to update <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> laws to bring about equality and equity in schools; and two, that boys have begun to fall behind girls’ achievements academically in many western countries, drawing attention again to gender issues. Changes in legislation create pressure for educational professionals to develop their practices. However, gender-equality promotion practices vary considerably between Nordic countries and between regions of single countries. In this project, funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers, participants gathered and compared data on current ‘promising practices’ relating to <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> promotion at schools and kindergartens in each Nordic country. This project identified the following as the most promising practices for furthering <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in education: one; gender mainstreaming in education, both in teaching and learning; two, <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> <b>planning</b> at schools (GEP); three, recruiting <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> educators to municipalities; four, creating a national or a Nordic gender-equality certificate for educational institutions to acquire; five, promoting gender balance and diversity among educational staff; and six, <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> work with the parents of students. Each practice is itself an influential activity; together, these six practices present a systematic approach {{to the development of the}} organisation of education, and a comprehensive strategy for promoting <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in education. This project report aims to contribute discussion on the issues, ‘Can one speak of a ‘Nordic equality model’ in education?’ and, ‘How can Nordic countries benefit from a joint <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> promotion?’ and ‘Can Nordic <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> promotion be beneficial for non-European countries?...|$|R

By taking into account the organisations, but also their broader national context, this project aims to develop and maintain research potential and skills of both, women and men researchers, in order to sustain the quality of their working conditions. Particular attention is given to the early stages of academic and scientific career, which are usually little considered in <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> <b>plans,</b> even though the current recruitment practices within Academy make wide use of non-tenure track positions. These unstable career perspectives occur at a life stage in which important choices are made in private life, particularly for women. Moreover, creativity and autonomy – fundamental conditions to achieve original and meaningful research – are necessarily affected by the high instability of their professional life. The project concentrates on both, STEM and SSH disciplines. The main aim shall be to achieve substantive equality between men and women in academic careers, at all levels, starting from the achievement of the PhD.

40|$|Sweden {{possess the}} forth {{place as the}} most gender equal {{country in the world}} (World Economic Forum, 2013). But when it comes to women in higher-level {{positions}}, Sweden ends up below the European mean (European Commission, Justice, 2011). How can this be? And more importantly, how can Sweden work to attain <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in higher-level positions in the future? Why this gap exists in Sweden and how to reduce it is in need of further investigation and research. The thesis aims to investigate why men keep dominating higher- level positions within organisations in Sweden. A focus has been put on municipalities and their extensive work for <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> The thesis will address the extensive work Swedish municipalities have done within <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> and why they are relatively equal when it comes to <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in higher- level positions. Further on it will provide a general understanding of their successful work and how it can be useful in other organisations. Additionally, it will be investigated how this extensive <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> work, with a primary focus on <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> policies and <b>plans,</b> and other regulations can help women reach and keep the higher-level positions in an organisation. A qualitative research approach has been used for this research. The primary data was collected through in-depth semi- structured interviews with five Swedish municipalities. The data was later analysed through qualitative data analysis. In conclusion, the most successful factors to include when working towards a gender equal workplace and encouraging more females to aim for higher-level positions are extensive work with <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> policies and <b>plans,</b> including changes in the recruitment process together with providing options of how to allocate your working hours. This to open up for equal opportunities, excluding gender based prejudices, for those individuals who have the right competence and are interested in possessing a higher-level position in an organisation. ...|$|R

Through their activities, transnational corporations also have impacts on national and cultural gender relations, thus highlighting that gender relations are indeed amenable, to some extent, to social change. Accordingly, large transnational corporations have many effects and implications for gender relations in society, as well as having their own gender relations within them, characteristically {{in the form of}} men’s far greater presence in management than women’s. A key aspect in the functioning of transnational corporations is thus the way they organise and restructure gender relations within their own activities. The research presented here on gender divisions and gender policies in largest Finnish multinational and national corporations is part of a longer-term examination of the relations of gender relations in transnational corporations. It sets out the results of a survey of the largest 100 Finnish corporations with regard to the following main kinds of question: · general information on the corporation’s size, sector and economic activities; · the gender composition of their employment, middle management, top management, and board; · their <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> <b>plans</b> and related policies.

The institutionalization of the gender perspective in Ministries of Labor is emerging as a highly effective tool for designing <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> policies, <b>plans</b> and programs. This reflection about different experiences in the region––and the strengths and weaknesses they evince––provides an orientation framework for future actions.

40|$|Background: All European {{countries}} need {{to increase}} the number of health professionals in the near future. Most efforts have not brought the expected results so far. The current notion is that this is mainly related to the fact that female physicians will clearly outnumber their male colleagues within a few years in nearly all European countries. Still, women are underrepresented in leadership and research positions throughout Europe. Objectives: The MedGoFem project addresses multiple perspectives with the participation of multiple stakeholders. The goal is to facilitate the implementation of <b>Gender</b> <b>Equality</b> <b>Plans</b> (GEP) in university hospitals; thereby, transforming the working conditions for women working as researchers and highly qualified physicians simultaneously. Our proposed innovation, a crosscutting topic in all research and clinical activities, must become an essential part of university hospital strategic concepts. Methods: We capture the current status with gender-sensitive demographic data concerning medical staff and conduct Web-based surveys to identify cultural, country-specific, and interdisciplinary factors conducive to women’s academic success. Individual expectations of employees regarding job satisfaction and working conditions will be visualized based on “personal construct theory” through repertory grids. An expert board working out scenarios and a gender topic agenda will identify culture-, nation-, and discipline-specific aspects of <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> University hospitals in 7 countries will establish consensus groups, which work on related topics. Hospital management supports the consensus groups, valuates group results, and shares discussion results and suggested measures across groups. Central findings of the consensus groups will be prepared as exemplary case studies for academic teaching on research and work organization, leadership, and management. Results: A discussion group on <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in academic medicine will be established on an internationally renowned open-research platform. Project results will be published in peer-reviewed journals with high-impact factors. In addition, workshops on gender dimension in research using the principles of Gendered Innovation will be held. Support and consulting services for hospitals will be introduced in order to develop a European consulting service. Conclusions: The main impact of the project will be the implementation of innovative GEP tailored to the needs of university hospitals, which will lead to measurable institutional change in <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> This will impact the research at university hospitals in general, and will improve career prospects of female researchers in particular. Simultaneously, the gender dimension in medical research as an innovation factor and mandatory topic will be strengthened and integrated in each individual university hospital research activity. Research funding organizations can use the built knowledge to include mandatory topics for funding applications to enforce the use and implementation of GEP in university hospitals...|$|R

40|$|That {{women and}} men have {{different}} travel patterns {{has been known for}} a long time, and previous research argues that gender inequality is the reason for the different travel patterns. Thus, integrating a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective into transportation planning has been a relevant topic for quite some time. However, it has been proven to be easier said than done. <b>Gender</b> <b>equality</b> has not been given much attention within transportation planning and planners find it difficult to know how to implement a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective. By studying two County Transportation Plans developed by regions in northern Sweden and interviewing infrastructural planners as well as <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> experts, this thesis will investigate how <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> is managed and integrated in transport planning on a regional level, and how it could be integrated. How <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> relates to sustainable transportation on a regional level is another research question. The results show that the planners are aware of women’s and men’s different travel patterns, but they have experienced the difficulties of how <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> can be integrated in the plans, and integration has previously been made with modesty. This is partly due to lack of competence among the planners and because it has not been prioritized. The result also indicates that <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> can be beneficial for sustainable transportation, but some goal conflicts were found as well. A conclusion it that there seems to exist a paradox among the respondents where they are unsure of if the transportation should adjust to the current travel needs, or promote change. It is seemingly not either the lack of competence that is the reason <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> has not been prioritized, but the fact that other areas, such as the need of functional connections due to long distances between places has been seen as more important. The competence and knowledge exists, but need to increase among the planners, and <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> within transportation <b>planning</b> has to be given more attention on a national level and in the directives from the government. ...|$|R

To support the <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> action <b>plan</b> at one School of Medicine, this study sought to (1) identify the range of viewpoints held by staff on how to address gender inequality and (2) identify attitudinal barriers to change. Design: Q methodology. 50 potential interventions representing good practice or positive action, and addressing cultural, organisational and individual barriers to <b>gender</b> <b>equality,</b> were ranked by participants according to their perception of priority. Setting: The School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, UK. Participants: Fifty-five staff members were purposively sampled to represent gender and academic pay grade. Results: Principal components analysis identified six competing viewpoints on how to address gender inequality. Four viewpoints favoured positive action interventions: (1) support careers of women with childcare commitments, (2) support progression of women into leadership roles rather than focus on women with children, (3) support careers of all women rather than just those aiming for leadership, and (4) drive change via high-level financial and strategic initiatives. Two viewpoints favoured good practice with no specific focus on women by (5) recognising merit irrespective of gender and (6) improving existing career development practice. No viewpoint was strongly associated with gender, pay grade or role; however, latent class analysis identified that female staff {{were more likely than}} male to prioritise the setting of equality targets.

And, Whatchallenges do organizations face when practicing CSR focusing on the statutory equalityplan and <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> policies? It was found that the service industry practice CSR focusing on <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> well on amanagerial level. However, it was clear that the plan and policies were not strategicallycommunicated to the employees. Moreover, the employee surveys did not capture genderequality or workforce diversity. The findings of the manufacturing industry showed thatthey have several routines and strategies for how they should communicate and practice CSR focusing on workforce diversity. They have yearly employee surveys within thesubject as well as a booklet of organizational values, which is given out to all newemployees. Several challenges were discovered and brought up by the interviewees. One ofthem being preconceptions of the industry. It was clear that both the service and themanufacturing industry suffered from this as people tend to have preconceptions of theservice industry being simple and the manufacturing being tough and dirty. Futureresearchers are suggested to study workforce diversity separately, looking at the differentaspects to enable a more thorough understanding.

It {{is based on the}} results of the EU 5 th Framework project 'Enlargement, Gender & Governance: The Civic & Political Participation of Women in the EU Candidate Countries'. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews with women politicians & activists, the article mainly describes gender mainstreaming as implemented through 'transversal' action <b>plans</b> for <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> These action <b>plans</b> assign responsibility to different units for the delivery of different objectives. The author points out that 'transversalism' involves no necessary change in policy-making structures or practice, & argues that gender mainstreaming continues to be designated as a distinct or separate policy space in Lithuania. The author also notes that the absence of a stable commitment to gender mainstreaming & the general policy culture of Lithuania are not conducive the evaluation & impact assessment activities in this area...|$|R

40|$|Mainstreaming {{gender is}} a main concept gaining {{importance}} in the present century whose {{ultimate goal is to}} achieve <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> through <b>planned</b> action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. But because of the patriarchal nature of the society, the objectives of mainstreaming gender seem to be far away. Kate Millet in Sexual Politics (1970) sees through the game of patriarchal politics that the sexual domination is the most pervasive ideology and fundamental concept of power. The sexual politics of patriarchy situates man as the sovereign subject while a woman is required to find her total fulfillment in submissive drudgery. Male bias has been spread in the culture {{to such an extent that}} women never have a chance to see themselves through their own eyes as individuals. Mary Wollstonecraft as early as in 1792 in her A Vindication of the Rights of Women pleaded that women were not endowed with less intellect than men and therefore women‟s suppression was uncalled for and unjust. John Stuart Mill‟s famous essay The Subjection of Women (1860) generated much heat all over the world. It became almost a manifesto for the feminists. In India, too the double standards of males are quite common. On the surface level women are called „goddesses ‟ and „devis ‟ and underneath are hidden their mal motives. Suppression, oppression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Men {{and women}} have {{different}} patterns of health. These differences between the sexes present {{a challenge to the}} field of public health. The question why women experience more health problems than men despite their longevity has been discussed extensively, with both social and biological theories being offered as plausible explanations. In this article, we focus on how <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> in a partnership might be associated with the respondents' perceptions of health. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey with 1400 respondents. We measured <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> using two different measures: 1) a self-reported <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> index, and 2) a self-perceived <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> question. The aim of comparison of the self-reported <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> index with the self-perceived <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> question was to reveal possible disagreements between the normative discourse on <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> and daily practice in couple relationships. We then evaluated the association with health, measured as self-rated health (SRH). With SRH dichotomized into 'good' and 'poor', logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with the outcome. For the comparison between the self-reported <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> index and self-perceived <b>gender</b> <b>equality,</b> kappa statistics were used. Results: Associations between <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> and health found in this study vary with the type of <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> measurement. Overall, we found little agreement between the self-reported <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> index and self-perceived <b>gender</b> <b>equality.</b> Further, the patterns of agreement between self-perceived and self-reported <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> were quite different for men and women: men perceived greater <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> than they reported in the index, while women perceived less <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> than they reported. The associations to health were depending on <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> measurement used. Conclusions: Men and women perceive and report <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> differently. This means that it is necessary not only to be conscious of the methods and measurements used to quantify men's and women's opinions of <b>gender</b> <b>equality,</b> but also {{to be aware of the}} implications for health outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Local {{authorities}} {{of the city}} of Bergen and the county of Hordaland have cooperated in a pilot project: To adjust services to women and men – developing methods for better user contentment. The aim of the project has been to explore and further develop a method for incorporating a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective in the planning and production of public services. The project represents a novel approach, by directing <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> work towards the users of services. Seven workplaces have tried the 3 R-method to work systematic to incorporate a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective in the production of services. The Stein Rokkan Centre for Social Studies was engaged to follow the project; to guide the participants in the process, to evaluate, and to formulate the knowledge produced {{in such a way that}} other institutions could easily utilize it. The main product of this work has been a Guide to incorporate a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective, together with a workbook. This paper presents the evaluation forming the basis of the Guide. Through a description and discussion of the processes in the project, we give concrete recommendations on how one should organize and plan to work with the 3 Rmethod. Projects of this kind need to be solidly rooted in management. Other important conditions are clear structures in the project organisation, training in gender perspective and concrete and understandable tools. It is tremendously important that the local projects are planned with due regard to available time and resources. The local projects also indicate that it is easier to discover differences in how an institution complies to women and men by focusing thoroughly on a limited activity, than by mapping a larger part of it on the surface. For the project to have lasting consequences it will be favourable to connect it to main tasks in the organisation and to other development processes at the work place. The local projects had varying degrees of problems concretising the method and structuring their work. As an answer to this we developed a workbook in connection with preparation of the Guide. The workbook is meant to follow a local project from beginning to end and function as an exercise book, a work scheme and basis for a report. The evaluation concludes that this methodology can be an important tool for incorporating a <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> perspective in <b>planning</b> and production of regional services. It starts a process of increasing awareness of the activity according to <b>gender</b> <b>equality</b> and individual users. In this way the work offers an important contribution to quality development in the public sector...|$|R
