40|$|This paper {{describes}} a surgical technique to achieve root coverage in deep, wide <b>gingival</b> recessions <b>using</b> a root isolation procedure with ePTFE membrane, combined with tetracycline conditioning {{of the root}} surface and fibrin-fibronectin sealing system application. The technique was used on 15 patients with isolated mucogingival defects 4 to 6 mm deep. A large trapezium-shaped flap was raised 3 to 4 mm apical to {{the margin of the}} bone dehiscence. The root surface was thoroughly scaled by hand and rotating instruments. Tetracycline HCl solution (100 mg/ml) was topically applied for 4 minutes. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane was adapted at least 1 mm coronal to the CEJ and retained in position by sling sutures. A film of fibrin-fibronectin sealing system was injected between the membrane and the root surface. The flap was sutured coronally and the membrane removed 6 weeks later. The patients were reevaluated 6 months after the reentry procedure. The mean recession depth decreased from 4. 7 mm initially to 1. 1 mm at the final postoperative appointment. This represents a mean root coverage of 77. 4 %. Mean probing depth reduction was 0. 9 mm and the mean width of keratinized tissue increased from 1. 8 mm preoperatively to 2. 9 mm 6 months after surgery. These findings show that the treatment of buccal <b>gingival</b> recession <b>using</b> guided tissue regeneration procedure plus tetracycline root demineralization and fibrin-fibronectin glue application results in a consistent and predictable improvement of mucogingival defects...|$|R

30|$|Gingival {{recession}} is measured clinically as {{the distance from}} the cemento-enamel junction to the depth of the free <b>gingival</b> margin <b>using</b> the millimeter markings on the periodontal probe and reflects exposure of the root cementum [7, 8]. While this clinical recession measurement is useful in following the progression of gingival recession, it has two shortcomings. First, it is semi-quantitative with precision to 0.5 to 1.0  mm. Second, it is not an accurate assessment of the apical migration of the gingival margin due to its reliance on the cemento-enamel junction as a reference point. Given that the gingival margin’s physiological position may be 0.5 to 2.0  mm coronal to the cemento-enamel junction [7, 8], the reference point for clinical {{recession is}} obscured by the gingiva itself. Thus, the early stages of gingival recession prior to exposure of the cementum—defined in this paper as prodromal recession—might go undiagnosed.|$|R

40|$|Techniques {{to analyze}} the host immune {{response}} elicited {{by the presence of}} oral microorganisms and their products are central {{to our understanding of the}} local and systemic effects of oral diseases.

Material and methods: Patients showing at least one buccal gingival recession were recruited by one operator. Three recession types (RT) were identified. The classification was tested by two examiners blinded to the data collected by the other examiner. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreement was assessed. Furthermore, the 6 -month root coverage outcomes of consecutively treated gingival recessions were retrospectively evaluated to explore predictive value of the proposed classification on the final outcomes.

A total of 127 school {{children in the}} age range of 9 - 12 years from Barru Regency were {{included in this study}} as a sample of simple random sampling. Nutritional status of children (BMI index), degree of <b>gingival</b> inflammation (<b>using</b> chi-square test statistic), and missing teeth (DMF-T index) were recorded.

Children, who severe underweight, had higher odds for moderate caries (38. 2 %) than others group of who has an ideal weight, had moderate caries (18. 8 %). Based on chi-square test, there are correlation of nutritional status and dental caries severity (p= 0. 000 <p= 0. 05). There is a relationship of nutritional status with gingivitis and dental caries severity among a school children...|$|R
