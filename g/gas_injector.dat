40|$|Experimental tests {{previously}} {{executed by}} the authors on the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and gaseous fuel in a spark ignition engine revealed the presence of strong nonlinearities in {{the lower part of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> flow chart. These nonlinearities arise via the injector outflow area variation caused by the needle impacts and bounces during the transient phenomena that take place in the opening and closing phases of the injector and may seriously compromise the air-fuel mixture quality control for the lower injection times, thus increasing both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Despite the extensive literature about the operation and modelling of fuel injectors, there are no known studies focused on the nonlinearities of the <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> flow chart and on the way they can be reduced or eliminated. The authors thus developed a mathematical model for the prediction of mass injected by a spark ignition (S. I.) engine <b>gas</b> <b>injector,</b> validated through experimental data. The <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> has been studied with particular reference to the complex needle motion during the opening and closing phases, which may strongly affect the amount of fuel injected. In this work, the mathematical model previously developed has been employed to study and determine an appropriate injection strategy in order to linearize the injector flow chart to the greatest degree possible. The injection strategy proposed by the authors is based on minimum injection energy considerations and may be easily implemented in current engine control units (ECU) without any hardware modification or additional costs. Once calibrated by means of simulation, this strategy has been validated by experimental data acquired on an appropriately equipped injector test bench. As a result, the real injector flow chart has been substantially improved, reducing its deviation from linearity to one third of the original flow chart, which is an excellent result, especially if the typical measurement dispersion of the injected mass is taken into account. The injection strategy proposed by the authors could extend the linear behaviour of gas injectors and improve the fuel supply by means of a simple software update of the ECU, thus obtaining higher engine efficiency and lower pollutant emissions...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{plasma etching}} in silicon is {{often based on}} the {{so-called}} ‘Bosch’ etch with alternating half-cycles of a directional Si-etch and a fluorocarbon polymer passivation, respectively. Also shallow feature etching is often performed as a cycled process. Similarly, ALD is cyclic with the additional benefit of being composed of half-reactions that are self-limiting, thus enabling a layer-by-layer growth mode. To accelerate growth rate, spatial ALD has been commercialized as a large-scale, high-throughput, atmospheric-pressure method. In this paper we describe a related concept for high-rate spatially-divided etching which eventually may be further developed towards Atomic Layer Etching. The process is converted from the time-separated into the spatially-separated regime by inserting N 2 -gas ‘curtains’ confining the reactive gases to individual injection slots in a <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> head, and also serving as gas-bearing. By moving substrates back and forth under such <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> one can perform alternate etching/passivation-deposition cycles at optimized local pressures, thus eliminating the idle times for switching pressure or purging. An extra improvement towards an all-spatial approach {{is the use of}} ALD-based oxide (Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, etc.) as passivation during, or as gap-fill after etching. This disruptive concept, named spatial ALD-enabled RIE, has industrial potential for cost-effective front-end-of-line and back-end-of-line processing, especially in patterning structures requiring minimum interface, line edge and fin sidewall roughness (atomic-scale fidelity with selective removal of atoms and retention of sharp corners).

40|$|The diluted {{combustion}} (called also flameless oxidation) {{has been}} already applied in furnaces technology {{to get high}} process thermal efficiency with low NOx emissions. The principle {{of this type of}} combustion consists in providing a high level of dilution of the reactants with flue gases before combustion reaction occurs, to get a slower reaction in a much larger volume than in classical combustion. The resulting lower local heat release leads to a more homogeneous temperature field in the furnace, without peak values responsible of high thermal NOx formation. There are two requirements for working in diluted combustion: the dilution level of reactants by the flue gases has to be high enough and the temperature level in the combustion chamber has to be above a threshold (the auto-ignition temperature of the mixture). The aim of this work is to assess the technical feasibility and highlight the specific problems of application of diluted combustion in a medium scale boiler. The main difficulty is due to the high geometrical confinement and heat losses of a typical boiler combustion chamber. That prevents from getting the minimum level of reactants dilution and temperature needed to reach diluted combustion regime. The idea is to use a natural gas jet-burner (to preheat the combustion chamber) along with a secondary <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> {{in order to get a}} high entrainment of the flue gases by the reactant jets. In fact the air (through the jet-burner) and the gas (through the secondary <b>gas</b> <b>injector)</b> are injected separately in order to get a high dilution of the reactants and a mixture temperature above the auto-ignition threshold. Our test bench consists in a Viessmann hot water boiler whose nominal output power is 370 kW. The combustion chamber of this boiler is cylindrical (length = 1. 41 m, diameter = 0. 56 m) and is water-cooled. A preliminary CFD study (Fluent ®) has first been performed to select on the market a jet burner and to determine the position of the air and gas injectors able to generate the requirements of diluted combustion. The influence of the operating conditions (firing rate and excess air) has also been studied numerically. The simulation results show the possibility to obtain a temperature field quite homogenous (typical of diluted combustion) but with a light increase of the CO level at the exit of the combustion chamber. These numerical results (obtained with a simple combustion model) have to be validated experimentally. A first experimental study has been carried out in classical combustion on the boiler equipped with the selected jet-burner. The temperature field has been measured in the median plane of the combustion chamber for different excess air and firing rate. These measurements allowed us to verify that the preheating obtained with the jet-burner was important enough for getting a temperature level above the auto-ignition temperature near everywhere in the combustion chamber. A second experimental study in diluted combustion on the combustion chamber equipped with the secondary <b>gas</b> <b>injector</b> will allow the validation the corresponding numerical results.

40|$|Disruptions, {{the sudden}} {{termination}} of tokamak fusion plasmas by instabilities, {{have the potential}} to cause severe material wall damage to large tokamaks like ITER. e mitigation of disruption damage {{is an essential part of}} any fusion reactor system. Massive gas injection (MGI) rapid shutdown is a technique in which large amounts of noble gas are injected into the plasma in order to safely radiate the plasma energy evenly over the entire plasma-facing first wall. However, it has been observed that this energy is not radiated evenly: it can have significant asymmetries, which could cause melting in large devices even in the case of a successful rapid shutdown. The first rapid shutdown experiments using multiple <b>gas</b> <b>injectors</b> on any tokamak were conducted on Alcator C-Mod. A dedicated toroidal array of fast ultraviolet photodiodes was installed in order to diagnose toroidal radiation asymmetries during the thermal quench (TQ). It is found that the radiation asymmetry is controlled by a low-n brightness mode in the TQ phase of rapid shutdowns. is mode sometimes rotates, and the rate of rotation sets the integrated radiation asymmetry in the TQ. It is proposed that this brightness feature is caused by the transport of energy from the hot plasma core to the radiative edge by the MHD flow at one phase of an n = 1 global MHD mode. is phenomenology is confirmed by extended MHD simulation using the NIMROD code. An exponentially growing n = 1 magnetic mode is observed during the pre-TQ phase of MGI rapid shutdowns; the saturation of this mode marks the beginning of the thermal quench. It is proposed that this mode is a magnetic island caused by a radiative tearing mode; the predicted growth rate is compared to the predictions of analytic theory. It is proposed that this mode is a magnetic island then couples to other global n = 1 MHD modes, causing the energy transport during the TQ. An important implication of this result is that simply adding more <b>gas</b> <b>injectors</b> cannot guarantee a symmetric rapid shutdown: the asymmetry is controlled by the behavior of the core MHD activity during the TQ. the implications of this rotating radiation asymmetry during the TQ of MGI rapid shutdown for the beryllium wall of ITER are discussed. by Geoffrey Michael Olynyk.
