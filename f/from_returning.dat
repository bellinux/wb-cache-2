5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, {{the chronicle}} records that he was summoned by letter to the Norwegian royal court because Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which was not his by right. The chronicle notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is heard from him.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E
5|$|MacInTalk, the text-to-speech {{program for}} the Apple Macintosh computers, {{was used for the}} voice of AUTO, the rogue {{artificial}} intelligence autopilot built into the ship. Unlike other robots in the film, AUTO is not influenced by WALL-E, but instead follows directive A113, which is to prevent the Axiom and the humans <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to Earth because of the toxicity, and it works to prevent anyone from deviating from it.|$|E

5|$|Ugetsu won the Silver Lion Award for Best Direction at the Venice Film Festival in 1953. The night before, Mizoguchi, {{believing that}} if the film did not win an award the shame would prevent him <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to Japan, stayed {{in his hotel room}} and prayed. In Japan it was named third in Kinema Junpo's Best Ten for Japanese films of 1953. and won two awards at the 8th Mainichi Film Awards.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling asleep}} that night, Sam is visited {{in a dream}} by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|For the JATO project, {{they were}} joined by Caltech {{mathematician}} Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Hasan {{proceeded}} to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning {{fire from the}} city's artillerymen; al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, he attempted to flee Acre on 21 August or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E

5|$|In all, {{four people}} were stabbed during the riots: two English, one Turkish and one Dutch fan. A Danish {{police officer and}} a Turkish {{cameraman}} were also injured in the riots. In total, nineteen people were injured and sixty people were arrested, with 15 of the arrested being subsequently banned from attending Euro 2000. Nineteen of the arrested were British, thirty-six were Turkish {{and the rest of}} the arrested included people from Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. The British fans were later released without charge but were forbidden <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to Denmark. The rest were fined an equivalent of $500 and banned from Denmark for a year.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert kept her <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> at times. When Albert {{decided to return}} to Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1944, Derrick {{was posted}} to an officer cadet {{training}} unit in Victoria. He requested {{that he be}} allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion {{at the end of}} the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared a tent with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and {{has been shown to}} be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer <b>from</b> <b>returning.</b> The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's reign was an {{extremely}} short one; only weeks after his accession, he was slain on Mann. His killer is identified by a contemporary source as a knight named Ívarr {{who may have been}} an ally of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's second cousin once removed, Haraldr Guðrøðarson (fl. 1249), who seized the kingship immediately following the killing. Although at first Haraldr was recognised as a legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England (died 1272), Haraldr was later regarded as a usurper by his Norwegian overlord, Hákon. In 1250, Hákon summoned Haraldr to Norway to answer for his seizure of the kingship, and Haraldr was kept <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to the Isles.|$|E

5|$|The Wessex Division—now {{numbered}} as the 43rd—had {{been assigned}} for duty in India {{to free up}} regular units there, with its staff and support units held back to form {{the framework of the}} new 8th Division, which was formed <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> regular battalions. As a result, Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade, made up from three battalions that had been on garrison duty in Malta and one from Egypt. All were regular units, with very few reservists, but having spent a long period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} home, Shelby {{and his father}} were named commissioners to {{negotiate}} a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga. This service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina. Greene had thought to use Shelby's and Sevier's men to prevent Cornwallis <b>from</b> <b>returning</b> to Charleston. However, Cornwallis was defeated at the Siege of Yorktown, shortly after Shelby and Sevier arrived, and Greene sent them on to join General Francis Marion on the Pee Dee River. On Marion's orders, Shelby and Colonel Hezekiah Maham captured a British fort at Fair Lawn near Moncks Corner on November 27, 1781.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants <b>from</b> <b>returning.</b> Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus. He also forced {{the heads of the}} Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. The absence of the traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban population to be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to request from the government that Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E
