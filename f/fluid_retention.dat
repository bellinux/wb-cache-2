50|$|It may be misguided to {{classify}} the volume-overloaded heart as having diastolic dysfunction {{if it is}} behaving in a stiff and non-compliant manner. The term diastolic dysfunction should not {{be applied to the}} dilated heart. Dilated ("remodeled") hearts have increased volume relative to the amount of diastolic pressure, and therefore have increased (not decreased) distensibility. The term diastolic dysfunction is sometimes erroneously applied in this circumstance, when increased <b>fluid</b> volume <b>retention</b> causes the heart to be over-filled (High output cardiac failure).|$|R
50|$|Many {{regulatory}} {{functions of}} the body are affected. Regulation of body <b>fluids,</b> salt <b>retention,</b> acid and nitrogenous metabolite excretion are all impaired and can fluctuate widely. Body fluid regulation is impaired due to a failure to excrete fluids, or due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea. Regulation of salt is impaired when salt intake is low or the vascular volume is inadequate. Acid excretion and nitrogenous metabolite excretion are impaired {{with the loss of}} kidney function.

25|$|One of {{the primary}} uses of {{metolazone}} is for treating edema (<b>fluid</b> <b>retention)</b> associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). In mild heart failure, metolazone or another diuretic may be used alone, or combined with other diuretics for moderate or severe heart failure. In addition to preventing fluid buildup, the use of metolazone may allow the patient to relax the amount of sodium restriction that is required. Although most thiazide diuretics lose their effectiveness in renal failure, metolazone remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30–40 mL/min (moderate renal failure) (Citation needed). This gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to <b>fluid</b> <b>retention.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether chronic <b>fluid</b> and sodium <b>retention</b> in heart failure adversely affects peripheral arteriolar behavior, systemic vascular resistance and skeletal muscle vasodilation were compared in eight control dogs and nine dogs with chronic <b>fluid</b> and sodium <b>retention</b> (ascites = 2. 3 ± 2. 3 liters) induced by rapid ventricular pacing for 2 months. At rest, both groups exhibited comparable systemic vascular resistance (control 45 ± 14 versus heart failure 40 ± 7 U) and femoral bed vascular resistance (control 18. 7 ± 6. 9 versus heart failure 19. 0 ± 7. 2 × 102 U) (both p = NS). Femoral bed resistance also decreased similarly {{in both groups}} during treadmill exercise (resistance at peak exercise: control 4. 7 ± 3. 0 versus heart failure 4. 9 ± 0. 9 × 102 U [p = NS]). In isolated gracilis muscle, vascular resistance was also comparable in both groups at rest (control 7. 3 ± 3. 3 versus heart failure 10. 2 ± 3. 6 × 103 U/ 100 g), at peak exercise (control 1. 6 ± 0. 5 versus heart failure 1. 8 ± 0. 9 × 103 U/ 100 g) and after maximal vasodilation with papaverine (control 0. 7 ± 0. 3 versus heart failure 0. 9 ± 0. 3 × 103 U/ 100 g) (all p = NS). These data suggest that chronic <b>fluid</b> and sodium <b>retention</b> in heart failure does not alter peripheral arteriolar behavior...|$|R

25|$|Aldosterone release: This {{steroid hormone}} is {{released}} from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II or high serum potassium levels.

30|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} MWT is complex involving the modified crystallization of scale-forming components and modified dispersion stability. These effects cannot {{be explained by}} magnetic attraction among the dispersed particles of iron oxides [[9][10]], because the main scale component form fine nonmagnetic particles, such as calcium carbonate, gypsum and silica. Instead, an explanation {{was found in the}} changes of pH [[11]] or ion distribution/hydration near the dispersed particles to form neutralized surfaces for magnetically enhanced coagulation [[12 – 14]]. Theoretically, surface modification of the dispersed particles under magnetohydrodynamic forces, mainly Lorentz force, was affected by the conductivity of the solution, the flow velocity of the <b>fluid,</b> the <b>retention</b> time of dispersion in the working channel, and the flux density of the field [[14]].

40|$|BackgroundAromatase inhibitors (AIs) {{frequently}} {{lead to the}} AI-induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS). Looking {{into its}} pathophysiology, 6 months of AI therapy thickens the tendon sheath with intra-articular <b>fluid</b> (IAF) <b>retention</b> and loss of grip strength. We here report 24 -month follow-up data. Patients and methodsA prospective cohort study of 33 postmenopausal breast cancer patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy; 27 received an AI and 6 received tamoxifen. At baseline, 6 and 24 months patients had a rheumatologic examination, including a grip strength test, and magnetic resonance imaging of both hands and wrists. The primary end point was tenosynovial changes; secondary end points were changes in morning stiffness, grip strength and IAF. ResultsTwenty-three AI and 5 tamoxifen patients completed all investigations. Between month 6 and 24, IAF further increased in AI users (P =  0. 04) but not in tamoxifen users, and grip strength further decreased in both groups. The worsened tenosynovial changes were strongly correlated with a decrease in grip strength. At 24 months, morning stiffness continued {{to be present in}} over a third of AI users. ConclusionAIMSS represents a substantial problem in breast cancer patients. It is associated with tenosynovial changes, IAF retention, joint stiffness and loss of grip strength that do not improve with prolonged use. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{retention}} of ingesta in {{the digestive tract}} is a major characteristic of herbivorous animals. We measured particle and <b>fluid</b> mean <b>retention</b> times (MRT) in 13 lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) and 5 Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus) from five zoological institutions on their usual zoo diet and 2 lowland and 4 Malayan tapirs additionally on roughage-only diets (total n of trials = 24) with cobalt-EDTA as fluid and chromium-mordanted fibre (< 2 mm) as particle markers. MRT for fluid and particles averaged 42 ± 16 h and 55 ± 18 h in lowland and 40 ± 13 h and 56 ± 14 h in Malayan tapirs. In a General Linerar Model, neither Tapir species, body mass nor diet (characteriszed by the proportion of roughage) {{was significantly related to}} MRT, but dry matter intake was, with a steep decline in MRT with higher intake levels. Compared to other hindgut fermenters, tapirs have a low defecation frequency, which might be linked to their comparatively low food intake. Their gastrointestinal capacity (in dry matter: 1. 63 ± 0. 63 % of body mass) is similar to that calculated for horses. A comparison of the difference in fluid and particle MRT in large hindgut fermenters (horses, rhinoceroses, elephants, and the tapirs of this study) show that longer absolute particle MRT are linked to shorter relative fluid MRT, possibly indicating a more thorough ‘washing’ of particulate ingesta with digestive fluids at longer particle MRT. The only outlier to this general pattern, with an exceptionally high difference between fluid and particle MRT, indicating a particularly efficient ingesta washing, is the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum).

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pleural fluid pH {{measurement}} {{is important}} in the management of patients with exudative pleural effusions, especially in guiding treatment of parapneumonic effusions. Common variations in the method used to sample pleural fluid affect the accuracy of the value obtained. This article reviews the effects of these variations. RECENT FINDINGS: Pleural fluid pH is decreased by exposure to acidic <b>fluids,</b> such as <b>retention</b> of local anesthetic or heparin in the syringe or sampling following infiltration of local anesthetic. Exposure of the sample to air leads to an increase in pH. If immediate analysis is not possible, delay of up to 4 h does not cause a significant change in pH, even when the sample is kept at room temperature. It is essential that a blood gas analyzer is used to obtain accurate pH measurement. These factors have less effect on the glucose concentration, which may be used to guide management if an accurate pH value is not available. SUMMARY: Several common variables in collection method can lead to a clinically significant alteration in the pH value obtained. An evidence-based method for sampling and handling pleural fluid in order to obtain an accurate pH measurement is described...|$|R
25|$|Regardless of the cause, {{sequestration}} {{of fluid}} within the abdomen leads to additional <b>fluid</b> <b>retention</b> by the kidneys due to stimulatory effect on blood pressure hormones, notably aldosterone.

40|$|In a {{completely}} randomised grazing trial, 8 cows in mid-lactation were offered white clover pasture (35 kg DM/cow/day) with 4 of the cows given a supplement of maize silage (8 kg DM/cow/day). Factors evaluated over a 28 day period were total DMI, pasture DM/maize silage DM substitution rate, herbage selection in the pasture, milk yield, fat and protein concentration. Supplementing cows with maize silage increased total DMI by 22 % and lowered pasture herbage DMI by 21 %; {{equivalent to a}} substitution rate of 0. 5 kg pasture DM /kg of maize silage DM. Selection of herbage in the pasture was not affected by supplementation, but cows on both treatments selectively grazed the white clover. Supplementing cows with maize silage increased milk yield by 34 %, fat yield by 35 % and protein yield by 35 % (P< 0. 05), but did not affect milk fat and protein concentration. In a metabolism trial, 6 rumen fistulated cows in mid-lactation were fed similar diets in a crossover experiment but with white clover fed ad libitum. Digestibility, nitrogen balance, milk yield, fat and protein concentration were evaluated over a 7 day period. Maize silage DM and white clover DM digestion in the rumen were evaluated by DM disappearance rates from nylon bags over a 96 hr period. Measurments of rumen fluid volume, <b>fluid</b> mean <b>retention</b> time, <b>fluid</b> outflow, pH, ammonia and VFA concentration and the acetate/propionate ratio were estimated over a 24 hr period. Supplementing cows with maize silage increased total DMI by 34 %, without affecting DM digestibility (DMD). However, OMD was reduced by 5 % and fibre digestion by 18 % (P< 0. 05). Supplementing cows with maize silage {{did not affect the}} rate of digestion of maize silage DM or white clover DM in nylon bags, but white clover was digested at a faster rate than maize silage (P< 0. 05). The increased DOMI by cows supplemented with maize silage was highly correlated with a 24 % increase in milk yield (P< 0. 05; iI= 61) but had no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. At similar nitrogen intakes cows supplemented with maize silage produced 2. 3 kg more milk (P< 0. 050 =' 66) but there was no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. Rumen <b>fluid</b> volume, mean <b>retention</b> time and <b>fluid</b> outflow rate were not significantly altered by the maize silage supplement, although rumen pH and ammonia concentration were significantly lower (P< 0. 05). Total VFA concentration was not significantly different between the two diets, but acetate concentration was significantly lower (P< 0. 05), while propionate concentration was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in supplemented cows. The reduction in acetate and the corresponding increase in propionate, lowered the acetate/propionate ratio. Butyrate concentration was not affected. It was concluded that for cows in mid-lactation fed on good quality white clover dominant pasture, maize silage supplementation can increase milk yield, without affecting milk fat and protein concentration. The increase in milk yield was attributed to increased apparent energy intake as nitrogen intake did not change markedly. However further work is required to quantify whether increased nitrogen utilization occurred and whether the lower ammonia concentration in maize silage supplemented cows were due to improved rumen microbial synthesis. The possibility also exists that improved milk yields were due to by-pass rumen starch, thereby providing glucose to the animal, after enzymatic digestion in the small intestine.

A novel {{mesoporous}} composite {{water purification}} material was synthesized from natural zeolite to possess certain water purification properties {{as well as}} in proper particle size range for optimal <b>fluid</b> flow, particle <b>retention</b> and mass transfer in fixed bed applications. The meerschaum was used as the framework material in the experimental manufacturing procedure, polyethylene alcohol with carboxylic methylic cellulose was used as cohesive reagent, and H 2 O 2 as bubble-forming agent. And the resulted granular product has good abrasion resistance ability with the measured impact breaking time reaching 12 hours. In addition, its decoloring rate is only 4. 4 % lower and its CODcr removing is only 13. 2 % lower than those of the original powder product, respectively. As a whole, the granulation potential and significantly expands the zeolite wastewater treatment application range with (only is not necessary) minor reduction of its treatment efficiency. Experiment When a water purification material is used there is a clear assumption, the smaller particle size is, the larger proportion of surface area is, getting more contact between the cleaning material and the pollutant, and ensuring a better purification effect.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease.   Heart failure may lead to acute kidney injury and vice versa. Chronic kidney disease may affect the clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disorders. Renal impairment with any degree of albuminuria has been increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and heart failure hospitalizations, while chronic heart failure may cause chronic kidney disease. The bidirectional nature of these disorders contributes to the complexity and the composite definitions of cardiorenal syndromes. However, the most important clinical trials in heart failure tend to exclude patients with significant renal dysfunction. The mechanisms whereby renal insufficiency worsens the outcome in heart failure are not known, and several pathways could contribute to the ‘‘vicious heart/kidney circle. ’’ Traditionally, renal impairment has been attributed to the renal hypoperfusion due to reduced cardiac output and decreased systemic pressure. The hypovolemia leads to sympathetic activity, increased renin-angiotensin aldosterone pathway, and arginine-vasopressin release. These mechanisms cause <b>fluid</b> and sodium <b>retention,</b> peripheral vasoconstriction, and volume overload.
