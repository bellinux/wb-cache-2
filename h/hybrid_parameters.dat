40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor and {{diagnose}} complex physical systems is critical for constructing highly autonomous artifacts that can function robustly in harsh environments {{over a long period}} of time. To accomplish this, we need to use high fidelity models that describe both the discrete stochastic behavior and the continuous dynamics of these complex systems. These models are used by a hybrid monitoring and diaj~nosis capability that tracks a system's dynamics as it moves between distinctive behavioral modes. In this thesis, we address the challenge of learning these hybrid discrete/continuous models.

40|$|Many recent {{applications}} of computer graphics and human computer interaction have adopted both colour cameras and depth cameras as input devices. Therefore, an effective calibration of {{both types of}} hardware taking different colour and depth inputs is required. Our approach removes the numerical difficulties of using non-linear optimization in previous methods which explicitly resolve camera intrinsics {{as well as the}} transformation between depth and colour cameras. A matrix of <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> is introduced to linearize our optimization. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> offer a transformation from a depth parametric space (depth camera image) to a colour parametric space (colour camera image) by combining the intrinsic parameters of depth camera and a rotation transformation from depth camera to colour camera. Both the rotation transformation and intrinsic parameters can be explicitly calculated from our <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> {{with the help of a}} standard QR factorisation. We test our algorithm with both synthesized data and real-world data where ground-truth depth information is captured by Microsoft Kinect.

40|$|Most {{techniques}} for power system analysis model the grid by exact electrical circuits. For instance, in power flow study, state estimation, and voltage stability assessment, {{the use of}} admittance parameters (i. e., the nodal admittance matrix) and <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> is common. Moreover, network reduction techniques (e. g., Kron reduction) are often applied to decrease the size of large grid models (i. e., with {{hundreds or thousands of}} state variables), thereby alleviating the computational burden. However, researchers normally disregard the fact that the applicability of these methods is not generally guaranteed. In reality, the nodal admittance must satisfy certain properties in order for <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> to exist and Kron reduction to be feasible. Recently, this problem was solved for the particular cases of monophase and balanced triphase grids. This paper investigates the general case of unbalanced polyphase grids. Firstly, conditions determining the rank of the so-called compound nodal admittance matrix and its diagonal subblocks are deduced from the characteristics of the electrical components and the network graph.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recursively identifying the parameters of a switched ARX (SARX) model from input/output data {{under the assumption that}} the number of models, the model orders and the switching sequence are unknown. Our approach exploits the fact that applying a polynomial embedding to the input/output data leads to a lifted ARX model whose dynamics are linear on the so-called hybrid model parameters and independent of the switching sequence. In principle, one can use a standard recursive algorithm to identify such <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters.</b> However, when the number of models and the model orders are unknown the embedded regressors may not be persistently exciting, hence the estimates of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>parameters</b> may not converge exponentially to a constant vector. Nevertheless, we show that these estimates still converge to a vector that depends continuously on the initial condition. By identifying the hybrid model parameters starting from two different initial conditions, we show that one can build two homogeneous polynomials whose derivatives at a regressor give an estimate of the parameters of the ARX model generating that regressor. After properly enforcing some of the entries of the hybrid model parameters to be zero, such estimates are shown to converge exponentially to the true ARX model parameters under suitable persistence of excitation conditions on the input/output data. Although our algorithm is designed for the case of perfect input/output data, our experiments also show its performance with noisy data. I...|$|E
