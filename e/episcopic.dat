On this screen there is typically a grid that can be rotated 360 degrees so the X-Y axis of the screen can be aligned with a straight edge of the machined part to examine or measure. This projection screen displays {{the profile of}} the specimen and is magnified for better ease of calculating linear measurements.An edge of the specimen to examine may be lined up with the grid on the screen. From there, simple measurements may be taken for distances to other points. This is being done on a magnified profile of the specimen. It can be simpler as well as reduce errors by measuring on the magnified projection screen of a profile projector. The typical method for lighting is by diascopic illumination, which is lighting from behind. This type of lighting is also called transmitted illumination when the specimen is translucent and light can pass through it. If the specimen is opaque, then the light will not go through it, but will form a profile of the specimen. Measuring of the sample can be done on the projection screen. A profile projector may also have <b>episcopic</b> illumination (which is light shining from above). This useful in displaying bores or internal areas that may need to be measured.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This work aims at {{describing}} <b>episcopic</b> 3 D imaging {{methods and}} at discussing how these methods can contrib-ute to researching the genetic mechanisms driving embryogenesis and tissue remodelling, and {{the genesis of}} pathologies. Several <b>episcopic</b> 3 D imaging methods exist. The most advanced are capable of generating high-resolution volume data (voxel sizes from 0. 5 x 0. 5 x 1 m upwards) of small to large embryos of model organisms and tissue samples. Beside anat-omy and tissue architecture, gene expression and gene product patterns can be three dimensionally analyzed in their pre-cise anatomical and histological context {{with the aid of}} whole mount in situ hybridization or whole mount immunohisto-chemical staining techniques. <b>Episcopic</b> 3 D imaging techniques were and are employed for analyzing the precise morpho-logical phenotype of experimentally malformed, randomly produced, or genetically engineered embryos of biomedical model organisms. It has been shown that <b>episcopic</b> 3 D imaging also fits for describing the spatial distribution of genes and gene products during embryogenesis, and that it can be used for analyzing tissue samples of adult model animals and hu-mans. The latter offers the possibility to use <b>episcopic</b> 3 D imaging techniques for researching the causality and treatment of pathologies or for staging cancer. Such applications, however, are not yet routine and currently only preliminary results are available. We conclude that, although <b>episcopic</b> 3 D imaging is in its very beginnings, it represents an upcoming meth-odology, which in short terms will become an indispensable tool for researching the genetic regulation of embryo devel-opment as well as the genesis of malformations and diseases...|$|E

Foods such as salads pose a greater risk because they are consumed raw and have {{been the source of}} major outbreaks of disease from fresh produce. The novel light microscopy methods used in this study allow detailed, high resolution imaging of the leaf surface environment (the phyllosphere) and allow pathogen tracking. <b>Episcopic</b> differential interference contrast microscopy coupled with epifluorescence was used to view the natural microflora in situ on salad leaves and their topographical distribution. Fluorescent nucleic acid staining was used to differentiate between bacterial colonists and inorganic debris. Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson expressing green fluorescent protein was inoculated onto individual spinach leaves for 24 h at 22 °C in order to observe spatial and temporal patterning of colonization on the two surfaces of each leaf under different osmotic conditions. The results obtained show that salad leaves are host to high numbers of bacteria, typically 105 per square millimetre. Cells are present in complex three-dimensional aggregations which often have a slimy appearance, suggesting the presence of biofilms. Washing of the leaves had little effect on the number of adherent pathogens, suggesting very strong attachment. <b>Episcopic</b> differential interference contrast microscopy is a rapid alternative to both scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy for visualizing leaf topography and biofilm formation in the natural state...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{and precise}} {{phenotyping}} analysis {{of large numbers}} of wild-type and mutant mouse embryos is essential for characterizing the genetic and epigenetic factors regulating embryogenesis. We present a novel methodology that permits precise high-throughput screening of the phenotype of embryos with both targeted and randomly generated mutations. To demonstrate the potential of this methodology we show embryo phenotyping results produced in a large-scale ENU-mutagenesis study. In essence this represents an analysis pipeline, which starts with simultaneous micro-magentic resonance imaging (µMRI) screening (voxel size: 25. 4 × 25. 4 × 24. 4 µm) of 32 embryos in one run. Embryos with an indistinct phenotype are then cut into parts and suspect organs and structures are analysed with HREM (high-resolution <b>episcopic</b> microscopy). HREM is an imaging technique that employs ‘positive’ eosin staining and <b>episcopic</b> imaging for generating three-dimensional (3 D) high-resolution (voxel size: 1. 07 × 1. 07 × 2 µm) digital data of near histological contrast and quality. The results show that our method guarantees the rapid availability of comprehensive phenotype information for high numbers of embryos in, if necessary, histological quality and detail. The combination of high-throughput µMRI with HREM provides an alternative screening pipeline with advantages over existing 3 D phenotype screening methods as well as traditional histology. Thus, the µMRI-HREM phenotype analysis pipeline recommends itself as a routine tool for analysing the phenotype of transgenic and mutant embryos...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of a computer-assisted, three-dimensional reconstruction procedure for serial sections to embryonic rat hearts {{during the period of}} cardiac looping and compartmentalization is described. The procedure relies on immunohistochemical staining for the introduction of selective contrast and on <b>episcopic</b> and diascopic images of each of the sections for alignment and correction of compression due to sectioning. <b>Episcopic</b> (reference) images are taken from the embedding block just before the cutting of a slice and are still aligned and undeformed. Diascopic images are taken from the sections after immunohistochemical processing and, hence, contain selective contrast but are deformed and no longer aligned. The three-dimensional images are visualized as shaded voxel models. This approach allowed the unequivocal delineation of the developing myocardium and the inspection of its changing architecture both from the outside and from within. Furthermore, it allowed a quantification of myocardial volume. Because standardized and hence comparable views of three different stages were generated, changes {{in the shape of the}} cardiac loop, the atria, and the ventricles as well as changes in the position of the atrioventricular canal and interventricular foramen could be accurately described. Characteristic changes in the position of both the right ventricle and the atrioventricular canal that are essential for the formation of a correctly functioning four-chambered heart could be observed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{developmental}} {{process through}} which the cloaca transforms from one hollow structure to two separated urinary and digestive outlets remains controversial and speculative. Here, we use high-resolution <b>episcopic</b> microscopy to examine a comprehensive series of normal and mutant mouse cloaca in which the detailed 3 -dimensional (3 -D) morphological features are illuminated throughout the development. We provide evidence that the dorsal peri-cloacal mesenchyme (dPCM) remains stationary while other surrounding tissues grow towards it. This causes dramatic changes of spatial relationship among caudal structures and morphological transformation of the cloaca. The 3 -D characterizations of Dkk 1 mutants reveal a hyperplastic defect of dPCM, {{which leads to a}} significant anterior shift of the caudal boundary of the cloaca, premature occlusion of the cloaca and, imperforate anus phenotype. Conversely, Shh knockout causes a severe hypoplastic defect of cloaca mesenchyme including dPCM and persistent cloaca. Collectively, these findings suggest that formation of the dPCM is critical for cloacal morphogenesis and furthermore, growth and movement of the mesenchymal tissues towards the dPCM lead to the cloaca occlusion and separation of the urinary and digestive outlets...|$|E

40|$|<b>Episcopic</b> {{fluorescence}} image capturing (EFIC) and high-resolution episcopicmicroscopy (HREM) {{are related}} techniques {{that are used}} to generate digital volume data and create three-dimensional (3 D) images. Both techniques require specimens that are embedded in an appropriate medium, and images are captured from successive sections before removal from the embedded tissue block. EFIC detects autofluorescence emitted from the embedded tissue, whereas HREM requires the tissue to be stained with a fluorescent dye such as eosin. Different procedures are therefore necessary for embedding tissue for EFIC or HREM imaging. For HREM, the choice of fixative appears to be of little consequence. If gene expression patterns are to be visualized in addition to tissue architecture, whole-mount staining for gene expression patterns using the 4 -nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) / 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl phosphate (BCIP) or LacZ detection system must be performed before embedding of samples.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} imaging cardiac developmental malfunctions in {{the mouse}} embryo. Studies of human genetic architecture cannot provide a mechanistic understanding of gene function in cardiac development, {{and analysis of}} gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in humans remains a challenge. These considerations necessitate the use of animal models, the most appropriate and widely used being the mouse. Like the human, the mouse has a four-chambered heart with a septated outflow tract, left-sided great arteries, and parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations. Common cardiac malformations such as septal, outflow tract, and aortic arch and pulmonary trunk defects can thus be identified in mouse embryos, and mouse mutations typically recapitulate the cardiac malformations observed in patients with mutations in the same genes (reviewed in Schneider and Bhattacharya, 2004). Imaging such a complex and dynamic structure as the developing heart {{plays a crucial role}} in such studies, underlying accurate assessment of phenotype. New anatomical imaging techniques such as optical projection tomography, high resolution <b>episcopic</b> microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging provide ways to supplement conventional histology with comprehensive image data, yielding three-dimensional models that allow systematic, quantitative comparisons of structure. These imaging methods have complementary strengths, and by combining them it is possible to envisage a powerful cardiac phenotyping pipeline. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

This study looks at the acquisition and digital modelling of data describing breast duct branching from thick ('subgross') sections using data structures from the neurosciences, and at high-throughput imaging of duct anatomy in the nipple. Methods. The branching of a large breast duct system was modelled using data extracted from cleared and stained 2 mm 'subgross' sections of an autopsy breast using a public-domain neuron modelling program (CVAPP), and <b>episcopic</b> fluorescence image capture (EFIC) was used to collect a stack of 1100 autofluorescence images of ducts in a mastectomy nipple. Results. The duct skeleton was captured in 440 line segments with some pruning of terminal ducts. Extracting this data manually in a usable form was, however, laborious and error prone, emphasising the need for improved morphological informatics.

Since articular chondrocytes descend from a distinct cohort of progenitor cells located in embryonic nascent joints (interzones), establishing the timing of equine interzone formation is an essential first step towards understanding equine joint and articular cartilage development. OBJECTIVES: To establish the time frame during which the equine femorotibial interzone forms. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive anatomical study. METHODS: Equine embryos were harvested at 37 (E 37), 40, 42, 45, 50 and 65 days' gestation. The femorotibial interzone was examined using high-resolution <b>episcopic</b> microscopy of E 37, E 42, E 45, E 50 and E 65. Additional histology and collagen-II-immunohistochemistry were performed on E 42. RESULTS: At E 37, the femorotibial interzone is first visible as a uniform layer, while at E 42 the interzone is fully formed and consists of 3 morphologically distinct layers. The first evidence of cavitation was seen at E 45. At E 50, the cruciate ligaments were well formed and by E 65, joint formation appeared complete.

We are developing imaging methods based upon MRI and intravascular microcoils. In order to rigorously validate our MRI imaging methods and algorithms, we have developed a new cryo-imaging system that allows one to alternately section and image the block face of tissue. We obtain 3 D pathology of vessel segments excised from cadaver and we characterize the tissues of atheroma using <b>episcopic</b> autofluorescence and bright field microscopy images. After embedding the vessel, the block is frozen, and block face microscopic images are taken every 200 μm with an image resolution of 30 μm× 30 μm. The series of images is then corrected for uneven illumination, serially registered to one another, and the 3 D vessel segment is reconstructed. Some sections are recovered and processed with histological staining for validation. Seven tissue types can be readily identified from the cryo-images: necrotic core, calcification, lipid pool, media, adventitia, fibrosis, thrombus, and normal intima. Since the whole vessel segment is available, we could register 3 D data to images from MR, or other modalities, for validation. In addition, visualization tools such as multi-planar reformatting 3 D rendering can be used to study 3 D plaque morphology, in microscopic detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{arrival of}} simple and {{reliable}} methods for 3 D imaging of mouse embryos {{has opened the}} possibility of analysing normal and abnormal development in a far more systematic and comprehensive manner than has hitherto been possible. This will not only help to extend our understanding of normal tissue and organ development but, by applying the same approach to embryos from genetically modified mouse lines, such imaging studies could also transform our knowledge of gene function in embryogenesis and the aetiology of developmental disorders. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium is coordinating efforts to phenotype single gene knockouts covering the entire mouse genome, including characterising developmental defects for those knockout lines that prove to be embryonic lethal. Here, we present a pilot study of 34 such lines, utilising high-resolution <b>episcopic</b> microscopy (HREM) for comprehensive 2 D and 3 D imaging of homozygous null embryos and their wild-type littermates. We present a simple phenotyping protocol that has been developed {{to take advantage of}} the high-resolution images obtained by HREM and that can be used to score tissue and organ abnormalities in a reliable manner. Using this approach with embryos at embryonic day 14. 5, we show the wide range of structural abnormalities that are likely to be detected in such studies and the variability in phenotypes between sibling homozygous null embryos...|$|E
40|$|The {{ineffective}} {{cleaning of}} surgical instruments {{may be a}} vector for the transmission of hospital-acquired infections. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate whether further decontamination procedures need to be instigated in sterile-service departments (SSDs) {{to reduce the risk of}} nosocomial illnesses, such as endotoxemia, sepsis, or iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (to date, 1, 147 cases of confirmed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease deaths in the United Kingdom since 1990 have been reported). Instrument sets were obtained from nine anonymous United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) primary care trust SSDs. The investigation implemented an advanced light microscopy technique, <b>episcopic</b> differential interference contrast microscopy with the sensitive fluorescent reagents SYPRO Ruby and 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), to detect proteinaceous and microbial contamination levels. Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin was monitored using a dansylated polymyxin B fluorochrome agent. None of the 260 instruments examined displayed signs of microbial colonization or LPS endotoxin contamination. However, over 60 percent of the instruments showed a high degree of protein soiling (0. 4 to 4. 2 mu g protein/mm(2)). Some instruments appeared soiled with crystalline deposits that may consist of a potentially hazardous material contributing to inflammation and/or surgical shock. It is clear that the overall standard for cleaning must be raised in order to fulfill the imminent introduction of new European standards and to reduce the risk of cross-patient contamination and iatrogenic transmissio...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} instilling 13 commonly used preservatives on the murine cornea in vivo. Due to the instillation of preservatives, micro-lesions are formed on the cornea and can be selectively marked by fluorescein. The sum of the resulting fluorescent areas was measured using an <b>episcopic</b> microscope coupled to an image processing system. All the tested preservatives proved to be well-tolerated by the eye at commonly used concentrations. However, in some cases, increased concentrations of preservatives or combinations resulted in significant increase {{of the amount of}} corneal damage. With increasing the concentration, corneal lesion increased the most in the case of cetylpyridinium. While a combination of chlorobutanol 0. 5 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 5 % did not result in an increase in corneal damage (when compared to the use of each separately), the associations of thiomersal 0. 02 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 4 % on one hand and of edetate disodium (EDTA) 0. 1 % and benzalkonium 0. 01 % on the other, resulted in significant increases in the amount of corneal damage. However, in none of the tested combinations, the increase in the observed damage exceed the limit of ocular intolerance we had defined beforehand: thus, they were all deemed relatively well-tolerated. In {{the last part of the}} study, we {{investigated the}} effects of combining several preservatives, at usual concentrations, with an anesthetic solution of oxybuprocaine and found no notable increase in ocular damage...|$|E
40|$|Molecular imaging, {{which is}} the {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) visualization of gene expression patterns, is indispensable {{for the study of}} the function of genes in cardiac development. The instrumentation, as well as the development of specific contrast agents for molecular imaging, has shown spectacular advances in the last decade. In this review, the spatial resolutions, contrast agents, and applications of these imaging methods in the field of cardiac embryology are discussed. Apart from 3 D reconstructions from histological sections, not many of these methods have been applied in embryological research. This review shows that, for most methods, neither the spatial resolutions nor the specificity and applicability of the contrast agents are adequate for the reliable imaging of specific gene expression at the microscopic resolution required for embryological studies of small organs like the developing heart. Although a 3 D reconstruction from sections will always suffer from imperfections, the resulting reconstructions meet the aim of most biological studies, especially since the original microscopic images are linked. With respect to imaging of gene expression, only histological sections and laser scanning microscopy provide the required resolution and specificity at the tissue and cellular level. <b>Episcopic</b> fluorescence image capturing and optical projection tomography are being used for microscopic phenotyping and lineage analysis, and both show potential for detailed molecular imaging. Other methods can be used very efficiently in rapid evaluation of biological experiments and high-throughput screens of large-scale gene expression profiling efforts when high spatial resolution is not require...|$|E
40|$|Inspection of {{optically}} {{rough surfaces}} {{in search of}} defects or other surface features with deterministic reflectance distributions is a subject well suited to optical techniques. We present a device with <b>episcopic</b> coaxial illumination, specifically developed for such kind of inspection tasks, which simultaneously renders both a coherent image and the spatial spectrum of {{a portion of the}} surf ace, precisely defined by the illuminating laser spot. It is based on the well- known single-lens coherent image processing system, with beamsplitters added to insert the illuminating laser beam and to allow simultaneous access to the Fourier transf orm and the image planes. The device allows inspecting the speckle signature of surface features in both planes, thus allowing different defect recognition appr oaches. By selecting the size of the illuminated area of the object or the lens aperture, different speckle sizes can be obtai ned. If the speckle size is made large enough, identification of individual features can be {{made on the basis of}} their particular speckle signatures. Some envisaged applications are the characterization of defects or structures in rough surfaces, the evaluation of speckle statistics in precisely defined zones of surfaces or the identification of authentication marks.
