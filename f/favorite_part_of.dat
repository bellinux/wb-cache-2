500|$|Hancock was Peter Berg's {{first film}} with visual effects as {{critical}} cinematic elements. He considered the computer-generated fight his least <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the film, citing limited control {{in making the}} scene successful. According to the director, [...] "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're {{at the mercy of}} your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented... it's definitely the time we have the least amount of control as directors." [...] He and other filmmakers worked {{to cut down on the}} fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E

Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show, because it allows him to improvise.

500|$|Zack Handlen's July 2009 {{review for}} The A.V. Club in July 2009 gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen's least <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the episode, {{and with the}} {{exception}} of that character, {{it was one of the}} better scripts seen in The Original Series. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying [...] "The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock." ...|$|E

[...] His <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the episode was when the two teams worked together; he gave {{particular attention to the}} Walter-Walternate talk, remarking, [...] "The last scene between the two Walters is something that I’ve been waiting to see for years now, and John Noble nails both sides of the conversation. It’s now one of the whole series’ signature moments: Walter and Walternate, side-by-side." [...] Other critics also lauded the conversation between Walter and Walternate over Peter.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{acceptance}} of the Bacon cover by Doubleday, Dystel did not like the cover, and assigned New York illustrator Roger Kastel to do a different one for the paperback. Following Bacon's concept, Kastel illustrated his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the novel, the opening where the shark attacks Chrissie. For research, Kastel went to the American Museum of Natural History, and took advantage of the Great White exhibits being closed for cleaning to photograph the models. The photographs then provided reference for a [...] "ferocious-looking shark that was still realistic." [...] After painting the shark, Kastel did the female swimmer. Following a photoshoot for Good Housekeeping, Kastel requested the model he was photographing to lie on a stool in the approximate position of a front crawl. The oil-on-board painting Kastel created for the cover would eventually be reused by Universal Studios on the film posters.|$|E

When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said {{he felt it was}} merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. Larry Crane, Smith's posthumous archivist, has said that he was surprised at the amount of [...] "recycling of musical ideas" [...] that he has encountered while cataloging the singer's private tapes: [...] "I found songs recorded in high school reworked 15 years on.

500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend.

In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs.

It's probably cos she's flirting and they're shouting." [...] He went on to criticize the song for being too similar to [...] "Don't Trust Me," [...] commenting, [...] "There's not a lot in it between this and 'Don't Trust Me', musically or thematically speaking."

500|$|Smith's {{return to}} the U.S. on July 22, 1983, was celebrated {{by the people of}} Maine with roses, a red carpet, and a {{limousine}} and her popularity continued to grow in her native country. Some critics at the time remained skeptical, believing Smith was unwittingly serving as an instrument of Soviet propaganda. In December 1983, continuing in her role as [...] "America's Youngest Ambassador", she was invited to Japan, where she met with the Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and attended the Children's International Symposium in Kobe. In her speech at the symposium, she suggested that Soviet and American leaders exchange granddaughters for two weeks every year, arguing that a president [...] "wouldn't want to send a bomb to a country his granddaughter would be visiting". Her trip inspired other exchanges of child goodwill ambassadors, including a visit by the eleven-year-old Soviet child Katya Lycheva to the United States.

The band had more [...] "creative freedom" [...] while making the album, compared to their 2009 self-titled debut album. They felt they could [...] "plan the process more", which included inviting the Swedish Army drum corps to play military drums on several tracks, such as [...] "The Wave". Karlsson told Billboard that his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the song occurs during the second verse, in which all band members are hitting the drums simultaneously. [...] "We hit anything we could hit at the same time ... and it sounded kind of cool", he said. Nils Törnqvist is credited for playing the drums, while David Lindberg, Jonathan Lundberg and Claes Malmberg played the military drums.

Paste magazine's Jeffrey Bloomer likened the episode simply to pulp and felt that Dexter's voice overs lacked their usual [...] "dry, dark humor and gonzo wisdom". IGN critic Matt Fowler believed that Dexter and Miguel's conversations contained [...] "traces of overly awkward dialogue all over" [...] and that the pairings of Debra and Quinn, and LaGuerta and Ellen were [...] "forced" [...] while Miguel's desire to kill seemed [...] "unnatural". Writing for TV Guide, Paula Paige said that her <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the episode was Dexter's spinning Fleeter on the table like a roulette wheel and also she enjoyed Rita's storyline, calling her a [...] "hormonal hoot". TV Squad's Debra McDuffee thought that Angel and Barbara's romance was [...] "painfully awkward" [...] to watch and Rita's storyline was [...] "lame and stereotypical". The A.V.
