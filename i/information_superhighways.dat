They {{are able to}} do this so well that, in many respects, large-scale networks appear as coherent, almost intelligent, organisms. The design and control of such networks present challenges of a mathematical, engineering and economic nature.

40|$|Summary: The {{subject of}} <b>information</b> <b>superhighways</b> first {{surfaced}} in the United States in November 1991 and was then adopted in Europe and Japan. This article analyses public policies in the three areas of the Triad, focusing more specifically on French, British and German attitudes. The author assesses technological constraints {{on the impact of}} ideological and cultural factors, and on the current process of harmonization aimed at a truly universal service.

40|$|Ultimately the USA {{will have}} a {{universal}} broadband network (UBN). This report summarizes and comments on Bruce Egan's recent book, <b>Information</b> <b>Superhighways,</b> which addresses transitional problems. First, {{we need to know}} the extent to which consumers would value a UBN network. Who should bear the risks associated with massive infrastructure investments? Next, there are questions about whether demand-pull technological progress is also expected to reduce costs in the long run and to improve quality of service. Egan reminds us that some stakeholders will gain and some will lose during the 1990 s. The regulatory policies adopted in the coming years will influence the pace and pattern of investment in advanced public communication networks in the USA. Egan argues that it is important that policy discourage fragmentation within the network. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{working paper}} No. 179, 1994, of the Center for Coordination Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{describes}} the concept as follows: [...] "The <b>information</b> <b>superhighway</b> directly connects millions of people, each both a consumer {{of information and}} a potential provider. (...) Most predictions about commercial opportunities on the <b>information</b> <b>superhighway</b> focus on the provision of information products, such as video on demand, and on new sales outlets for physical products, as with home shopping. (...) The <b>information</b> <b>superhighway</b> brings together millions of individuals who could exchange information with one another. Any conception of a traditional market for making beneficial exchanges, such as an agricultural market or trading pit, or any system where individuals respond to posted prices {{on a computer screen}} is woefully inadequate for the extremely large number of often complex trades that will be required." ...|$|R
40|$|New {{public sphere}} is {{characterized}} by the digital gadgets, global village, international citizenship and new global society. However, the common thread cutting through all these new concepts is the virtual soul of ‘connectivity’ that is riding on the ‘networking-tools’ which have now grown into an unprecedented giant ‘network-of-networks’ or simply put the ‘Internet’ with ‘social-networking’ and ‘social-software’ as the latest communication tools. International citizens travel on the <b>information</b> <b>superhighways</b> 24 / 7 and the communications across the planet never stops. It is however argued that NPS offers both challenges and prospects for the users depending on the availability of digital gadgets and digital literacy of the global citizens. This paper explores the pluses and minuses of this emerging environment for the members of global civil society by postulating a grounded model of the issue...|$|E
40|$|As organisations {{enter an}} era of <b>information</b> <b>superhighways,</b> {{expanded}} electronic commerce, and “virtualness,” executives increasingly realise {{that in addition to}} business strategy influencing IT, IT now influences business strategy (Rockart et al., 1996). Hirschheim and Sabherwal (2001) confirmed the validity of previous findings and determined that it is important for organisations to understand the dynamic and emergent nature of business-information systems alignment. Recent perspectives on strategy argue that the basis for achieving competitive advantage, even short term advantage, lies in the configuration of resources that enable value creation through a sustained dynamic and continuous process of adaptation and change (Wheeler, 2002; Zahra 2 ̆ 6 George, 2002; Breu 2 ̆ 6 Peppard, 2001).

40|$|Leading {{industrialized nations}} are now {{involved}} in the full implementation of national <b>information</b> <b>superhighways.</b> Their efforts will depend largely on the roles and levels of involvement of public institutions and how this is perceived and reacted to by the private sector. Through the evolution of eight scenarios of public institution involvement, this paper extrapolates the consequences that each brings about {{in the development of}} a national information superhighway. In particular, this paper examines the consequences of the development of an information superhighway for the UK within the context of each scenario and draws comparisons with developments in other countries. Contrary to popular belief, we show that there is no full solution for the shortcomings experienced in the development of the UK’s information superhighway; rather, each scenario offers solutions for a subset of the shortcomings...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. [263]- 275) and indexThe Asian {{region is}} seeing the largest expansion of telecommunications in history. From rural communications to <b>information</b> <b>superhighways,</b> {{the demand for}} equipment and services is the fastest growing in the world. What is driving it? How is it to be financed? Where will the equipment come from? Trade in telecommunications and related information and media services is also growing rapidly throughout the region, and is forcing many Asian governments to respond and protect their national interest. At the same time, local Asian companies are becoming regional players in their own right. This book is a timely examination of all these issues.

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to {{highlight}} an overlooked impact of transportation improvements [...] the ways improvements stimulate innovation {{and the development of}} technologies. Social and economic progress is then achieved through the use of new technologies. Does consideration of technological impacts clarify understandings of transportation improvements? Using IVHS as a case at point, we will treat that question after providing a classification of impacts and discussing the mechanisms yielding impacts. Although recognizing that there are many factors involved, we will highlight technology as the engine of economic and social progress. We regard technologies as ways of doing things embodied in human skills, products, processes and institutions. The topic seems timely. Such recent initiatives as the Oresund bridge in Malmo-Copenhagen, high speed rail and Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) all beg impact questions. Transportation's close cousin, communications, is undergoing remarkable improvements. The Clinton administration and others are promoting <b>information</b> <b>superhighways,</b> and many proponents claim that such superhighways will spawn technological improvements. Might transportation experiences illuminate those claims...|$|E

40|$|In {{these days}} of {{healthcare}} reform, there is an increasing need to control the costs of medical care. Preventive medical care can help by providing information to the patient, not only for illnesses, but for prevention and wellness. "Information Therapy" is a new term for supplying patients with health information, enabling them {{to make informed decisions}} about their health and care, participate in their own well-being, and thus decrease the utilization of healthcare resources. The formal definition for Information Therapy is presented and the basis for defining it lies in bibliotherapy, patient education, consumer health trends, patient's rights, and the Freedom of Information Act. The parameters and coverage of Information Therapy are discussed, the roles that Information Therapy can play in healthcare are explored, and the dual nature of its goals is presented. Barriers to its implementation are listed, however, the electronic age with its <b>information</b> <b>superhighways</b> is expected to provide a unique delivery system for Information Therapy...|$|E
