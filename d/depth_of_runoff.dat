All of these problems have been observed in the Bay. Two agricultural fields (the Marchand and Gagnon sites) located on the Pike River watershed, in southeastern Quebec were selected and equipped with instrumentation to measure and evaluate the partitioning of phosphorus between surface runoff and subsurface drainage, on a year round basis.

Both equations form a system of nonlinear partial differential equations with two unknown functions expressing the <b>depth</b> and velocity <b>of</b> the movement of water along the slope, in dependence on their location on the slope, and time. The input variables of the model are the intensity and direction of the impinging raindrops, the intensity of infiltration and the physical characteristics of the slope (gradient, length and properties of soil surface). Extensive laboratory experiments have been carried out to determine the functional dependence of tangential stress on the <b>depth</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> from different types of soil surfaces.

The rainfall and runoff data has been collected from the gauging stations of the basin apart from rainfall data from nearby stations. MNRCS-CN method has been adopted to calculate runoff.

In this study, a semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model (SWAT-Soil Water Assessment Tool) {{coupled with a}} glacier melting algorithm was applied to investigate the sensitivity of streamflow to climatic and glacial changes in the upstream Heihe River Basin. The glacier mass balance was calculated at daily time-step using a distributed temperature-index melting and accumulation algorithm embedded in the SWAT model. Specifically, the model was calibrated and validated using daily streamflow data measured at Yingluoxia Hydrological Station and decadal ice volume changes derived from survey maps and remote sensing images between 1960 and 2010. This study highlights the effects of glacier melting on streamflow and their future changes in the mountainous watersheds. We simulate the contribution of glacier melting to streamflow change under different scenarios of climate changes in terms of temperature and precipitation dynamics. The rising temperature positively contributed to streamflow due to the increase of snowmelt and glacier melting. The rising precipitation directly contributes to streamflow and it contributed more to streamflow than the rising temperature. The results show that glacial meltwater has contributed about 3. 25 billion m(3) to streamflow during 1960 - 2010. However, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> within the watershed increased by about 2. 3 mm due {{to the release of}} water from glacial storage to supply the intensified evapotranspiration and infiltration. The simulation results indicate that the glacier made about 8. 9 % contribution to streamflow in 2010.

Analysis of runoff and peaks therein is {{essential}} for designing hydraulic infrastructures and for assessing the hydrological implications of likely scenarios of climate and/or land-use change. Different methods are available to calculate runoff coefficients. For instance, the runoff coefficient of a catchment can be described either as the ratio of total <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> to total depth of rainfall or as the ratio of peak flow to rainfall intensity for the time of concentration (Dhakal et al. 2012). If the first definition is considered, runoff coefficients represent the global effect of different features and states of catchments and its determination requires a suitable analysis according to the objectives pursued (Chow et al., 1988). In this work, rainfall-runoff data and physical attributes from small rural catchments located in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) were examined in order to compare the representative values of runoff coefficients using three different approaches: i) statistical analysis of rainfall-runoff data and their quantiles (Dhakal et al., 2012); ii) probabilistic runoff coefficients from the rank-ordered pairs of observed rainfall-runoff data and their relationships with rainfall depths (Schaake et al., 1967); iii) finally, a multiple linear model based on geomorphological attributes. These catchments exhibit great variety {{with respect to their}} natural settings, such as climate, topography and lithology. We present a preliminary analysis of the rainfall-runoff relationships as well as their variability in a com- plex context such as the Iberian Peninsula where contrasted environmental systems coexist.

This study is conceived as the first step to explore further working protocols and modeling gaps in a very susceptible area to the climate change such as the Iberian Peninsula′s, where the analysis of runoff coefficients is crucial for designing appropriate decision making tools for water management.

40|$|The {{application}} of substantial quantities of phosphorus (P) has {{been required to}} increase productivity on many Australian soils. Unfortunately, these applications have often resulted in increased concentrations of P in surface runoff that contributes to excessive algal growth in surface waters and consequently a decline in their quality. The concentrations of P in runoff from intensively managed pastures are often high (1 - 5 mg/L) and typically at least {{an order of magnitude}} higher than water quality targets. Although a substantial amount of research has been devoted to the problem of P accumulation and mobilisation in arable systems (in which P is typically mobilised by the action of raindrop impact and subsequently transported in particulate form), there has been substantially less research in intensively managed pasture systems. Consequently, there is a paucity of knowledge concerning the fundamental processes and factors responsible for P in runoff from these systems and a dearth of truly effective remedial strategies. In this thesis, the accumulation of P in soil under intensively managed pastures used for dairying and the processes responsible for its mobilisation in surface runoff were investigated. This research was undertaken at two research sites in South - east Australia, i. e. Camden in New South Wales and Flaxley in South Australia. A number of factors relating to scale and hydrology may influence the processes of P mobilisation and its concentration in runoff. A comparison was made of the forms and concentrations of P in runoff between a typical rainfall simulation methodology and large runoff plots. The effect of rainfall intensity on the forms and concentrations of P was also investigated. The concentrations of P in runoff from small - scale, high - intensity rainfall simulations were on average 33 % lower than those from large plots (approximating hillslopes) although the processes of mobilisation (as evidenced by runoff P forms) were similar. Increasing rainfall intensity resulted in decreasing P concentrations, but similar forms of P. It was hypothesised that changes in hydrological characteristics (residence time and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>runoff)</b> were responsible for the differences in the P concentrations. A model of P mobilisation (incorporating hydrological and P - release characteristics) was developed and shown to successfully predict runoff P concentrations under a range of rainfall intensities. These findings and the subsequent model were used in the successful modelling of landscape scale nutrient exports based on rainfall simulation data as part of a separate, but complementary project. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that Australian soils are relatively ' leaky ' in terms of P in runoff compared to soils overseas. Consequently, comparisons of the labile soil P characteristics and soil P - runoff P relationships were made between Australian soils and soils of similar fertility from the USA, UK and New Zealand (using both experimental data and data sourced from the literature). It was concluded that Australian soils leak more P than soils of similar fertility in the USA, UK and New Zealand, although it was beyond the scope of the thesis to make more detailed comparisons between Australian and overseas soils. The accumulation and mobilisation of P in two soils used for intensive pasture production in Australia were investigated. In intensive pasture systems P accumulated in the shallowest zones of the soil and principally as inorganic P. The concentrations of labile P were 3 - 5 times higher in the top 0. 01 m than in the top 0. 1 m. Using a simple model, it was estimated that only the top several mm of soil influence runoff P concentrations. The dominant form of P in runoff was shown to be orthophosphate although in low to moderate fertility soils, dissolved organic P can constitute a substantial proportion of the P in runoff. These results confirm the need to reduce the pool of P available for mobilisation in the immediate topsoil in order to reduce runoff P concentrations. Because P is stratified, it was hypothesised that one method to reduce the pool of P available for mobilisation is to de - stratify the soil (i. e. mix the topsoil). The effect of this technique on runoff P concentrations was investigated in laboratory and rainfall simulation experiments. These experiments revealed that reductions in runoff P concentrations between 45 and 70 % can be achieved by de - stratification of soils under permanent pastures. It was hypothesised that the benefits of de - stratification could be maximised using a combination of information relating to catchment hydrology and the spatial distribution of soil P and that this would result in large reductions in P exports with a relatively small degree of inconvenience to land managers. Given the limited opportunities identified in previous research to reduce P exports in runoff, the strategic utilisation of de - stratification is a potentially important option in water quality management for the dairy industry and warrants further investigation.

Treatments consisted of four simulated rainfall tests at different times, with a planned intensity of 64 mm h- 1 and 90 min duration. The first test was applied 18 days after sowing, and the others at 39, 75 and 120 days after the first test. Different times of the simulated rainfall and stages of the crop cycle affected soil water content prior to the rain, and the time runoff began and its peak flow and, thus, the surface hydrological processes. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runoff</b> and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the water intercepted by the crop + soil infiltration + soil surface storage were affected by the crop systems and the rainfall applied at different times. The corn crop was the most effective treatment for controlling runoff, with a water loss ratio of 0. 38, equivalent to 75 % of the water loss ratio exhibited by common bean (0. 51), the least effective treatment in relation to the others. Total water loss by runoff decreased linearly with an increase in the time that <b>runoff</b> began, regardless <b>of</b> the treatment; however, soil water content on the gravimetric basis increased linearly from the beginning to the end of the rainfall...|$|R

Hence, precise assessment of floods becomes a more vital demand in development planning. A GIS-based methodology {{has been developed}} for quantifying and spatially mapping the flood characteristics. The core of this new approach is integrating several topographic, metrological, geological, and land use datasets in a GIS environment that utilizes the Curve Number (CN) method of flood modelling for ungauged arid catchments. Additionally, the computations of flood quantities, such as <b>depth</b> and volume <b>of</b> <b>runoff,</b> are performed in the attribute tables of GIS layers, in order to assemble all results in the same environment. The accomplished {{results show that the}} runoff depth in Makkah, using a 50 -years return period, range from 128. 1 mm to 193. 9 mm while the peak discharge vary from 1063 m 3 /s to 4489 m 3 /s. The total flood volume is expected to reach 172. 97 million m 3 over Makkah metropolitan area. The advantages of the developed methodology include precision, cost-effective, digital outputs, and its ability to be re-run in other conditions...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Current public perceptions of herbicide effects on water quality make it important to document them wherever possible. Objectives of this study were to determine if herbicides used for brush control influence: 1) vegetation composition, 2) amount <b>of</b> <b>runoff,</b> sediment, and nutrients produced, and 3) amount <b>of</b> herbicide in <b>runoff.</b> Research was conducted on the Senesa Ranch located 56 km west southwest of San Antonio, Texas, in the northern Rio Grande Plains resource region. Nine watersheds were instrumented to collect samples for water quality analysis, stage recorders monitored <b>depth</b> and duration <b>of</b> <b>runoff,</b> and vegetation cover was monitored using three 3 O m line transects within each watershed. Three watersheds were treated with an aqueous solution of picloram and triclopyr (0. 56 kg ha- 1) in October, 1992, three with a pelleted formulation of tebuthiuron (2. 2 kg ha- 1) in March, 1992, and three left untreated. Both picloram/triclopyr and tebuthiuron applications were found to alter vegetation composition. For the 30 month period of the study brush cover declined 28 % and 40 %, with an increase in perennial grass cover of 230 % and 285 % on the piclorarn/tticlopyr and tebuthiuron treatments, respectively. Herbicide applications caused a significant decrease in <b>runoff</b> and production <b>of</b> water quality parameters. On the picloram/triclopyr watersheds, runoff decreased 79 %, sediment production 89 %, and nitrates 70 %. On the tebuthiuron watersheds, runoff decreased 38 %, sediment production 76 %, and nitrates 97 %. Water samples were analyzed for picloram and triclopyr. Herbicide concentrations during the first runoff event 23 days after application were 151 and 142 mg L- 1 for picloram and triclopyr respectively. These levels are substantially below 500 mg L- 1, the allowable picloram level set for drinking water standards by the United States EPA. Within eight months picloram levels declined to less than 5 mg L- 1, and triclopyr was undetectable (< 2 mg L- 1). By 18 months picloram levels were at or below detection limit (1 mg L- 1). Results indicate that vegetation response to herbicides utilized for brush control reduce water yield in the form <b>of</b> <b>runoff,</b> and may reduce the potential for non-point source pollution from South Texas Rangeland...|$|R

For finding the current status and major problems of SFR, the typical watershed in RSC is selected to make field investigation. Then, based on the present technologies and methods <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> regulation, the integrated process analysis system <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> regulation and control technology and strategy (IPASRRCTS) is originally developed, which includes requirement estimate, potential analysis, benefit evaluation. In addition, it also includes specific designation and distribution of RRCTS.

40|$|Mathematical and {{computerized}} {{models are}} developed {{to design and}} optimize furrow irrigation systems. The optimization process starts with land grading design, if any is needed, followed by a prediction of maximum non-erosive furrow stream size allowed on a given soil and the associated furrow-advance function. An average <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> application per irrigation is then assumed from which the wetting pattern along the furrow and the amounts <b>of</b> <b>runoff</b> water are predicted. A design <b>of</b> an Irrigation <b>Runoff</b> Recovery System, IRRS, is then executed, if desired, and system cost is determined. Using the predicted wetting pattern and the appropriate Crop Production Function, the gross return and the net farm profit associated with that particular average <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> application per irrigation are determined. The iterative procedure is continued by changing the average <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> application per irrigation and evaluating net farm profit until a depth and the associated system design and management program which yield the highest net profit are found. A Fortran IV detailed computer program is developed to perform the above procedure. The program is comprehensive and very flexible {{so that it can}} be used both for research and practical design purposes and can accommodate further improvements and expansion. The results of sensitivity analysis conducted to study the effect on net farm profit of ten major design and management factors are included.
