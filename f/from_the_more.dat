5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Baird was {{the first}} cabinet {{minister}} to support Jim Flaherty's campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party's 2002 leadership election. The election was won by Flaherty's rival Ernie Eves, and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier's cabinet in April 2002. He was not, but was demoted {{to the position of}} Chief Government Whip while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs. His replacement in Social Services was Brenda Elliott, who was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.|$|E
5|$|Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties {{had turned}} away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> feudal {{culture of the}} {{preceding}} Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system {{was supported by a}} large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, Daoism and Buddhism reigned as core ideologies as well, and played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.|$|E

However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E

5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, {{but only the}} latter is fissile. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for uranium enrichment, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E

5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious movements in the United States.

From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|The West Coast offices {{had wanted}} {{a test case}} to take to court, but had a {{difficult}} time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> conservative Fraenkel and another <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> putative Wayne Collins.|$|E
