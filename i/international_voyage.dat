500|$|On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter {{proposed}} {{to the president}} a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian political group, the United States would negotiate with [...] "moderate" [...] members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so {{with the hope of}} the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another <b>international</b> <b>voyage,</b> this one to Tehran; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan; and, according to George Cave a cake baked {{in the shape of a}} key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. He met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages. [...] The American delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA agent who worked in Iran in the 1960s–70s), Teicher, an Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator [...] arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane's disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words [...] "third and fourth level officials". At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: [...] "As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, you can work with my staff". The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the United States rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.|$|E

50|$|His legacy remains important. By 1947, when India became independent, the Walchand {{group of}} {{companies}} {{was one of the}} ten largest business houses in the country. The first Indian ship SS Loyalty made its maiden <b>international</b> <b>voyage</b> on 5 April 1919 by sailing from Mumbai to London. Walchand Hirachand was personally present on the ship. After India became independent, 5 April has been declared the National Maritime Day to honour that voyage. While Walchand pioneered a role for India in several industries, his dependence on excessive leverage and nationalisation seem to have taken the sheen off his contributions. The car factory, while the first in India, trailed the Birlas' Hindustan Motors in terms of market share. Walchandnagar Industries Limited, located at Walchandnagar, an industrial township near Pune is today a strategic defence and nuclear equipments manufacturing company. Absence of direct male heirs may also have had a role {{in the nature of the}} businesses left behind by him. For Walchand, industry was probably not just a place to make money but also to have adventure. For example, a visit to Hollywood inspired him to construct a huge studio now known as Walchand Studio in India for which he was earlier in talks with the famous Bollywood producer-director V. Shantaram without a tangible result. However, for years to come, he would probably be remembered as the man who dared to dream and was able to materialise most of his dreams into reality by his steadfastness and willpower.|$|E
5000|$|In Honolulu, Kāne {{attracted}} {{a group of}} sailing enthusiasts, including University of Hawaii anthropologist Ben Finney and Tommy Holmes, author of The Hawaiian Canoe. Together they founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society and began work on the Hōkūle‘a, a voyaging canoe based on historical Polynesian design, capable of sailing between Hawaii and Tahiti. Their purpose was to prove that ancestral Polynesian voyagers could have purposely navigated in vessels of similar type to colonize Hawaii. Kāne has said his goal was also to spur a revival of cultural identity among Hawaiians and peoples of the Pacific islands. He wrote that in 1973 he, {{with a number of}} others at the time, realized that “if a voyaging canoe were built and sailed today, it would function as a cultural catalyst and inspire the revival of almost-forgotten aspects of Hawaiian life.” [...] "What intrigued me was to see, if by building this canoe and putting it to active use and taking it out on a cruise throughout the Hawaiian islands, introducing it to the Hawaiian people, training Hawaiians to sail it, if this would not stimulate shock waves or ripple effect throughout the culture- in music and dance and the crafts. And we know it did.”Kāne designed and named the Hōkūle‘a, which was launched on March 8, 1975. Technically, the craft is a performance-accurate full-scale replica of a waʻa kaulua, a Polynesian double-hulled voyaging canoe. The name Hōkūle‘a came to Kāne in a dream, he has said. It is the Hawaiian term for the star Arcturus, which is of critical importance to celestial navigation in the Pacific, and the zenith star of the Hawaiian Islands. He served as the skipper for two years as the canoe sailed trial cruises among the Hawaiian Islands to attract crew and support for its maiden <b>international</b> <b>voyage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOur coastal waters are the United States’ most open and vulnerable borders. This vast maritime domain harbors critical threats from terrorism, criminal activities, and natural disasters. Maritime borders pose significant security challenges, as nefarious entities have used small boats to conduct illegal activities for years, {{and they continue}} to do so today. Illegal drugs, money, weapons, and migrants flow both directions across our maritime borders, as vessels can quickly complete these transits without detection. To what extent could Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology improve border security against the small vessel threat? This thesis provides an overview of existing AIS systems and reviews the maritime border security effectiveness and cost benefit impacts of potential AIS equipment carriage requirements. We compared and analyzed policy options and reviewed implementation issues and concerns. Our conclusions are that the Department of Homeland Security should implement a regulation for all vessels, regardless of size, to install and broadcast Class A or Class B AIS when conducting international voyages. The proposed regulation would expand the existing Small Vessel Reporting System to a mandatory program wherein mariners are required to preregister and file float plans prior to conducting an <b>international</b> <b>voyage.</b> This proposed action provides direct support to three of the five basic homeland security missions: prevent terrorism and enhance security, secure and manage our borders, and enforce and administer our immigration laws.
