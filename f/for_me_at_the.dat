25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The reason I was using that concept so much {{at that point in}} my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{potential}} for controversy, Liszt wrote, [...] "The barometer is hardly set on praise <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." [...] Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term [...] "Sinfonische Dichtung" [...] contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, [...] "This morning [...] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called musictoilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [...] G Major String Sextet." [...] Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his [...] "Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems". Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics: ...|$|E
500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that things seem to be going well <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E

2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for anything else. I was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it {{was so great that}} he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E
2500|$|After {{more than}} two weeks, the clubs had agreed a fee for him, and on 16 January 2012 Cahill signed for Chelsea for what was {{believed}} to be around the region of £7million, and the negotiating of personal terms. Cahill told the club's official website, [...] "Chelsea is a massive club, it is a club that looks to win trophies season in season out and it is a big opportunity for me {{to be a part of}} that. Opportunities like this you can't turn down." [...] He also thanked his former club and their fans, saying, [...] "This is the right move <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right time and I would like to thank everyone at Bolton because I've had a great four years at the football club. My spell with Wanderers has enabled me to break into the England squad, and I would particularly like to thank the fans for their support along the way. I always appreciated their backing." [...] He was one of Chelsea's unused substitutes in their 1–0 away victory in the 2011–12 FA Cup against Queens Park Rangers on 28 January 2012. On 5 February, Cahill made his debut for Chelsea in the 3–3 draw against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. On 18 March 2012, he scored his first goal in a Chelsea shirt against Leicester City in the FA Cup, a 5–2 win. Cahill scored when he rose above Wes Morgan to head the ball from six yards from a Juan Mata corner, before unveiling the word's [...] "PRAY 4 MUAMBA" [...] on his inner T-shirt, in support of his former Bolton teammate Fabrice Muamba, who had collapsed in a match the day before. He scored his first league goal for the club in the following match, opening the scoring in a 2–1 away defeat to Manchester City.|$|E
