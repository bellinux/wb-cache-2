But what happens, if the robot <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and thereby still <b>has</b> <b>to</b> react on user commands? In this case, the robot <b>has</b> <b>to</b> find a good position where the user can still be observed, and the robot does not disturb the user’s activities. Such a position <b>has</b> <b>to</b> fulfill different criteria: first, to guarantee the observability of {{the person with the}} robots on-board sensors and second, the robot should be able to observe the person when the person changes its position at its resting place.

I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story."

I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything.
