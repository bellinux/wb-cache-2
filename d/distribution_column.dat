These measurements support the theory that x rays can be focused using a boro-silicate array of polycapillaries consisting of 258 bundles with 1387 micro- channels each. A 90 MeV electron beam incident upon a non-resonant mylar stack formed transition radiation spatially distributed in an annular cone. The electron beam was deflected 30 degrees using a rare earth permanent magnet. The diverging x-rays incident upon the lens array were transported through total external reflection and directed out of the array onto a phosphor screen. A digital camera recorded the phosphorescing image of the screen. Pixel intensity was analyzed to determine x ray intensity {{as a function of}} two dimensional spatial <b>distribution.</b> <b>Column</b> average profiles of the pixel intensity show that the transition radiation intensity retains its Gaussian distribution after being redirected from a diverging beam into a mostly parallel beam.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel image watermarking technique using Kekre’s algorithm to generate hybrid wavelet transform DKT_DCT from Kekre transform and Discrete Cosine Transform. In the proposed technique, 256 x 256 hybrid transform is generated using 16 x 16 Kekre transform and 16 x 16 DCT whereas, 128 x 128 hybrid wavelet transform is generated using 32 x 32 Kekre transform and 4 x 4 DCT matrix. Generated DKT_DCT transform {{is applied to}} host and watermark in three different ways: column wise, row wise and full transform. Performances of these three ways of applying transform are compared against various image processing attacks namely image cropping, image compression, adding noise and image resizing attacks. Column DKT_DCT transform is most robust for compression and resizing attack whereas row DKT_DCT wavelet transform is most robust for cropping, JPEG compression attack and binary distributed run length noise attack for increased run length. Column and row DKT_DCT transform show exceptionally better performance than full DKT_DCT wavelet transform. Also column DKT_DCT transform is observed {{to be better than}} column DCT wavelet transform for above mentioned attacks and row DKT_DCT wavelet is better than row DCT wavelet for binary distributed run length noise attack showing the strength of hybrid wavelet transform over wavelet transform generated from same component orthogonal transform matrices.

This survey examines 432 VLT/UVES spectra from the UVES SQUAD collaboration and 170 Keck/HIRES spectra from the KODIAQ group, allowing for detections of intervening absorbers spanning redshifts 0. 1 < z < 2. 6. We employ an accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects redshifted absorption lines. We measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical depth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. Using our complete sample of all detectable absorbers, we can accurately determine the redshift path density of absorbers across cosmic time. We measure evolution in the comoving line density, dN /dX, finding more high equivalent width absorbers at z = 2 than at present. We also measure evolution in the equivalent width distribution, parameterized by a Schechter function fit, finding a shallower weak-end slope for absorbers at redshifts between 1. 53 < z < 2. 64 as compared to lower redshifts. Finally, we calculate the cosmic mass fraction of using the column density distribution. We find that weak absorbers, those with equivalent widths less than 0. 3 Å, are physically distinct and evolve separately from very strong absorbers, which have equivalent widths greater than 1. 0 Å.

40|$|Modern {{devices for}} thermal energy {{measurement}} and accounting are rarely available in historical buildings, despite energy consumptions are not negligible. On the other hand, historical buildings exhibit architectural constraints and plant configurations that strongly discourage {{the use of}} direct heat meters, both on a technical and economic point of view. In such context, the "individual" accounting of thermal energy in household applications (heating, cooling, hot water) represent a very essential tool for increasing energy efficiency in buildings in which a centralized heating/cooling plant is available. In fact, merely sharing the costs of thermal energy {{as a function of}} the real consumptions of each user can be a strong incentive to adopt energy-saving behaviors. Furthermore, the availability of real time energy consumptions data about, typical of a “smart” metering architecture, enables the users to identify the causes of any waste of energy and consequently adopt adequate strategies to improve energy efficiency. Finally, the ability to adjust thermal energy consumption curve in the logic of "demand-side management" could be encouraged.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the two-dimensional (R, Z) distribution of molecules in circumstellar disks around young stellar objects. In the Z-direction, the disk can be schematically {{divided into three}} layers: the midplane, the outermost surface region, and the intermediate region. On the midplane, in cool outer regions of a disk, most of the molecules are adsorbed onto grains {{within a short time}} and depleted from the gas phase owing to the high density. As the height Z increases, the density decreases and the time scale for adsorption of molecules onto the dust particles increases. At the outermost surface regions, on the other hand, molecules are dissociated by UV radiation. Hence, in disks with a typical age (10 5 – 10 6 yr), molecular abundances have their peak values at some intermediate region. The height at which the abundances reach their peak values varies with species. Radicals, such as CN and C 2 H, have their peaks at larger heights Z than more stable species such as HCN and NH 3. At significant distances from the midplane, the chemistry is also affected by a higher ionization rate due to X-rays, if the central star is a strong X-ray emitter, while, in the midplane, cosmic-rays are the main sources of ionization. The abundances of some species (e. g. HCN) are enhanced by a higher ionization rate. Integrating molecular abundances perpendicular to the midplane, we obtain column densities for molecules, and their radial <b>distribution.</b> <b>Column</b> densities of selected molecules such as HNC and NH 3 are particularly sensitive to the total column density of the disk and the variation in UV radiation field due to the growth and sedimentation of dust particles.

The KBSS is optimized for the redshift range z ∼ 2 - 3, combining S/N ∼ 100 Keck/HIRES spectra of 15 of the brightest QSOs in the sky at z ≃ 2. 5 - 2. 9 with very densely sampled galaxy redshift surveys within a few arcmin of each QSO sightline.

Using Voigt profile decompositions of the full Lyα forest region of all 15 QSO spectra, we compiled a catalog of ∼ 6000 individual absorbers in the redshift range of interest, with 12 ≤ log(N_(HI)) ≤ 21. These are used to measure H I absorption statistics near the redshifts of foreground galaxies as a function of projected galactocentric distance from the QSO sightline and for randomly chosen locations in the intergalacticmedium (IGM) within the survey volume. We find that NHI and the multiplicity of velocity-associated H I components increase rapidly with decreasing galactocentric impact parameter and as the systemic redshift of the galaxy is approached. The strongest H_I absorbers within ≃ 100 physical kpc of galaxies have N_(HI) ∼ 3 orders of magnitude higher than those near random locations in the IGM.

40|$|Purpose: Re-vegetation is the {{preferred}} long-term practice for managing Alcoa's bauxite-processing residue storage areas. Residue sand is the primary growth medium for rehabilitation; however, it is largely nutrient deficient. Although addition of organic and inorganic amendments can provide short-term supply of plant-available nutrients, but quickly exhausted, thus long-term deficiencies are often observed. The rapid transformation of added zinc into non-available pools is predicted as the main factor limiting vegetation performance. Materials and methods: Two laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the effect of organic (composts) and inorganic (various types of red mud) amendments on Zn availability in residue sand. Three compost mixtures (piggery, biosolid and commercial compost), three rates of application (0, 10 and 50 t ha- 1) were taken as organic amendments and incubated with residue sand for 30 days {{to examine the effects}} of compost on Zn availability. Seven column treatments were set up as: control residue sand, homogeneous mixtures of residue sand with 3 % (w/w) and 8 % (w/w) seawater-washed, carbonated or unaltered red mud with residue sand. Leaching with distilled water was carried out every 3 days by adding 1 / 6 th pore volume and analysed for Zn availability and its distribution in various chemical pools. Results and discussion: Fractionation studies found that Zn availability decreased with incubation time and red mud amendments. Residue pH and organic C were the major factors controlling Zn availability and its <b>distribution.</b> <b>Column</b> studies showed limited Zn mobility in residue sand even after three pore volumes of drainage. Increased DTPA extractable Zn in surface layers of residue sand with and without red mud amendments after leaching was found and attributed to decrease in residue water-soluble alkalinity. Addition of commercial compost (50 t ha- 1) increased DTPA Zn, decreased the alkalinity and increased C content in residue sand. The red mud amendments had contrasting effects on Zn that were related to pH of the materials. Addition of seawater-washed red mud increased DTPA Zn in residue sand whereas unaltered red mud decreased DTPA Zn. Conclusions: Plant available Zn extracted with 50 t ha- 1 of commercial composts addition was well above deficient range, suggesting that they could be an effective Zn source for vegetation establishment. Zinc occurred predominantly in organically bound form in compost-amended sand and as carbonate-bound form in leached red mud-amended columns, but the longer term effects of these Zn forms on the release of Zn for plant growth remain unclear...|$|E

These measurements are derived from Voigt profile decomposition of the full Ly&# 945; and Ly&# 946; forest in 15 high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio QSO spectra resulting in a catalog of &# 8764; 6000 HI absorbers. Chapter 2 of this thesis focuses on HI surrounding high-z star-forming galaxies drawn from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). The KBSS is a unique spectroscopic survey of the distant universe designed to explore {{the details of the}} connection between galaxies and intergalactic baryons within the same survey volumes. The KBSS combines high-quality background QSO spectroscopy with large densely-sampled galaxy redshift surveys to probe the CGM at scales of &# 8764; 50 kpc to a few Mpc. Based on these data, Chapter 2 presents the first quantitative {{measurements of}} the <b>distribution,</b> <b>column</b> density, kinematics, and absorber line widths of neutral hydrogen surrounding high-z star-forming galaxies. Chapter 3 focuses on the thermal properties of the diffuse IGM. This analysis relies on {{measurements of the}} &# 8764; 6000 absorber line widths to constrain the thermal and turbulent velocities of absorbing "clouds. " A positive correlation between the column density of HI and the minimum line width is recovered and implies a temperature-density relation within the low-density IGM for which higher-density regions are hotter, as is predicted by simple theoretical arguments. Chapter 4 presents new measurements of the opacity of the IGM and CGM to hydrogen-ionizing photons. The chapter begins with a revised measurement of the HI column density distribution based on this new absorption line catalog that, due to the inclusion of high-order Lyman lines, provides the first statistically robust measurement of the frequency of absorbers with HI column densities 14 ≲ log(N HI /cm - 2) ≲ 17. 2. Also presented are the first measurements of the column density distribution of HI within the CGM (50 <d < 300 pkpc) of high-z galaxies. These distributions are used to calculate the total opacity of the IGM and IGM+CGM and to revise previous measurements of the mean free path of hydrogen-ionizing photons within the IGM. This chapter also considers the effect of the surrounding CGM on the transmission of ionizing photons out of the sites of active star-formation and into the IGM. This thesis concludes with a brief discussion of work in progress focused on understanding the distribution of metals within the CGM of KBSS galaxies.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Existing {{correlations}} {{developed to}} account for pressure drop and velocity distribution in packed beds are not ideal for beds with low aspect ratios. This study investigated a method to model flow <b>distribution</b> through packed <b>columns</b> by performing numerical analysis using an explicit approach. Fixed random packed beds for column–to–sphere diameter ratios of 1. 39 Master...|$|R
40|$|To ensure and {{increase}} the hygiene and sanitary comfort degree in buildings older than 25 years, rehabilitation and modernization of water supply indoor installations is required. The rate at which these capital repairs {{were made to the}} common facilities is very low, which explains the increasing number of commercial buildings that claims flooded basements due to rusty, clogged or broken pipes. In this regard, the paper analyzes the situation of an apartment building, located in Timisoara, which is 48 years old and to which were made only partial rehabilitation works. The solutions resulted from the performed analysis lead to the necessity of performing the rehabilitation and modernization works by replacing the installation <b>distribution</b> and <b>columns</b> that shows a high wear and clogging degree...|$|R
40|$|Absorption {{lines of}} OVII at {{redshift}} zero are observed in high quality Chandra spectra of extragalactic sightlines. The {{location of the}} absorber producing these lines, whether from the corona of the Galaxy or from the Local Group or even larger scale structure, has {{been a matter of}} debate. Here we study another poor group like our Local Group to understand the <b>distribution</b> of <b>column</b> density from galaxy to group scales. We show that we cannot yet rule out the group origin of z= 0 systems. We further argue that the debate over Galactic vs. extragalactic origin of z= 0 systems is premature as they likely contain both components and predict that future higher resolution observations will resolve the z= 0 systems into multiple components.
