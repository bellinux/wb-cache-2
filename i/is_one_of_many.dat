5|$|Gedi <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> medieval Swahili-Arab coastal {{settlements}} {{that stretch}} from Mogadishu, Somalia to the Zambezi River in Mozambique. There are 116 known Swahili sites stretching from southern Somalia to Vumba Kuu at the Kenya-Tanzania border. Since the rediscovery of the Gedi ruins by colonialists the 1920s, Gedi {{has been one}} of the most intensely excavated and studied of those sites, along with Shanga, Manda, Ungwana, Kilwa, and the Comoros.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

5|$|Allow Me, {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. The sculpture, one of seven Allow Me casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, hailing a cab and holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, the sculpture stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds.

5|$|Berlioz's version <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> which {{combine the}} Italian and French scores, {{although}} {{it is the most}} influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
5|$|Link also enters {{this mode}} when {{attacked}} by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health. This separate method of traveling and entering combat <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> aspects adapted from the role-playing video game genre. Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map will automatically switch the game to a side-scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup.|$|E
5|$|Pevensey Castle was reoccupied between 1940 and 1945, {{during the}} Second World War, {{when it was}} garrisoned by units from the Home Guard, the British and Canadian armies and the United States Army Air Corps. Machine-gun posts were built into the Roman and Norman walls to control the flat land around Pevensey and guard against {{the threat of a}} German invasion. They were left in place after the war and can still be seen today. Pevensey <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> norman castles built around the south of England.|$|E

The more {{prominent}} hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill {{at the lower end}} of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawn}} {{and mysterious}} pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, is a clone {{made from the}} salvaged remains of Yui and is plagued {{by a sense of}} negative self-worth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset. She at one time despised Shinji for his lack of trust in his father Gendo, with whom Rei is very close. However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series it is revealed that she <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.|$|E
5|$|Trinity Grammar School in Prospect Road is {{a private}} school {{catering}} for students from PreK to Year 12. The schools's site has been in continuous use for education for 120 years. The headmaster's house at Trinity was erected circa 1877. The site operated as several different teaching institutions until it was purchased by the Anglican Church, becoming known as Trinity Grammar School in 1925. Trinity Grammar <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> wealthy schools in New South Wales, and has previously received {{some of the largest}} government subsidies, when comparing total government subsidies per school. An expansion plan by Trinity involving the demolition of houses in nearby Seaview Street caused controversy in 2007. The development was nonetheless approved by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.|$|E

5|$|On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson's former camp at Gilbert Town, where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them, {{anxious for}} action. On October 6, they reached Cowpens, South Carolina, (site {{of the future}} Battle of Cowpens), where they {{received}} word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him. Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men. Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day's march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements. Kings Mountain <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow instep, and a broad rounded toe. The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle, the highest point on Kings Mountain.|$|E
