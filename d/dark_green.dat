5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, rock pipit and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are a <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> but are often {{speckled}} with light brown or black.

5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes <b>dark</b> <b>green,</b> signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
5|$|B.sessilis var. cordata was {{published}} as Dryandra floribunda var. cordata by Carl Meissner in 1848. In 1870, George Bentham published D.floribunda var. major, {{but this is}} now considered a taxonomic synonym of B.sessilis var. cordata. It has larger inflorescences than var. sessilis, as well as larger <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> rather than blue green leaves. It {{is found in the}} state's far southwest, between Capes Leeuwin and Naturaliste, and east to Walpole, and grows on sandy soils over limestone.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E

5|$|Generally, the {{convective}} outlook boundaries or lines – general thunderstorms (light green), marginal (<b>dark</b> <b>green),</b> slight (yellow), enhanced (orange), moderate (red) {{and high}} (purple) – will be continued as an arrow or line not filled with color if the risk area enters another country (Canada or Mexico) or across waters beyond the United States coastline. This {{indicates that the}} risk for severe weather is also valid in that general area {{of the other side}} of the border or oceanic boundary.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear <b>dark</b> <b>green,</b> but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and {{photographs from the}} time of opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The main body of the bridge was painted in <b>dark</b> <b>green,</b> with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E

There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{can form}} {{a great variety}} of suboxides with the metals in formal {{oxidation}} states below +1. Rubidium can form Rb6O and Rb9O2 (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs7O (bronze), Cs4O (red-violet), Cs11O3 (violet), Cs3O (<b>dark</b> <b>green),</b> CsO, Cs3O2, as well as Cs7O2. The last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate Cs2O.|$|E
