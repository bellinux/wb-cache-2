40|$|Abstract — <b>Plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> {{procedures}} {{provide a}} proficient and enduring way {{to enhance the}} facial appearance by correcting feature anomalies and treating facial skin to get a younger look. When an individual undergoes <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery,</b> the facial features are reconstructed either globally or locally. However, the variations introduced by <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> remain difficult to be modelled by existing face recognition systems and degrade the performances of face recognition algorithm. Therefore Facial <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> changes facial features to large extend and thus creating a major problem to face recognition system This paper proposes a new Multimodal Biometric approach using principle component analysis and local binary pattern feature extraction algorithm cascaded with periocular feature for <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> invariant face recognition. This method capable of extracting shape as well as texture features and improve the recognition rate using periocular biometric. The experiments conducted using non-surgery face database and <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> face database. On the <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> face database and non-surgery face database, the proposed algorithm yields high identification accuracy as compared to existing face recognition system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] <b>Plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{becoming}} prevalent due to advances in technology, {{and the speed}} with which these procedures are performed. Many efforts are being made by various researchers to address the challenges of human face detection and recognition. Variations in pose, expression, illumination, aging and disguise are the important challenges in this domain. Research focus is now shifted to <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> of human faces. In this paper, review of Perceptual resemblance of local <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> of facial images using Near Sets is proposed. We find different aspects related to <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> and face recognition. When an individual undergoes <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery,</b> the facial features are reconstructed in both ways either globally or locally. Generally, this process changes the appearance of an individual. As these procedures become more and more prevalent, future face recognition systems will be challenged to recognize individuals after <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> has been performed. However, to alleviate the problems of face recognition after local <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> of faces, we are using near set theory to identify resemblance between pre-surgical and post-surgical faces...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline in}} {{undergraduate}} teaching in <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> may affect student's decisions {{to pursue a}} career in the speciality and junior doctors may be insufficiently prepared for <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> rotations during foundation or core surgical training. To address this issue, we have developed a one-day Basic Surgical Skills and Principles in <b>Plastic</b> <b>Surgery</b> Course designed to provide medical students with the relevant skills and knowledge required for placements in <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> as junior doctors. A pre- and post-course questionnaire was used to record self-assessment of confidence in various domains. Our results show that students were significantly less confident in starting foundation training rotations in <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> (mean 3. 59, SD 1. 56) compared with general surgery (mean 5. 75, SD 1. 95) (p <  0. 0001), and ‘any specialty’ (mean 5. 88, SD 1. 54) (p <  0. 0001). However, a one-day course can significantly address this imbalance: 100 % increase in confidence in starting rotations in <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> (pre-course mean 3. 59 (SD 1. 56), post-course mean 7. 20 (SD 1. 60), p <  0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract—Advancement and {{affordability}} {{is leading}} to popularity of <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> procedures. Facial <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> can be reconstructive to correct facial feature anomalies or cosmetic to improve the appearance. Both corrective as well as cosmetic surgeries alter the original facial information {{to a great extent}} thereby posing a great challenge for face recognition algorithms. The contribution of this research is (i) preparing a face database of 900 individuals for <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery,</b> and (ii) providing an analytical and experimental underpinning of the effect of <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> on face recognition algorithms. The results on the <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> database suggest that it is an arduous research challenge and the current state-of-art face recognition algorithms are unable to provide acceptable levels of identification performance. Therefore, it is imperative to initiate a research effort so that future face recognition systems will be able to address this important problem.
