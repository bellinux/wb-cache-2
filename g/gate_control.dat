The water to the power house is supplied through five steel-lined tunnels of 30/26feet diameter. Each tunnel is designed to feed two generating units. The power house tailrace discharges into New Bong Canal, which has a length of 25,000feet with discharge capacity of about 49,000 cusecs, and terminates at an automatic <b>gate</b> <b>control</b> headworks at about 12km downstream located near old Bong Escape Headworks.|$|E
25|$|Very gently {{massaging}} {{the area}} and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the <b>gate</b> <b>control</b> theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until {{at least three days}} following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into {{the area and}} encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>gate</b> <b>control</b> {{theory of}} pain, {{proposed}} by Patrick David Wall and Ronald Melzack, postulates that nociception (pain) is [...] "gated" [...] by non-nociception stimuli such as vibration. Thus, rubbing a bumped knee seems to relieve pain by preventing its transmission to the brain. Pain is also [...] "gated" [...] by signals that descend {{from the brain}} to the spinal cord to suppress (and in other cases enhance) incoming nociception (pain) information.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is based}} on the {{competition}} of various gentle stimuli with pain transmission to the central nervous system: the so-called <b>gate</b> <b>control</b> theory of pain (proposed by Patrick David Wall and Ronald Melzack in 1965). Sensorial saturation follows a “3Ts” rule: using touch, taste and talk to distract the baby and antagonize pain. In babies treated with Sensorial Saturation, a reduction in crying time and pain score were noted, with respect to a control group and with respect to groups in which only oral sugar, only sucking, or {{a combination of the two}} was used. The [...] "3Ts" [...] stimuli (touch, talk, and taste)given throughout the painful procedure increase the well-known analgesic effect of oral sugar. Sensorial Saturation has been included in several international guidelines for analgesia ...|$|E
2500|$|Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray {{matter of}} the {{midbrain}} activates enkephalin-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT (serotonin) released from the raphe nuclei descends to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the [...] "inhibitory interneurons" [...] located in Laminae II (aka the substantia gelatinosa). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or dynorphin (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to mu opioid receptors on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from nociceptors activated in the periphery. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron {{that is responsible for}} transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The nociceptive signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as [...] "pain" [...] (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the <b>Gate</b> <b>control</b> theory of pain and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound analgesia. The periaqueductal gray is also activated by viewing distressing images associated with pain.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{data from}} Yokohama, Japan, {{showed that a}} {{macroscopic}} fundamental diagram (MFD) of urban traffic provides for different network regions a unimodal low-scatter relationship between network vehicle density and network space-mean flow. This provides new tools for network congestion control. Based on MFD, this paper proposed a feedback <b>gating</b> <b>control</b> policy {{which can be used}} to mitigate network congestion by adjusting signal timings of gating intersections. The objective of the feedback <b>gating</b> <b>control</b> model is to maximize the outflow and distribute the allowed inflows properly according to external demand and capacity of each gating intersection. An example network is used to test the performance of proposed feedback <b>gating</b> <b>control</b> model. Two types of background signalization types for the intersections within the test network, fixed-time and actuated control, are considered. The results of extensive simulation validate that the proposed feedback <b>gating</b> <b>control</b> model can get a Pareto improvement since the performance of both gating intersections and the whole network can be improved significantly especially under heavy demand situations. The inflows and outflows can be improved to a higher level, and the delay and queue length at all gating intersections are decreased dramatically...|$|R

5000|$|LSTM blocks contain {{three or}} four [...] "gates" [...] that control {{information}} flow. These gates are implemented using the logistic function to compute a value between 0 and 1.

30|$|The LSTM uses <b>gates</b> to <b>control</b> {{information}} flow and effectively creates shortcut paths across multiple temporal steps.

Each LSTM unit consists of one cell unit and four <b>control</b> <b>gates.</b> These <b>gates</b> <b>control</b> the input and output as well as the temporal extent of the memory cell through a forget gate.
