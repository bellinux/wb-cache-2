5|$|Local trains began {{serving the}} {{partially}} completed station from 2 October 1874, {{and it was}} fully opened on 1 November 1875, at a final cost of over £2million. The original City terminus at Bishopsgate closed to passengers and was converted {{for use as a}} <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> from 1881. This continued until it was destroyed by fire in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} at Southcote Manor stood {{until the}} 1960s, when a fire broke out. It was demolished by 1964 {{to make way}} for housing. Reading Central <b>Goods</b> <b>station</b> was closed in 1983, and with it the branch line from Southcote ceased to operate. Two years later the track bed and sleepers were removed.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime {{due to the}} large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The acting {{scene in}} Aarhus is diverse, with many groups and venues {{including}} Aarhus Teater, Svalegangen, EntréScenen, Katapult, Gruppe 38, Godsbanen, Helsingør Teater, Det Andet Teater and Teater Refleksion {{as well as}} several dance venues like Bora Bora and Granhøj Dans. The city hosts a biannual international theatre festival, International Living Theatre (ILT), the next event being scheduled for 2017. The former <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> of Aarhus Godsbanegård has recently been thoroughly renovated, redeveloped and expanded with a new building. Now known as Godsbanen, it functions as a cultural centre, and offers numerous workshops for the artist community and local citizens.|$|E
25|$|As {{goods are}} {{increasingly}} moved by road, many former <b>goods</b> <b>stations,</b> {{as well as}} the goods sheds at passenger stations, have closed. In addition, many <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations, where they primarily handle containers they are also known as container stations or terminals.|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Surrey Canal in 1811 changed the {{character}} of the road from rural to industrial. Tanneries were established along it and a soap processing plant was built. Older properties occupied by the upper and middle classes were converted into flats for the emerging working class population. By the time Bricklayers Arms <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> opened in 1845, the road was entirely built up and Old Kent Road had one of the highest population densities in Europe, with an average of 280 residents per acre. Sections along the road were commercial with various market stalls and sellers until the construction of the tramway in 1871. Camberwell Public Library No.1, which later became the Livesey Museum for Children was designed by Sir George Livesey in 1890. The road's southern section remained residential throughout the 19th century. Nos.864, 866 and 880–884 were constructed by John Lamb in 1815, and feature Ammonite capitals, ornamental features resembling fossils, a feature also used in contemporary architecture in Brighton.|$|E
25|$|A {{major source}} of traffic at the <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> was fresh fruit and vegetables, which would arrive at the station in the mornings, and be taken {{straight}} to the nearby market in the Bull Ring. The <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> was finally closed on 6 November 1972, and the main high-level shed was demolished three years later. The site of the former <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> is now partly occupied by the Selfridges Building, {{and some of the}} former low-level goods sheds are now used as a car-park.|$|E
25|$|Curzon Street {{railway station}} {{was a major}} railway station during the 19th century {{and served as a}} <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> with another {{terminus}} opposite. Unfortunately, it was located too far from the city centre and it was not successful. It failed as a passenger station and shut down in 1966 as a <b>goods</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>stations</b> {{were more}} {{widespread}} {{in the days when}} the railways were common carriers and were often converted from former passenger station whose traffic had moved elsewhere.|$|R

25|$|The LB {{inherited}} from the L running powers to the smaller SER passenger terminus at Bricklayers' Arms. Poorly sited for passengers, it closed in 1852 and was converted into a <b>goods</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|Below {{the train}} shed {{is an area}} once used as a <b>goods</b> <b>station.</b> Its cast iron columns and brick arches support the non-through {{platforms}} above. The area is now used by the Metrolink station, its tracks and sidings, as well as car parking. The columns were encased in concrete for protection against collision.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{providing}} services for passengers and loading facilities for <b>goods,</b> <b>stations</b> can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{increasing}} amount of goods traffic that has switched from rail to road many <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> and, in consequence marshalling yards, closed and were often eventually demolished, so that reviving rail services at the same location is no longer possible. In combined <b>goods</b> and hub <b>stations</b> with a hump yard, the latter was closed if the station lost {{its role as a}} railway hub, whilst the local goods function was retained. In addition, in most countries, part-load or parcel goods services have been entirely transferred to the roads, which has led to the closure of goods sheds as well as most of the public loading sidings and ramps used by smaller customers. As a result, most of the remaining <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> today are just used as container or transshipment stations.|$|R
25|$|A {{railway station}} {{serves as an}} area where {{passengers}} can board and alight from trains. A <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> is a yard which is exclusively used for loading and unloading cargo. Large passenger stations {{have at least one}} building providing conveniences for passengers, such as purchasing tickets and food. Smaller stations typically only consist of a platform. Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{terminal}} {{station in the}} world was Crown Street railway station in Liverpool, built in 1830, on the locomotive hauled Liverpool to Manchester line. As the first train on the Liverpool-Manchester line left Liverpool, the station is slightly older than the Manchester terminal at Liverpool Road. The station was the first to incorporate a train shed. The station was demolished in 1836 as the Liverpool {{terminal station}} moved to Lime Street railway station. Crown Street station was converted to a <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> terminal.|$|E
25|$|At Carlisle {{the first}} {{passenger}} station remained in use, but the original goods facilities had been {{enhanced by the}} opening of a separate Viaduct <b>goods</b> <b>station,</b> and a route for goods and mineral trains passing the passenger station giving direct independent access from the Maryport and Carlisle Railway route; iron ore from Workington to the ironworks of the Monklands and become hugely significant by this time. The goods by-pass lines at Carlisle became very extensive and were jointly owned and operated by several railway companies.|$|E
50|$|Edge Hill was {{the site}} of huge railway {{marshalling}} yards until the 1970s, sorting trains to and from the docks via the Victoria Tunnel and Wapping Tunnel to Park Lane and Waterloo <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> on the dockside.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{opened with}} the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859. It was {{described}} {{at the time}} as [...] "of ornamental design ... conveniently situated close to the town, and consists of arrival, departure, and <b>goods</b> <b>stations,</b> all three being constructed of stone".|$|R
50|$|For the {{majority}} of its use, it served the LNWR and CLC <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> which adjoined the dock. The LNWR had a warehouse, on the southern quayside, much used for storing bananas. The dock was partially filled in 1991, removing access from East Float.|$|R
25|$|The main London goods depot was at 'Willow Walk', {{part of the}} Bricklayers Arms complex, {{where the}} LB {{established}} its facilities in 1849. These were enlarged in 1854 after it entered into {{an agreement with the}} LC to handle its goods traffic. Further extensions were built in 1865 and 1902. The LB constructed a marshalling yard to the south of Norwood Junction during the 1870s, extended in the early 1880s. Other goods facilities in London were at Battersea and Deptford Wharf. There was a separate <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> at Brighton, adjacent to the passenger station.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened. This set {{the pattern}} for modern railways. It was the world's first inter-city {{passenger}} railway {{and the first to}} have 'scheduled' services, terminal stations and services as we know them today. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world's first goods terminal station at the Park Lane railway <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> at Liverpool's south docks, accessed by the 1.26 mile Wapping Tunnel. In 1836, at the Liverpool end the line was extended to Lime Street Station in Liverpool's city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Having {{obtained}} {{a foothold in}} both Plymouth and Devonport, the LSWR now set about improving its facilities in the area {{so that it could}} reduce its dependency on the broad gauge companies. On 1 February 1878 it opened its own <b>goods</b> <b>station</b> at Friary {{on the east side of}} Plymouth. This used a connection over the SDR's Sutton Harbour branch, which made an east-facing connection with the main line at Laira Junction that allowed LSWR goods trains to run directly from the Lidford line to Friary. The LSWR opened a short extension from Friary to the wharves at nearby Sutton Harbour on 22 October 1879.|$|E

25|$|Two {{impressive}} viaducts {{remain on}} the completed part of the line between Royston Junction and Dewsbury as {{a testament to the}} Midland's ambition to complete a third direct Anglo-Scottish route. The line served two <b>goods</b> <b>stations</b> and provided a route for occasional express passenger trains before its eventual closure in 1968.|$|R
50|$|As the FMSR was an {{essential}} shipping channel {{to and from}} the interior of Malaya, some stations serving sea ports and commercial and industrial centres doubled as <b>goods</b> <b>stations,</b> managing tin and rubber shipments alongside other essential goods; such stations are typically complemented with godowns and marshalling/goods yards of varying sizes.|$|R
