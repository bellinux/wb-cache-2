40|$|In metal cutting, the {{magnitude}} of the temperature at the tool-chip interface {{is a function of the}} cutting parameters. This temperature directly affects production; therefore, increased research on the role of cutting temperatures can lead to improved machining operations. In this study, tool temperature was estimated by simultaneous temperature measurement employing both a K-type thermocouple and an <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> (IR) <b>pyrometer</b> to measure the tool-chip interface temperature. Due to the complexity of the machining processes, the integration of different measuring techniques was necessary in order to obtain consistent temperature data. The thermal analysis results were compared via the ANSYS finite element method. Experiments were carried out in dry machining using workpiece material of AISI 4140 alloy steel that was heat treated by an induction process to a hardness of 50 HRC. A PVD TiAlN-TiN-coated WNVG 080404 -IC 907 carbide insert was used during the turning process. The results showed that with increasing cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut, the tool temperature increased; the cutting speed was found to be the most effective parameter in assessing the temperature rise. The heat distribution of the cutting tool, tool-chip interface and workpiece provided effective and useful data for the optimization of selected cutting parameters during orthogonal machining...|$|R

A high degree of accuracy in measuring and controlling the aforementioned temperature is therefore required. In almost the totality of WTE plants this measurement process is carried out by using practical industrial thermometers, such as bare thermocouples and <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> (IR) <b>pyrometers,</b> even if affected by different physical contributions which can make the gas temperature measurements incorrect.

We observed the effects of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> on renal proximal tubules cells, including its effects on cell proliferation, gene and protein expression, and viability. We also examined the protective effects of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> against cisplatin, a nephrotoxic agent, using the human proximal tubule cell line HK- 2. We found that daily exposure to far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> for 30 min significantly increased rabbit renal proximal tubule cell proliferation in vitro, as assessed by MTT assay. Far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> was not only beneficial to renal proximal tubule cell proliferation, it also increased the expression of ATPase Na+/K+ subunit alpha 1 and glucose transporter 1, as determined by western blotting. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> enhanced CDK 5 R 1, GNAS, NPPB, and TEK expression. In the proximal tubule cell line HK- 2, far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> protected against cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity by reducing apoptosis.

40|$|Laser forming of a {{sheet metal}} is the bending process {{caused by the}} thermal {{stresses}} which is produced in the sheet by laser irradiation. Therefore, the temperature distribution in the sheet irradiated with laser beam is one of important factors to determine the bending angle of the sheet. In this study, the influence of temperature distribution and the experimental conditions like the diameter of laser beam and the thickness of a sheet on the bending angle is investigated experimentally. The temperatures of a surface irradiated with CO 2 laser and its opposite surface are measured using an <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometer</b> with an optical fiber. As a result, the bending angle is directly proportional to the temperature Ts at the sheet surface irradiated with laser beam and the beam diameter D, and inversely proportional to the thickness h of the sheet.

A carbon steel, a titanium, a molybdenum and a tungsten are used as work materials, and a silicon nitride Si 3 N 4, a zirconia ZrO 2 and a diamond are used as tool materials. The cutting temperature increases in proportion to the 1 / 2 power of cutting speed and saturates to the melting point of work material. The fraction of heat conducted into the cutting tool is independent on the cutting speed, and it becomes larger as the thermal conductivity of workpiece is smaller or that of tool material is larger.

Aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> offers effective stimulation of the vestibular organ, whether it is well tolerated by the patients and especially whether it is a viable alternative to warm air stimulation in patients with defects of the tympanic membrane and radical mastoid cavities. Patients with perforations of the tympanic membrane (n = 15) and with radical mastoid cavities (n = 13) were tested both with near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> and warm dry air. A caloric-induced nystagmus could be seen equally effectively and rapidly in all patients.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{characteristics of}} {{a new type of}} <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometer</b> using an optical fiber are investigated theoretically and experimentally. The structure of this pyrometer is that the optical fiber accepts the infrared flux radiated from the object and transmits it to an infrared detector InSb cell. This I. R.

The flexibility of the optical fiber also makes it possible to measure the inner temperature of the object by drilling a microscopically fine hole in it and inserting the fiber. Three types of optical fiber were employed : quartz fiber, fluoride fiber and chalcogenide fiber. The main results obtained are as follows. The setting location of the fiber is independent of the total energy Accepted by the fiber, even if the object of a flat surface is not placed vertically to the axis of the fiber. This result is also applied to the object of a curved surface. The target area of the graded-index fiber is smaller than that of the step-index fiber when they are placed at a same distance from the object. The I. R.

40|$|A new three-color <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometer</b> {{using an}} optical fiber is {{developed}} for measuring cutting temperature in high speed machining by small ball end mill. The high speed air spindle unit is adopted to the ordinary milling machine {{so that the}} maximum spindle revolution of 40000 rpm is attainable. The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of spindle rotational speed, radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 °C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 ° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in air cutting reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from tool shank to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and workpiece change along the ballnose...|$|E

Therefore, the research in the field of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement mainly focuses on indirect measurement. The accuracy of indirect <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement is affected by many factors. Accurate calibration of measuring equipment is required to obtain accurate measurement values. This calibration requires an accurate calculation model, and the establishment of the model is closely related to the idea of the model, the environmental condition of the measurement area and the time of measurement [2 – 11].

During the treatment, patients and a medical observer conducted independent photographic and clinical evaluations every 4 weeks, and skin biopsies were obtained for histological analysis at baseline and one month post-treatment. We found that the content of collagen and elastin produced by the fibroblasts increased after <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation,</b> and that this increase was proportional to the duration of irradiation exposure. Following 6 months of treatment, all patients reported good (51 - 75 %) improvements in skin texture and roughness.
