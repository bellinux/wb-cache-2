50|$|While in China, he was {{impressed}} with the way the buildings fit into the landscape, and he was already familiar with the healing power of nature. He had seen in his mind a sanitarium located below a triangular mountain peak, and he and Verna began to search for a beautiful setting for their healing center. In 1952, they <b>felt</b> <b>guided</b> to purchase Friendly Hills Ranch in Hemet, California, beneath the spectacular - and triangular - Tahquitz Peak.

60|$|So {{they turned}} {{once more in}} single file down by the great glacier, and retraced their way to Pontresina without exchanging another word.

June Shimonshi, writing for Library Journal describes the manga as [...] "formulaic" [...] and as being solely driven by sex, finding the word balloons and panels difficult to follow. Shimonshi recommends Love Mode and the Finder series for those looking for explicit yaoi instead of this manga.|$|R

40|$|The Healthy Child Programme {{recommends}} {{using the}} Promotional Guide to explore health needs. This paper presents {{the findings of}} a qualitative research study using normalisation process theory to identify factors that affect the implementation of the Guide. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with health visitors (n= 9) to explore their experiences of implementation. Health visitors were positive and <b>felt</b> the <b>Guide</b> enhanced their practice, but embedding it into practice was not straightforward. The multiple purposes of the antenatal appointment produced points of disjuncture. Integration was achieved only when the Guide was considered to fulfil the perceived requirements of the organisation and the client perceived the intervention as worthwhile. Factors affecting implementation included: lack of client awareness of the health visiting service; integration of client needs with organisational agenda; organisational compliance, electronic patient record and monitoring systems provided no incentive for Promotional Guide use; continuity of practitioner; health visitor communication skills; and endorsement by senior management. To minimise difficulties, it is recommended that an implementation strategy is used when introducing the Promotional Guide into health visiting practice...|$|R

40|$|Home {{environment}} {{is key to}} the development of obesity-preventing behaviors during childhood, yet few resources help preschool parents address factors at home associated with obesity risk. This paper describes creation of materials for an in-home intervention (HomeStyles) with this population. An advisory group of stakeholders and target audience members determined salient factors affecting childhood obesity to address in-home and developed program materials. The Social Cognitive Theory, Faith’s Core Behavior Change Strategies to Treat Childhood Obesity, Adult Learning Theory and motivational interviewing techniques guided development of 12 guides targeting strategies parents can use to shape the home environment. Interviews were conducted to determine effectiveness of the guides. Cognitive testing of guide design (n = 251) and content (n = 261) occurred in English and Spanish in New Jersey and Arizona with parents and home visitation staff who would present the guides. Interviews investigated perceptions of content usefulness and parent comprehension. Findings were also examined in light of theoretical underpinnings. Both home visitation staff and parents <b>felt</b> the <b>guides</b> were very readable and useful. Parents appreciated use of motivational interviewing techniques and Adult Learning Theory. Current research is testing these guides through an in-home, randomized control trial...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{reviewed}} {{the history of}} the Department of Early Childhood Care and Education up to the initiation of the course on "Early Childhood Christian Education" as well as the role that the course has played. We also conducted a survey among students on the phrases from the Bible they would like to pass on to children in the future. The survey results revealed that the students chose phrases that they feel they were moved or encouraged by as well as the phrases that they <b>felt</b> provided <b>guiding</b> principles for life. This indicates that, rather than an understanding of the existence of God or the Christian doctrine, the students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of Christianity comes through a simple sense of the appreciation and prayers that they experience in their daily lives. The most noteworthy result from the survey is that fact that the students are encouraged and saved by these phrases from the Bible and they try to face their difficulties and strive to live as best as they possibly can. Students form their character and grow through the experience of overcoming difficulties in life, and the contemplation of these experiences helps them develop skills with which to aid children form their own characters...|$|R
