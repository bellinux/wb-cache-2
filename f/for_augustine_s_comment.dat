50|$|Clayton {{has been}} the county seat since 1834, {{two years after the}} {{creation}} of Barbour County. Clayton is located geographically {{in the center of the}} county. The town was located at the headwaters of the Pea and Choctawhatchee rivers on the historic road from Hobdy's Bridge over the Pea River to Eufaula on the Chattahoochee River. By 1818, there were a few settlers in the area around Clayton, but settlement began in earnest around 1823. The town was named <b>for</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>S.</b> Clayton, a Georgia jurist and congressman. Clayton became the county seat of Barbour County in 1833 and was laid out on a central courthouse square plan. The first Circuit Court was held in Clayton on September 23, 1833. The Clayton post office was established in September 1835 with John F. Keener as postmaster. Clayton, with a population of 200, was incorporated on December 21, 1841, by the Alabama Legislature. Its first mayor, after incorporation, was John Jackson.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a general overview of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> insights into passions {{as well as}} his approach to the therapy of emotions and their sanctification. Attending to various phases of his writings, this work explores the systematic structure of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> tenets on passions and on the freedom from passions in the context of his philosophical and theological convictions on the issue of amor sui and amor Dei. The analysis begins by examining <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> language of passions and the doctrinal connections between Augustine and his predecessors. I provide a survey of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> usage of emotional terms and criticise the position that Augustine suggested a dichotomy between passio and affectus as well as the claim that none of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> Latin terms can be justifiably translated by the modern term emotion. On the basis of terminological and doctrinal observations, I clarify the general features of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> psychology of passions in Chapter 2. In addressing the issue of how Augustine transformed his predecessors therapy of passions and their ideal of freedom from emotion into his theological framework in Chapter 3, I examine a series of related concepts, such as propatheia, metriopatheia, apatheia and eupatheia, to determine how he understood them in various stages of his philosophical and theological thinking. On this basis, I draw an outline of <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> interpretation of emotions in his theological anthropology. During his early period, Augustine adopted the Stoic and Platonic therapy of passions and the Stoic ideal of freedom from emotion (apatheia), but he changed his position later, re-evaluating the received terminologies and values of emotions (love, will, justice, virtue, etc.) {{from the perspective of the}} doctrines of sin and grace. He developed a theological vision and evaluation of the human condition of emotions and he expressed a pessimistic attitude towards the human condition without the help of supernatural grace. Chapter 4 addresses <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> position on the criticism and renewal of passions in social life: the household, city, and the world. In Chapter 5, I argue that <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> ideal of freedom from passions was participation in the inner Trinitarian spiritual life by the bond of the Holy Spirit as a hallmark of deification. This is wholly dependent on the divine kenosis and the transaction in the person of Christ. By virtue of the gift of grace (the salvific real presence of the Holy Spirit in faith), the pilgrimaging citizens of the City of God will be elevated to the divine realm and become transformed into a better substance in the union with God in Heaven. Contrary to arguments by some Orthodox theologians, <b>Augustine</b> <b>s</b> theory of deification is not simply a matter of fulfilment of humanity without a genuine transformation. While grace improves the control of sinful impulses in the emotional life of believers who suffer the consequences of the damage of the soul through original sin, Augustine maintained that the new life in Heaven denotes freedom from this emotional condition as well as the non-apathetic peaceful love and joy of resurrected persons in their participation in the divine spiritual nature...|$|R

40|$|On 12 May 1857, Edward Sieveking read a {{paper on}} {{epilepsy}} to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in London. During the discussion that followed Sir Charles Locock, obstetrician to Queen Victoria, {{was reported to have}} commented that during the past 14 months he had used potassium bromide to successfully stop epileptic seizures in all but one of 14 or 15 women with 2 ̆ 7 hysterical 2 ̆ 7 or catamenial epilepsy.

The poverty line methodology he criticises is the one widely employed by economists in all developed countries; his attack on the reliability of the income distribution is based on inappropriate evidence; his assessment of the effects of including non-cash benefits is severely flawed, and he confuses measurement of the overall redistributive impact of state policy and measurement of poverty...|$|R

5000|$|<b>For</b> <b>Augustine,</b> {{the evil}} of sexual immorality {{was not in the}} sexual act itself, but rather in the {{emotions}} that typically accompany it. In On Christian Doctrine Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God. Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (On marriage and concupiscence 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (On marriage and concupiscence 1.27; A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians 2.27). <b>For</b> <b>Augustine,</b> proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the [...] "better" [...] way (Confessions 8.2) and abstain from marriage (On marriage and concupiscence 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, <b>for</b> <b>Augustine</b> a sin, although necessarily producing {{the evil of}} sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.|$|R
