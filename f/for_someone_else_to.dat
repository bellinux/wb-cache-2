25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

50|$|In 1820 about 20% of the United States {{population}} {{depended on}} a wage income. That percentage increased to 90% by 1950. Generally, by 1950, farmers and craftsmen {{were the only}} people not dependent on working <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Prior <b>to</b> that time, most people were able to survive by hunting and farming their own food, making their own supplies, and remaining almost fully self-sufficient. As transportation became more efficient and technologies developed, self-sufficiency became an economically poor choice. As in the Lowell Textile Mills, various machines and processes were developed for each step of the production process, thus making mass production a cheaper and faster alternative to individual production. In addition, as the population grew and transportation improved, the pre-organizational system struggled to support the needs of the market. These conditions made for a wage-dependent population that sought out jobs in growing organizations, leading to a shift away from individual and family production.|$|R

Liz accepts, seeing this as an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> get the lack of respect and complaints she does. She gets upset, though, when Toofer gets a television interview as head writer, and insists that she herself should also be there as she is co-head writer. The two appear on Rutherford Rice's (Reg E.

Liz gets visibly upset when Rice gives Toofer all of the credit she deserves, {{and as a result of}} her behavior she is escorted off the set by a security guard.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1847, Pierce was {{promoted}} to brigadier general, and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, {{in time for the}} Battle of Contreras. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury. The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> take command, [...] "General Pierce is a damned coward."

40|$|The human {{capacity}} to communicate has been hypothesized to be causally dependent upon language. Intuitively this seems plausible since most communication relies on language. Moreover, intention recognition abilities (as a necessary prerequisite for communication) and language development seem to co-develop. Here we review evidence from neuroimaging {{as well as}} from neuropsychology to evaluate the relationship between communicative and linguistic abilities. Our review indicates that communicative abilities are best considered as neurally distinct from language abilities. This conclusion is based upon evidence showing that humans rely on different cortical systems when designing a communicative message <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> as compared <b>to</b> when performing core linguistic tasks, as well as upon observations of individuals with severe language loss after extensive lesions to the language system, who are still able to perform tasks involving intention understandin...|$|R

2500|$|The {{voice of}} Peter is {{provided}} by MacFarlane, who also provides the voice for Brian, Stewie and Quagmire. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, most prominently those of news anchor Tom Tucker, Carter Pewterschmidt (Lois' father), and Dr. Hartman. MacFarlane {{has been part of}} the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, as well he has been voicing Peter from the start. MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and the rest of characters' voices himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> attempt it. MacFarlane's speaking voice is not very close to Peter's; he uses his normal voice as the voice of Brian. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from the security guards he overheard talking while he was attending the Rhode Island School of Design; according to him, [...] "I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up in New England. Guys who would not think before they spoke, like [...] there was no self-editing mechanism. [...] Everything in here, [...] it's coming out here". MacFarlane also voices many of Peter's ancestors who share the same type of voice. He noted in an interview that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom to do it himself. In another interview, he mentioned that Peter's voice is one of the most difficult to do.|$|E

40|$|She Works - She Writes’ is a {{work that}} {{simultaneously}} incorporates the narrative documentation of a live action as an integral element of its performance. It analyses the processes and methods of the body as archival record and interpretative account and explores the dialogue between the body politic, as the objectifiable property of performance, and its socialisation as documentary artifact. Effectively, it examines {{the ways in which}} the live can be denied being made static through documentation. In expanding and exploring the role of the documenter and their methods of communication in this way, a sense of narrative, of interpretation, is engaged. The document tells a story - it describes an actuality. Yet is it possible to take the document as a true account of the event being transcribed? This dilemma is explored in this work as the documenter will act as the communicator of a ‘hidden’ performance, a performance that only they can see. Beyond hearing the sounds of the ‘hidden’ performer, the audiences understanding of the work will be wholly reliant on the process of textual documentation. The documenter is effectively the sole observer of the methods and processes informing their narration, and they are relied upon to communicate the truth. Like looking through a lens that has been set up <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> and responds <b>to</b> their viewpoint only, they are positioned to respond to the process of documentation and to analyse their relationship to it. The performer’s body will be denied politicization here, as its objectification will be denied. Instead the documenter, the usually veiled interpreter of the live experience, will trade places with the performer. In this way they will become the body of objectification by communicating the archival legacy of the live event. ‘She Works - She Writes’ is a development from ‘Live / Archive’ which was made and performed as part of a residency in Spring 2012 at Grace Exhibition Space, New York. The performance and accompanying talk titled 'Research and Collaboration', which discusses and details the varying approaches in our work, were scheduled by invitation from Miami International Festival...|$|R
