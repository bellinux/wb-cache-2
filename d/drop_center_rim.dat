40|$|We discuss an evaporation-induced wetting {{transition}} on superhydrophobic stripes, {{and show}} that depending on the elastic energy of the deformed contact line, which determines {{the value of an}} instantaneous effective contact angle, two different scenarios occur. For relatively dilute stripes the receding angle is above 90 ^∘, and the sudden impalement transition happens due to an increase of a curvature of an evaporating drop. For dense stripes the slow impregnation transition commences when the effective angle reaches 90 ^∘ and represents the impregnation of the grooves from the triple contact line towards the <b>drop</b> <b>center.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for calculating the surface density profile of a stain deposited by a drop with a receding contact line. Unlike a pinned drop, a receding drop pushes fluid towards its interior, continuously deposits mass across its substrate as it evaporates, and does not produce the usual "coffee ring. " For a thin, circular drop with a constant evaporation rate, we find the surface density of the stain goes as η(r) ∝((r/a_ 0) ^- 1 / 2 -r/a_ 0), where r is the radius from the <b>drop</b> <b>center</b> and a_ 0 is the initial outer radius. Under these conditions, the deposited stain has a mountain-like morphology. Our framework can easily be extended to investigate new stain morphologies left by drying drops.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the wetting {{properties of the}} simplest element of an array of random fibers: two rigid fibers crossing with an inclination angle and in contact with a droplet of a perfectly wetting liquid.

An analytical model is provided that predicts the wetting length as well as the presence of a non-symmetric state in the mixed morphology regime. The model also highlights a symmetry breaking at the transition between the column state and the mixed morphology. The possibility to tune the morphology of the liquid could have important implications for drying processes...|$|R
