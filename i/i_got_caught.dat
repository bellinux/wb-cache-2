But <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> out.” The Spaniard continued, and was very nearly caught on the final lap by the recovering world champion.|$|R

The first draft was, originally, longer than the version that was finally published. Some sections were shortened while others had to be surgically removed from the book.

The Apple II version received a Certificate of Merit in the [...] "Computer Game of the Year" [...] category at the 4th annual Arkie Awards. Ahoy! criticized the Commodore 64 version's slow load times and annoying wall-collision detection, but called Castle Wolfenstein [...] "addicting.

Not that I ain't enjoying your company--I sure do enjoy it--but I just can't afford to be caught. I know what they'd do to me in this here city. There was a young fellow that got fifty years only last week for holding a man up on the street for two dollars and eighty-five cents. I {{read about it in}} the paper. When times is hard and they ain't no work, men get desperate. And then the other men who've got {{something}} to be robbed of get desperate, too, and they just sure soak it to the other fellows.

Way up North in a frozen sea a poor fellow went overboard. I didn't get him and he drowned; but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> between two cakes of {{floating}} ice that jammed my nose out of its former perfect contour. In Yucatan I tumbled into a hedge of poisoned cactus and had to operate on myself--quickly, too--to save my life. Wild with pain, I slashed my face to get the poisoned tips of thorn out of the flesh. Parts of my body are like my face, but fortunately I can cover them. It was bad surgery. On another I could have operated without leaving a scar, but I was frantic with pain. Don't stare at that big eye, sir; it's glass. I lost that optic in Pernambuco and couldn't find a glass substitute to fit my face. Indeed, {{this was the only}} one in town, made for a fat Spanish lady who turned it down because it was not exactly the right color." ...|$|E

The dance sequences in the video were choreographed by Nadine [...] "Hi-Hat" [...] Ruffin, and are said to incorporate ballet, popping and locking, tribal dance and moves {{similar to the ones}} in the eighties drama Flashdance. Talking about her dancing in the video, Shakira said, [...] "I start doing all kinds of outrageous stuff and hanging upside down and doing stuff that wasn't planned.

60|$|I {{watched him}} make a most atrocious cast. But the water boiled, and he hooked two good-sized trout at once. Quite {{speechless}} with envy and admiration I watched him play them and eventually beach them. They were cutthroat trout, silvery-sided and {{marked with the}} red slash along their gills that gave them their name. I did not catch any while wading, but from the bank I spied one, and dropping a fly {{in front of his}} nose, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him.

6000|$|... "FOR {{two days}} I {{sheltered}} in a pleasant grove where {{there had been}} no deaths. In those two days, while badly depressed and believing that my turn would come at any moment, nevertheless I rested and recuperated. So did the pony. And on the third day, putting what small store of tinned provisions I possessed on the pony's back, I started on across a very lonely land. Not a live man, woman, or child, did I encounter, though the dead were everywhere. Food, however, was abundant. The land then was not as it is now. It was all cleared of trees and brush, and it was cultivated. The food for millions of mouths was growing, ripening, and going to waste. From the fields and orchards I gathered vegetables, fruits, and berries. Around the deserted farmhouses <b>I</b> <b>got</b> eggs and <b>caught</b> chickens. And frequently I found supplies of tinned provisions in the store-rooms.|$|R

On one occasion, he even found himself approached by a young indigenous player from another club immediately after a match who asked him to pose for a photograph with him before leaving the ground. His progression from erratic youth to responsible adult had been guided by mentor and former teammate, fellow aborigine Michael McLean.
