40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the frameworks {{of writing and}} devising employed by two influential British theatre companies of the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries: Frantic Assembly and Forced Entertainment. I place these companies – not usually considered together – in dialogue, drawing on archive material from the decades-long span of their careers. Clues {{to the development of}} their creative methods are sought from rehearsal tapes and scripts, as well as other material surrounding each company’s output; this includes <b>education</b> <b>packs,</b> reviews, interviews (some newly conducted by myself), promotional videos and other manifestations of the rhetoric around the creation of the works in question. I focus closely on several specific productions for each company, but frame these detailed studies within a wider exploration of the developing styles, shifting methods and changing material circumstances within which these productions were created. My first chapter assesses existing proposed definitions of devising, adopting and nuancing certain key terms in the light of my observations of the companies examined. Within these frameworks, I use the particular case studies to illuminate concerns central to the creation of new theatrical work more widely, involving overlapping processes of devising and writing. In particular, I probe anxieties, paradoxes and revelations around the roles of writing and collaboration. By tracing the companies’ rhetorics and practices over a considerable length of time, I throw new light on the slow accretion and nuancing of process within both companies...|$|R

40|$|Deakin University has {{for all of}} its {{existence}} supplied its distance <b>education</b> students with <b>packs</b> of printed course material. Despite the growth of online education the demand for printed material continues to grow. Faced with the challenge of improving processes Deakin University has turned to a process mapping model and ithink software to help it dynamically model internal processes allowing for the monitoring of demand shifts to see when and where tension is occurring in the system. The software allows the user to modify resource allocations to graphically observe where and when the ‘bottle-necks’ and capacity gaps are occurring and to perform a series of ‘what-if’ scenarios to address these capacity issues. These results are then allowing the University to work out where the ‘sticking points’ are and to improve resource allocation and processes. While the printing part of the course materials development process has been the pilot, the University expects to model all course material development processes, including hard copy, multimedia and online, using the ithink software. <br /...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} with follow up {{investigations}} sought to: 1) determine whether cold packs (over-the-counter symptomtic treatments), coupled with in-office education, improve antibiotic-related knowledge, {{attitudes and behaviors}} more than in-office education alone in patient populations with high percentages of Asian Americans and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders; 2) identify possible reasons for intervention outcomes as described by physicians {{who participated in the}} field study; and 3) explore potential future directions based on a large sample survey of physicians in the field study's highly ethnic county. The intervention resulted in a pre- to post-consultation decrease in perceived need for and an increase in knowledge about antibiotic risks but had no impact on frequency of reported receipt of an antibiotic prescription. Unexpectedly, in-office education alone was more effective in increasing knowledge than in-office education plus the cold pack. In-depth interviews of field study physicians and a large scale physician survey suggest that cold pack interventions targeting patient populations with high percentages of Asian Americans and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders {{may be more likely to}} succeed if accompanied by mass public education regarding risks and physician training regarding effective ways to talk to patients.
