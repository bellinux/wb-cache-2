5|$|At {{the start}} of her American-Hawaiian career, American sailed in {{scheduled}} service from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan, up to San Francisco {{and from there to}} Honolulu. Along the way, she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high <b>fire</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high <b>fire</b> <b>danger.</b> The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|E

The results of this research can be used as the basis for developing an early warning system for land and forest fires in Indonesia.

The results of the mapping areas that vulnerable to forest and land fire based on the physical parameters have indicates uniform patterns with the distribution and density of hotspots in the Sumatra and Kalimantan over the last 10 years (2006 - 2015).

Every day during the fire season the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecasts an outlook of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Index (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation.

40|$|Forest <b>fire</b> {{risk and}} <b>danger</b> mapping is about forest fire {{potential}} estimating. Spatial differentiation of forest <b>fire</b> risk and <b>danger</b> is {{obvious in the}} Northeastern China Forest Zone, and it is of crucial importance in setting up management objectives in this region. Based on RS and GIS technology and spatial logistic regression analysis, {{the relations between the}} burn scar and its influencing factors were evaluated using Wald step forward logistic regression. Using logistic regression model, forest fire risk probability of each pixel was calculated and five-class forest <b>fire</b> risk and <b>danger</b> zones were identified. The result shows that spatial differentiation of forest <b>fire</b> risk and <b>danger</b> is obvious in the region. Different forest fire management can be applied in different fire risk zone. To eradicate forest fire from the beginning, budgets, personnel, technology, equipment, early warning and monitoring systems need to be adjusted in fire management systems.

25|$|Of {{primary concern}} {{with respect to}} the Hayward Fault is the huge Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond. Although founded on better ground than most of the shoreline, this {{refinery}} has extensive crude oil and finished product docks and pipelines extending into the bay, which could produce catastrophic spills into the bay, with the potential to adversely affect hundreds of miles of sensitive wetlands. Dismantling of high pressure and temperature process units and the consequent <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> to personnel and equipment could produce substantial economic consequences for the western states.

The storm then moved out into the southern Plains States, bringing heavy snow to Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas. Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms, with hail, wind, and tornadoes, affected parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. The storm then moved across the Mid-Atlantic States, and into the Atlantic Ocean, following the East Coast.
