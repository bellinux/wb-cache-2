40|$|Every year, {{millions}} of people are seeking protection from countries other than their own for fear of being tortured, persecuted or killed. Finding protection is not easy. States are closely guarding their borders, making it difficult for aliens to seek and enjoy protection from serious harm. No matter where they are or why they flee, people seeking international protection are vulnerable and insecure; in dire need of knowing, understanding and receiving their rights. This book explores the basic right of every <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> to be protected from refoulement. The prohibition of refoulement is the cornerstone of international refugee and asylum law and aims to provide protection to people at risk of persecution, torture, inhuman treatment or other human rights violations upon return to their own country. This book provides a comprehensive legal analysis of prohibitions of refoulement contained in four human rights treaties: the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. The emphasis of the analysis is on the international meaning of the prohibitions of refoulement and on the responsibilities of States deriving from these prohibitions. The four treaties are analysed in separate chapters. The final chapter compares the prohibitions of refoulement contained in the four investigated treaties. This book will be an important resource for legal scholars, students and practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. It is also a reminder for States, which have obliged themselves to protect people from becoming victims of unspeakable atrocities. Promotor: P. Boeles, B. P. VermeulenWith summary in Dutc...|$|E
40|$|The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda has {{successfully}} constructed {{the figure of}} the conflict-affected woman as a subject worthy of attention, inclusion and protection {{on the part of the}} international community. This concern is especially palpable when she is physically present in a conflict zone. As the conflict-affected woman flees and seeks safety and security in Europe, however, she moves to the periphery of the area of concern of WPS policies and discourses. In this working paper, we demonstrate that <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> skirt the margins of the WPS agenda: refugees are present in WPS policies, but as the subjects of marginal and inconsistent concern. We interrogate the effects of this marginalisation, and suggest that including refugee questions in WPS policymaking and scholarship carries the potential to improve security provision for those who have fled to Europe, as well as to revive the transformative potential of the WPS agend...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Time and {{resource}} efficient mental disorder screening mechanisms {{are not available}} to identify {{the growing number of}} refugees and other <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> in priority need for mental health care. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify efficient screening instruments and mechanisms for the detection of moderate and severe mental disorders in a refugee setting. Methods Lay interviewers applied a screening algorithm to detect individuals with severe distress or mental disorders in randomly selected households in a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon. The method included household informant and individual level interviews using a Vignettes of Local Terms and Concepts for mental disorders (VOLTAC), individual and household informant portions of the field-test version of the WHO-UNHCR Assessment Schedule of Serious Symptoms in Humanitarian Settings (WASSS) and the WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ- 20). A subset of participants were then reappraised utilizing the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II, and the Global Assessment of Functioning. The study constitutes a secondary analysis of interview data from 283 randomly selected households (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 009748 adult residents) who participated in a mental health disorders prevalence study in 2010. Results The 5 -item household informant portion of WASSS was the most efficient instrument among those tested. It detected adults with severe mental disorders with 95...|$|R
40|$|The Refugee Act, {{passed in}} 1998, has been welcomed as a {{necessary}} {{piece of legislation that}} provides for the needs of <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> coming to South Africa in search of asylum. It states that refugees are allowed to seek employment and to access education, as well as being entitled to the rights enshrined in Chapter 2 of the Constitution (with the exception of political rights and the rights to freedom of trade, occupation, and profession, which do not apply to non-citizens). Nothing is explicitly said, however, about the right to access other basic services such as housing, water, sanitation and safety. Many of these rights are met through services delivered at a local government level. The role of local government in the provision of services to refugees has not been clearly spelled out, either in the Refugee Act or in other policy documents. In addition, little is said about the potential barriers that exist to refugees accessing local services, in spite of the enabling legislation being in place. In spite of this lack of clarity {{about the role of the}} different tiers of government in the provision of rights that refugees are entitled to, local governments are increasingly coming into contact with migrant groups of different kinds. They therefore need to begin to identify their role in relation to providing services and safety to refugee communities. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of {{international}} mobility, refugees make up a very specific population. In contrast to most migrants, <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> have little opportunity for expanding livelihoods, and are usually faced with realities that deny them a dignified life and fulfilment of their capabilities. In many situations, people who left their homes to escape from persecution, armed conflict or violence face restrictive policies {{of the countries in}} which they found refuge and become critically dependent on humanitarian assistance. This paper describes living conditions and wellbeing of refugees – and more particularly camp-based refugees – in six countries with protracted refugee conditions: Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya in Africa, and Nepal, Bangladesh and Thailand in Asia. It primarily draws on UNHCR’s ‘Standards and Indicators’ data. Thematic areas covered in the paper include legal protection, gender-related issues, food security and nutritional status, health, education, and refugee livelihoods and coping strategies. The assessment of refugees’ living conditions proceeds along two different perspectives. The first is a gap analysis based on UNHCR standards, which are largely in line with SPHERE standards. The second is a comparison of refugees’ living conditions with those of host populations in the country of asylum and with those of populations on the country of origin. The available data lead {{to the conclusion that the}} living conditions of refugees vary across thematic areas and are strongly contextualised, depending on a complex of social, economic, political and attitudinal factors. There is also evidence that despite often grim conditions, at times the targeted efforts of humanitarian assistance and own coping strategies produce situations for refugees that are relatively better than that of the local hosting communities or the population in the region of origin. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} in the midst of a global {{migration}} crisis. By the close of 2015, the number of <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> around the globe had reached 65. 3 million, surpassing levels seen in the aftermath of the Second World War. Of these, 21. 3 million were refugees—persons whose displacement forces them to flee their home countries due to a well-founded fear of persecution. Much of the attention surrounding the migration crisis in the past two years has centered on Europe, to which more than one million migrants and refugees made their way in 2015. Most came from Syria, fleeing the violence that has beset the country since 2011. Historically, however, it is the United States that has resettled more refugees than any other country in the world. 4, 5 Since 1975, more than three million refugees have begun new lives in the United States. For police agencies across the country, this means that every year refugees are joining the communities they serve. Refugees often face unique challenges when building new lives in the United States, and police departments play a critical role in ensuring their successful integration into the community. In 2016, and as part of a general support grant from Carnegie Corporation, the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) examined promising practices and lessons learned for police outreach to refugees in the community. As part of this study, PERF documented the impact that refugee outreach has on police work, public safety, and building trust with the community. PERF conducted site visits with police departments and their community partners, as well as in-depth telephone interviews with police practitioners across the country. With support from Carnegie Corporation, PERF also held a one-day forum in Washington, D. C. on September 13, 2016 for police agencies and their community partners to discuss refugee engagement and methods for success. This report details PERF's findings. Intended to serve as a guide for police professionals, this report presents promising practices and lessons learned for conducting outreach to your refugee community. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Access to HIV {{and malaria}} control {{programmes}} for refugees and internally <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> (IDPs) {{is not only}} a human rights issue but a public health priority for affected populations and host populations. The primary source of funding for malaria and HIV programmes for many countries is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). This article analyses the current HIV and malaria National Strategic Plans (NSPs) and Global Fund approved proposals from rounds 1 - 8 for countries in Africa hosting populations with refugees and/or IDPs to document their inclusion. Methods The review was limited to countries in Africa as they constitute the highest caseload of refugees and IDPs affected by HIV and malaria. Only countries with a refugee and/or IDP population of ≥ 10, 000 persons were included. NSPs were retrieved from primary and secondary sources while approved Global Fund proposals were obtained from the organisation's website. Refugee figures were obtained from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' database and IDP figures from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. The inclusion of refugees and IDPs was classified into three categories: 1) no reference; 2) referenced; and 3) referenced with specific activities. Findings A majority of countries did not mention IDPs (57 %) compared with 48 % for refugees in their HIV NSPs. For malaria, refugees were not included in 47 % of NSPs compared with 44 % for IDPs. A minority (21 - 29 %) of HIV and malaria NSPs referenced and included activities for refugees and IDPs. There were more approved Global Fund proposals for HIV than malaria for countries with both refugees and IDPs, respectively. The majority of countries with ≥ 10, 000 refugees and IDPs did not include these groups in their approved proposals (61 %- 83 %) with malaria having a higher rate of exclusion than HIV. Interpretation Countries that have signed the 1951 refugee convention have an obligation to care for refugees and this includes provision of health care. IDPs are citizens of their own country but like refugees may also not be a priority for Governments' NSPs and funding proposals. Besides legal obligations, Governments have a public health imperative to include these groups in NSPs and funding proposals. Governments may wish to add a component for refugees that is additional to the needs for their own citizens. The inclusion of <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> in funding proposals may have positive direct effects for host populations as international and United Nations agencies often have strong logistical capabilities that could benefit both populations. For NSPs, strong and concerted advocacy at global, regional and country levels needs to occur to successfully ensure that affected populations are included in their plans. It is essential for their inclusion to occur if we are to reach the stated goal of universal access and the Millennium Development Goals. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> {{worldwide}} is currently {{at its highest}} level since the Second World War. More than 65 million people around the globe were <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> in 2015, of which approximately a third (21 million) were displaced internationally (i.e. refugees). The vast majority of refugees reside in neighbouring developing countries (United High Commissioner for Refugees 2016 a). The consequences of displacement for those affected are significant and frequently long-lasting and affect multiple aspects of human life. One important aspect that displacement experiences can affect is access to education. Several studies suggest that forced displacement {{is one of the}} key channels through which conflict can have a detrimental impact on schooling outcomes (Chamarbagwala and Moran 2011; Justino et al. 2014; Verwimp and Van Bavel 2014).

40|$|Internally <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> {{have emerged}} {{in recent years as}} one of the most {{pressing}} humanitarian, human rights, political and security issues facing the global community. There are an estimated 20 to 25 million <b>persons</b> <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> within their own countries by conflict and human rights violations, many in acute need of protection and assistance. More than 10 million can be found in Africa, 4 to 5 million in Asia, 3 to 4 million in Europe and more than 2 million in the Americas. More than 40 countries are affected. Had these persons crossed a border, they would have a well-established international protection system to turn to under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). But for <b>persons</b> <b>forcibly</b> <b>displaced</b> within their own countries, no such predictable international system has been put in place. Although the internally displaced are uprooted for the same reasons as refugees, they remain under the jurisdiction of their governments and therefore are excluded from the international protection afforded to refugees.
