5|$|Starting from December 2007, the {{organization}} demanded that CBS cancel {{its plan to}} rebroadcast an edited version of the Showtime drama Dexter, whose title character was a serial killer and police forensics analyst, because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that the program would glorify murder even with the edits. By early February 2008, the Council claimed to have collected 17,000 complaints to CBS.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> like I {{was lying on}} my stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table.

5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and did not think <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> outdated. Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J.

5|$|Game {{director}} Shigeki Morimoto {{aimed to}} respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like a new game to those that {{were introduced to the}} series in more recent years. The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the eight best-selling DS game of all time.|$|E

5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|The Heritage Classic {{was played}} {{two months after}} the 2011 Winter Classic. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated the Winter Classic is {{designed}} for American television and to promote the game in the United States, but that the league sought to hold another game for its Canadian partners. He said the league delayed on hosting a second outdoor game until <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> it was capable of holding three significant events in a two-month span, including the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E

50|$|The Brocken Railway began {{service in}} 1899, against the already strong {{concerns}} of conservationists. For example, the botanist, Bley, wanted to prevent trains from climbing the Brocken, because <b>it</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would threaten the Brocken's flora.|$|R

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

First <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled {{marketing}} for Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was {{established}} by the government. In 1950, they presented a new report, which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered, to ease construction and increase safety. This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line. Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, {{was established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner.

5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
50|$|Angora rabbits produce coats in {{a variety}} of colours, from white through tan, gray, and brown to black. Good quality Angora fibre is around 12-16 micrometres in diameter, and can cost as much as $10-16 per ounce (35 to 50 cents/gram). <b>It</b> <b>felts</b> very easily, even on the animal itself if it is not groomed frequently.|$|R

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are {{enhanced}} remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The {{games are}} part of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS.

Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like a new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years.

5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
