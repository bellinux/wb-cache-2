5|$|Gelsomina's {{difficulties}} with her forced partnership {{are the subject}} of frequent soul searching. Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E

He also haggles for a priceless turnip (£400,000). Baldrick's turnip is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.|$|E
25|$|Popular Islam {{is based}} mostly on oral tradition. Imams with {{virtually}} no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination {{plays an important role}} in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that everything that happens <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur'an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, and jinns (spirits).|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} among beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, volunteering behavior, and purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>were</b> examined <b>in</b> this study. A total of 5, 946 participants completed {{a series of}} scales, including the Revised Personal Functions of Volunteerism Scale, Volunteering Intention Scale, and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Scale. The results showed that participants whose purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> had different levels also had varied prosocial beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, and volunteering behavior. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> associated more strongly with prosocial value function than {{with other types of}} beliefs (except understanding function). When different beliefs are grouped, the correlation between purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and other-serving beliefs was higher than that between purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and self-serving beliefs. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> also associated with volunteering intention and behavior. Path analyses showed that purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> predicted volunteering behavior via beliefs and intention. While other-serving beliefs predicted volunteering behavior directly, self-serving beliefs did not have such direct effect. © 2009 with author.

Participants who had reported {{a strong sense of}} meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>were</b> rated as desirable friends. In Study 2, participants made 10 -s videotaped introductions of themselves that were subsequently evaluated by independent raters. Those who reported a strong sense of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>were</b> rated as more likeable, better potential friends, and more desirable conversation partners. The effect of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> beyond that of several other variables, including self-esteem, happiness, extraversion, and agreeableness. Study 2 also found an interaction between physical attractiveness and meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> with more meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> contributing to greater interpersonal appeal for those of low and average physical attractiveness...|$|R

That summer, he toured in a production of Forty Carats with Eleanor Parker.|$|E
25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E
