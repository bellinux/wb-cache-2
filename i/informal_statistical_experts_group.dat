Work in <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inference is least understood in the early years, where children have had little if any exposure to data handling. A qualitative study in Australia was carried out through a series of teaching experiments with a class of five- to six-year-old children in two phases over sixmonths. The aim of the exploratory study was to understand and support the emergence of <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inference {{in the early years of}} schooling. Through activities that initially built on children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences with prediction and key characteristics of <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inference, the children 2 ̆ 7 s actions were observed in a data-based inquiry involving prediction to identify critical relationships that then supported children in making <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inferences.

40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>statistical</b> {{inference}} (ISI) {{has been}} a frequent focus of recent research in statistics education. Considering the role that context plays in developing ISI {{calls into question the}} need to be more explicit about the reasoning that underpins ISI. This paper uses educational literature on <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inference and philosophical literature on inference to argue that in order for students to generate <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inferences, {{there are a number of}} interrelated key elements that are needed to support their informal inferential reasoning. In particular, we claim that ISI is nurtured by statistical knowledge, knowledge about the problem context, and useful norms and habits developed over time, and is supported by an inquiry-based environment (tasks, tools, scaffolds). We adopt Peirce 2 ̆ 7 s and Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s view that inquiry is a sense-making process driven by doubt and belief, leading to inferences and explanations. To illustrate the roles that these elements play in supporting students to generate <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inferences, we provide an analysis of three sixth-graders 2 ̆ 7 (aged 12) informal inferential reasoning-the reasoning processes leading to their <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inferences. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>statistical</b> {{inference}} {{has gained}} increasing recognition {{as an effective}} approach to teaching statistics. Distinct from descriptive statistics, inference provides learners {{with access to the}} power of statistics by giving them tools to make predictions beyond their data. International research in this area has focused on students from primary school through university. A series of teaching experiments introduced <b>informal</b> <b>statistical</b> inference to very young children (aged 5 - 6). Although making predictions was familiar as an everyday task, initial attempts revealed challenges to teaching informal inferential reasoning to young learners. Prior to conducting a statistical inquiry involving inference, activities were designed to generate a need for recording and organising data, the language of uncertainty and using data as evidence. Results suggest that the activities prior to inquiry likely supported students in their emerging inferential practices...|$|R

40|$|In every {{political}} system {{there is an}} inbuilt tension between how a government {{is supposed to be}} organized and operate and how it really functions. The official version of how a government is organized is always complemented and sometimes even contradicted by an informal version. How the informal structure or the shadow world of government is formatted, and by whom, is of crucial importance for how power and influence is distributed in a {{political system}}. This study has carried out an analysis of one part of the informal structure of the EU and its relationship with the formal structure. Thus the focus of the study has been on <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> and their primary instigator-the Commission. In this framework three questions have been raised. Firstly, taking into account the Commission's tight to set up <b>expert</b> <b>groups,</b> to what extent is this tool used and what type of <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> ere set up?

40|$|This paper {{answers the}} {{following}} question: Do the uncertainty and salience of issues {{determine whether the}} European Commission will use an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> to assist with policy formulation? Using rationalist theory, three hypotheses test whether transversality, the importance of standard-setting and the salience of a policy proposal determine whether a Commission DG will ask an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> to assist in preparing that same proposal. Data was retrieved from official docu-ments via EUR-Lex. A binary logistic regression analysis has been conducted on a sample of 260 proposals that were drafted by DG Climate Action, DG Communications Networks, Content & Technology, DG Environment and DG Internal Market and Services. All proposals were adopted between 2010 and 2013. The empirical analysis shows that <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> involvement in policy formulation is neither negligible nor ubiquitous in terms of frequency as <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> as-sisted in preparing 33. 5 % of the proposals. DGs {{were significantly more likely}} to consult an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> when the pro-posal under preparation was more transversal in nature and/or when that proposal treated standard-setting more pro-nouncedly. In contrast, the salience of a proposal was shown to be insignificantly related to the presence of an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> during policy formulation...|$|R
