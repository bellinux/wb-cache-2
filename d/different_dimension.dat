5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a <b>different</b> <b>dimension</b> and {{described}} the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but {{the appearance of a}}n older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to return}} to Another world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, {{allowing}} him {{to return to}} his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, Another world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger, visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past. The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to pull in a counterbalance from a <b>different</b> <b>dimension.</b> This was Dinopolis, a city of Dragonians—parallel universe descendants of Chrono Triggers Reptites. The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.|$|E

500|$|Analysing Ranaut's career, the {{journalist}} Parmita Uniyal, in 2014, noted that she [...] "loves to challenge herself with tricky roles and manages {{to add a}} <b>different</b> <b>dimension</b> to her character every time." [...] A reviewer for Rediff.com described her as a [...] "director's actress" [...] who is susceptible to both [...] "shine and crumble under the right/wrong guidance". Anand L Rai (the director of Tanu Weds Manu) says that Ranaut actively pursues roles in which she can [...] "work in her own space and not become a mere prop in the male-dominated Bollywood". Alongside actress Vidya Balan, Ranaut has been credited for spearheading a movement that breaks stereotypes of a Hindi film heroine by playing the protagonist in films not starring a well-known male star. Following the success of Queen and Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Deccan Chronicle labelled her as [...] "one of the most bankable actresses in the industry", and Daily News and Analysis reported that she had {{emerged as one of}} the highest-paid actresses in Bollywood.|$|E
500|$|The first {{dimension}} {{visited by}} the Avatar is a prison tower in [...] "Fyrna", {{which has been}} conquered by goblins led by the Guardian. There, the player rescues a human resistance leader named Bishop, who then returns to lead a rebellion against the Guardian. Back at the castle, the player gives a small blackrock gem obtained in the prison tower to Nystul, who enchants it to disrupt the portal in the sewers. Next, the player visits Killorn Keep, a floating fortress in a <b>different</b> <b>dimension.</b> Altara, a sorceress in Killorn Keep who is allied with Bishop, warns the Avatar that the Guardian has hidden a magical spy beneath the castle in Britannia. She provides a special dagger with which to kill it. After removing the spy, the Avatar visits a dimension of ice caves: {{the remnants of a}} civilization destroyed by the Guardian, now ruled by a ghost named Beatrice. The Avatar returns to the castle and finds that Lady Tory has been murdered by the traitor. The next dimension is Talorus, a world inhabited by energy beings called [...] "Talorids" [...] that each serve a single purpose, such as knowing only the past or producing runestones. Talorids are created to serve the Guardian, but the Avatar destroys and replaces the sole reproductive Talorid to free the race.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't as tight as a Stax drummer ... his rolls would clatter about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very <b>different</b> <b>dimension</b> in Hendrix's playing".|$|E
500|$|Radical Dreamers preceded Chrono Cross, a full {{role-playing}} {{video game}} sequel to Chrono Trigger. Masato Kato cited {{the desire to}} [...] "redo Radical Dreamers properly" [...] as the genesis of Cross, attributing the latter's serious atmosphere {{to the influence of}} Dreamers. Kato's desire to finish the story of the characters Kid and Serge principally shaped the plot of Cross. Chrono Cross borrowed certain thematic elements, story points, characters, music, and objects introduced in Radical Dreamers—including the infiltration of Viper Manor, the Frozen Flame, the name Radical Dreamers for Kid's thievery, and the characters of Kid, Lynx, and Serge (who became a non-speaking protagonist). Though these characters and items were not presented in the same context, their general traits survived the transition. Gil, confirmed by Kato to be Magus, was also going to be featured in Chrono Cross. This idea was scrapped due to difficulties in representing the story of Magus among the game's numerous other characters; the unrelated, enigmatic magician Guile was created instead. Since the release of Chrono Cross, Radical Dreamers is considered an alternate continuity of the Chrono series. Chrono Cross addressed this through an easter egg hinting that Radical Dreamers took place in a <b>different</b> <b>dimension.</b> In the English version of Chrono Cross, this easter egg refers to Gil as [...] "Magil". Kato intended Dreamers and Cross to prompt players to pursue their personal dreams in life.|$|E

2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} about is the trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core principles of the Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. We should remember that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether <b>different</b> <b>dimension</b> of being.|$|E
2500|$|Interpretations of The Matrix often {{reference}} Baudrillard's {{philosophy to}} demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays {{from the end of the}} 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel. Bracha Ettinger's matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression [...] "primal matrix" [...] but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their [...] "co-birthing" [...] in a womb-like [...] "shareable time-space", their co-existence in <b>different</b> <b>dimension</b> at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her [...] "archaic" [...] matrix is always in the now and the future, it depends on human affects and desires and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the mechanical coded simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of [...] "transconnectedness" [...] in proximity and in distance, which is not global and can't form a [...] "web of webs". Its webs are always specific, invested by an [...] "Eros of borderlinking" [...] and related to different processes that Ettinger has named [...] "metramorphosis" [...] (feminine-maternal-material morpheus). This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.|$|E
