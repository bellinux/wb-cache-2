50|$|ATR is a serine/threonine-specific {{protein kinase}} that is {{involved}} in sensing DNA damage and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest. ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA, which is a common intermediate formed during DNA <b>damage</b> <b>detection</b> and repair. Single-stranded DNA occurs at stalled replication forks and as an intermediate in DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair. ATR works with a partner protein called ATRIP to recognize single-stranded DNA coated with RPA. Once ATR is activated, it phosphorylates Chk1, initiating a signal transduction cascade that culminates in cell cycle arrest. In addition to its role in activating the DNA damage checkpoint, ATR is thought to function in unperturbed DNA replication.|$|E
40|$|Structural damage {{identification}} {{is to determine}} the structure health status and analyze the test results. The three key problems to be solved are as follows: the existence of damage in structure, to detect the damage location, and to confirm the damage degree or damage form. Damage generally changes the structure physical properties (i. e., stiffness, mass, and damping) corresponding with the modal characteristics of the structure (i. e., natural frequencies, modal shapes, and modal damping). The research results show that strain mode can be more sensitive and effective for local damage. The direct index method of <b>damage</b> location <b>detection</b> is based on difference theory, without the modal parameter of the original structure. FEM numerical simulation to partial crack with different degree is done. The criteria of <b>damage</b> location <b>detection</b> can be obtained by strain mode difference curve through cubic spline interpolation. Also the genetic algorithm box in Matlab is used. It has been possible to identify the damage to a reasonable level of accuracy...|$|R
30|$|While {{surface damage}} is {{relatively}} easy to detect because many existing techniques, such as optical scanning, are available to use, subsurface damage is rather hard to detect since such a damage is often hidden in the subsurface at a certain depth. There are many types of subsurface damage, such as cracks, residual stress, porosities, phase transformation, amorphization, among which cracks are most detrimental and directly determine performance and lifetime of a part. Both destructive and non-destructive methods have also been developed for subsurface <b>damage</b> <b>detections.</b> Destructive methods include taper-polishing, cross-sectional microscopy, and etching, whereas non-destructive methods are X-ray scanning, laser scattering, and ultrasonic probing, etc. In comparison with the non-destructive methods, the destructive methods have better reliability and accuracy. However, the destructive methods need to destroy the part, do not provide global damage information of the part, and are time-consuming in sample preparation. On the other hand, non-destructive methods can realize in-process detection without the above drawbacks, and may greatly reduce cost, and improve efficiency and quality for machining. The major problem associated with the non-destructive methods is the detection accuracy and efficiency which need to be improved.|$|R

50|$|Typical MUDs {{and other}} {{predecessor}} games {{were limited to}} about 64 or 256 simultaneous player connections; this was a limit imposed by the underlying operating system, which was usually Unix-like. One of the bigger problems with the modern engines has been handling the vast number of players. Since a typical server can handle around 10,000-12,000 players, 4000-5000 active simultaneously, dividing the game into several servers has up until now been the solution. This approach has also helped with technical issues, such as lag, that many players experience. Another difficulty, especially relevant to real-time simulation games, is time synchronization across {{hundreds or thousands of}} players. Many games rely on time synchronization to drive their physics simulation as well as their scoring and <b>damage</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Observations in the {{literature}} survey regarding the different damage models are similar, i.e., they are not generic. In spite of considerable progress in the damage identification using vibrationbased methods, there is still lack of a fairly successful algorithm todetect damage as concluded in all the reviews since 1995. In 1995,in the review published by Dimarogonas (1996), it is concluded “Aconsistent cracked beam vibration theory {{is yet to be}} developed”.In 2005, in another review about vibration based structural healthmonitoring, Carden and Fanning (2004) conclude, “There is no universalagreement as to the optimum method for using measured vibration data for <b>damage</b> <b>detection,</b> location or quantification”.Similarly in 2007, Montalvao et al. (2006) state as one of the conclusions,“There is no general algorithm that allows the resolutionof all kinds of problems in all kinds of structures”. Similar trendregarding lack of generality of proposed models is seen in the latestreview by Fan and Qiao (2010).|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{implementing}} a <b>damage</b> <b>detection</b> and characterization strategy for engineering structures {{is referred to}} as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of a structural system, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. The SHM process involves the observation of a system over time using periodically sampled dynamic response measurements from an array of sensors, the extraction of damage-sensitive features from these measurements, and the statistical analysis of these features to determine the current state of system health. For long term SHM, the output of this process is periodically updated information regarding the ability of the structure to perform its intended function in light of the inevitable aging and degradation resulting from operational environments. After extreme events, such as earthquakes or blast loading, SHM is used for rapid condition screening and aims to provide, in near real time, reliable information regarding the integrity of the structure.|$|E

40|$|Many {{metallic}} {{structural and}} non-structural parts {{used in the}} transportation industry can be replaced by textile-reinforced composites. Composites made from a polymeric matrix and fibrous reinforcement have been increasingly studied during the last decade. On the other hand, the fast development of smart textile structures {{seems to be a}} very promising solution for in situ structural health monitoring of composite parts. In order to optimize composites’ quality and their lifetime all the production steps have to be monitored in real time. Textile sensors embedded in the composite reinforcement and having the same mechanical properties as the yarns used to make the reinforcement exhibit actuating and sensing capabilities. This paper presents a new generation of textile fibrous sensors based on the conductive polymer complex poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) -poly(styrenesulfonate) developed by an original roll to roll coating method. Conductive coating for yarn treatment was defined according to the preliminary study of percolation threshold of this polymer complex. The percolation threshold determination was based on conductive dry films’ electrical properties analysis, in order to develop highly sensitive sensors. A novel laboratory equipment was designed and produced for yarn coating to ensure effective and equally distributed coating of electroconductive polymer without distortion of textile properties. The electromechanical properties of the textile fibrous sensors confirmed their suitability for in situ structural <b>damages</b> <b>detection</b> of textile reinforced thermoplastic composites in real time...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{experimental}} and analytical researches {{have been conducted}} in NTU to investigate the effectiveness of various kinds of unbonding material, the brace-to-gusset connection details, analytical models and the design procedures for the buckling restrained braces (BRBs). Tests conducted on more than 50 specimens confirm that the proposed BRBs employing double steel cores encased in twin steel tubes and infill concrete can stably sustain severe inelastic cyclic axial strain reversals. The double-cored BRBs can be conveniently connected to the gusset plate as in the traditional double-tee brace to gusset plate connections. Experiments include cyclic tests of BRB components and large scale single bay V-shaped buckling restrained braced frames (BRBFs). Test {{results indicate that the}} 2 mm thick silicon rubber sheets are effective in minimizing the difference between the cyclic peak compressive and tensile forces of the BRBs. The three V-shaped BRBF tests confirm that the steel brace core strain demands can be satisfactorily predicted from the story drift demand by geometry and incorporating the inelastic core length ratio. Test results also reveal that at a large story drift, the tensile strain in the tension brace was always greater than the compressive strain in the compression brace. This paper also introduces fully detachable BRB designs, non-destructive evaluation techniques for <b>damage</b> <b>detections</b> of BRBs. Finally, the paper concludes with the applications of the proposed BRBs in seismic retrofit as well as new construction projects in Taiwan.
