5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the <b>file</b> <b>to</b> the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E

However, attempts to communicate with her fail, as a translator insists the woman is speaking a wholly unknown language.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro was shortlisted {{receiving}} a 6.4score, {{according to a}} study of its Application File delivered to the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. As a Candidate city, Rio de Janeiro submitted its Candidature <b>File</b> <b>to</b> the IOC on February 11, 2009. The dossier was analyzed by the IOC Evaluation Commission, which arrived in the city on April 27, 2009, to assess the quality of the bid. Between April 29 and May 2, the Commission attended technical presentations and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city, giving a favorable assessment in its final report.|$|E

5|$|According to Amineri, {{one of the}} mod's core developers, initial {{versions}} of Long War used changes to the game's configuration <b>file</b> <b>to</b> change content in the game. After other mod makers that {{were not part of}} the Long War project discovered how to make changes to the game by directly working with its Unreal Engine, more significant game alterations became possible, and the forums of NexusMods became a hub where such changes were exchanged. Many of the mod's key features, including the increased number of soldiers and the lengthened campaign, first appeared in version beta 1.9, which was released in mid 2013. Shortly after Enemy Within released, Amineri and XMarksTheSpot completed development of a Java-based tool called upkmodder that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod. In the late stages of the mod's development, the team worked directly with the Unreal Development Kit.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio <b>file</b> <b>to</b> South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open <b>file</b> <b>to</b> attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case <b>file</b> <b>to</b> a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and <b>file</b> <b>to</b> confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro bid to {{host the}} 1936, 2004 and the 2012 Games, but failed on every occasion; missing the {{shortlist}} in the two latest attempts, while the bidding process for 1936 did not follow the current standards. For {{the first time in}} the Candidature phase, the official bid flag was raised during a ceremony held at the Palácio da Cidade (English: City's Palace) on June 23, 2008, celebrating the Olympic Day. On July 3, 2008, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid a fee of USD 500,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Procedure, reconfirming its acceptance of the rules. Then, Rio officials participated in the Olympic Games Observers Program from August 8 to 24, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; and attended the IOC Official Debriefing of the Beijing Games from November 24 to 27, in London, United Kingdom. On February 11, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee delivered its Candidature <b>File</b> <b>to</b> the IOC in Lausanne and, eight days later, to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in Bonn, Germany; containing the responses to the 2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire, as well as guarantees and undertakings. The Candidature File had three volumes containing 568 pages of detailed answers to 300 technical questions, divided into 17 themes. Finally, on June 17, 2009, the IOC organized the 2016 Candidate Cities Briefing to 93 of its members at the Olympic Museum, being the first such meeting in its history and the most important before the election. Rio officials came out stronger after a presentation of 45 minutes, considered to be exceptional, followed by a session of 16 questions.|$|E
