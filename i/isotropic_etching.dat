25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching</b> or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

The etchant may be a corrosive liquid or a chemically active ionized gas, known as a plasma. Unlike dry etching, <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching</b> does not etch in a single direction, but rather etches horizontally as well as vertically into {{the surface of the}} substrate.

40|$|Dry etching {{of silicon}} is an {{important}} process in the manufacturing of integrated circuits and micromachined devices. Traditionally, the etch rate limiting step for an <b>isotropic</b> silicon <b>etching</b> process {{is considered to be}} the arrival of fluorine atoms directly from the gas phase onto the silicon surface, and the mechanism to promote anisotropy is the prevention of lateral etching by the formation of an inhibiting layer on the vertical walls. Furthermore, <b>isotropic</b> dry <b>etching</b> is considered to etch features {{in the same way as}} <b>isotropic</b> wet <b>etching.</b> Conventional mechanisms cannot explain, however, the perfect anisotropic etching of silicon with pure SF 6, when no polymer is formed. Neither can it be understood how a deep (> 50 µm), <b>isotropic,</b> dry <b>etching</b> process applied to silicon can result in structures with a pinched neck and sharp ridges, in contrast with a wet etching process, where the corners are rounded and no pinching of the neck is observed.

This micro-fabrication process combines both bulk and surface micromachining, which include the <b>isotropic</b> wet <b>etching,</b> a novel mask design, the thick photo resist coating and exposure, and high-aspect-ratio curved sacrificial technique. In <b>isotropic</b> wet <b>etching</b> of a hemispherical cavity, the optimal concentration of etchant is experimentally determined along with adequate ultrasonic vibration during wet etching to produce the circle-like of hemispherical cavity.

Also, for a deep hemispherical cavity larger than 100 µm, the traditional photo resist can not be coated on the corner surface well. The thick photo resist, AZ 4620, is found to be able to overcome this problem and be successfully exposed all through its bottom surface. Furthermore, the deposited sacrificial layer materials (PSG) on this cavity will usually result in thinner layer near the corner. In addition, the curved gap of PSG layer has the feature with high-aspect-ratio. These make the PSG etching difficult.

Therefore, etching a rectangular hole in a (100)-Si wafer results in a pyramid shaped etch pit with 54.7° walls, instead of a hole with curved sidewalls as with <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching.</b>|$|E

A common type of dry etching is reactive-ion etching. Unlike with many (but not all, see <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching)</b> of the wet chemical etchants used in wet etching, the dry etching process typically etches directionally or anisotropically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{isotropic}} dry {{plasma etching}} {{was used to}} release the suspended SiO 2 microcantilever from the substrate of SOI wafer. Employing the plasma dry etching technique, the frontside etching for the SiO 2 microcantilever release is done using the Oxford Plasmalab System 100. To obtain the optimum condition for the microcantilever release using the plasma etcher, the etching parameters involved are 100 sccm of SF 6 flow, 2000 W of capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) power, 3 W of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) power, 20 ºC of etching temperature and 30 mTorr chamber pressure. The optimum parameters yield lateral etch rate of about 5 μm/min and vertical etch rate of about 8 μm/min. Two etching methods have been considered in this study. The first method employs only the <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching</b> to realize the microcantilever release while the second method utilizes both the anisotropic etching and the <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching.</b> For the second method, the process starts with the anisotropic etching from the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) system which is then followed by the <b>isotropic</b> <b>etching</b> to complete the microcantilever releasing process.
