5|$|Federer {{entered the}} 2009 season with 13 Grand Slams, only one behind Pete Sampras' all-time record. The season {{began with a}} loss to Nadal in the finals of the Australian Open in a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> five-set match. Federer {{struggled}} following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty {{stated that}} the {{location}} of the institutions would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested.</b> As a temporary compromise, the institutions were provisionally located in the City of Luxembourg, despite the Assembly being based in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|On {{election}} day, despite increasing his popular {{share of}} the vote over the 1883 election even with lower turnout, Porter was defeated by Hughes. The race was very tight and <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> nearly ending in a tie vote. Hughes captured the electoral district {{by a margin of}} eight votes winning just over 51% of the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
5|$|Marcelo {{was voted}} {{as the first}} Philippine Idol, {{amassing}} about 35.26% of the vote. The vote was a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> one with the runners-up earning about 33.84% and 30.90% of the votes. It was not revealed, however, which runner-up garnered which percentage, but they each received ₱250,000. Aside from the title, Marcelo also earned a contract with Sony BMG Music Philippines, a management contract with an agency of FremantleMedia's choice, a ₱1,000,000 non-exclusive contract with ABC, and ₱1,000,000 cash prize.|$|E
5|$|With {{the roads}} {{becoming}} impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City {{for the winter}} of 1824–25, and thus {{was there for the}} climax of the <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> 1824 election, in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives. On 9 February 1825, that body selected Secretary of State John Quincy Adams as president; that evening, the runner-up, General Andrew Jackson, shook hands with Adams at the White House as Lafayette looked on.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E
5|$|Some {{licences}} {{have not}} been renewed; for example, the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill was forced to close in 1999, and landscaping is ongoing. The proposals dating from 1999 from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re-open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor {{have been seen as}} a test case. They are <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds that the development would threaten nearby Bronze Age remains, in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, as well as the natural landscape locally. As of 2007, negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry, a less sensitive area.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> {{status of}} O'Shaughnessy Dam in the {{environmental}} field, and occasional federal money set aside for studying alternatives to Hetch Hetchy – such as $7 million provided by President George W. Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems would have to be in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir would have to be drained by 2035.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
5|$|Mount ran for Congress in 2004 {{to succeed}} Chris John, who instead {{ran for the}} United States Senate but lost to Republican David Vitter. She {{positioned}} herself as a Conservative Democrat who supported balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran {{on a platform of}} preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested.</b>|$|E
5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In {{the two decades}} before World War II, the quest to break the land speed record was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested,</b> particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: the Liberty engine, Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the engine types used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{official}} mountain stages, three ended with climbs: stage 14 to Alpe di Pampeago, stage 15 to Passo Fedaia, and stage 19 to Presolana. Stage 20 earned its mountain designation {{by way of}} the Passo di Gavia and the Passo del Mortirolo, respectively the highest point reached and the steepest climb of this year's Giro. Two other stages had summit arrivals, stage 7 to Pescocostanzo and the demanding stage 16 climbing time trial to Plan de Corones, the summit of which the Giro had never before visited. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the race's last day, would keep the race <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> to the end.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and France are {{not part}} of the NATO E-3A Component, instead {{procuring}} E-3 aircraft through a joint project. The UK and France operate their E-3 aircraft independently of each other and of NATO. The UK operates six aircraft (with a seventh now retired) and France operates four aircraft, all fitted with the newer CFM56-2 engines. The British requirement came about following the cancellation of the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3 project to replace the Avro Shackleton AEW2 during the 1980s. The UK E-3 order was placed in February 1987, with deliveries starting in 1990. The other operator of the type, delivered between June 1986 and September 1987, is Saudi Arabia which operates five aircraft, all fitted with CFM56-2 engines. This particular sale was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> between the Reagan administration and opponents of the sale.|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away from the pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> presidential elections to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Darlington's {{first season}} as a renamed club, its main rivals were Spennymoor Town owing to the <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> title for the Northern League. Spennymoor Town had won the league for the three {{previous}} years, but had not applied for promotion until the 2012–13 season when Darlington entered the league. Spennymoor Town were the only club to contend with Darlington for the title {{towards the end of}} the season. To a lesser extent, landlords Bishop Auckland were also rivals owing to their shared home ground. In the 2014–15 season, Darlington once again locked horns with Spennymoor Town after they achieved promotion from the Northern League in 2014. Again, they contested Darlington for promotion in a semi-final playoff match that Darlington won 3–2. The rivalry with Spennymoor was re-ignited in 2017–18 when Spennymoor booked their place in the National League North, with the first game ending all square 1–1 at Blackwell Meadows on 28 August 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford {{was established in}} 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, a retired soldier {{in the service of}} the East India Company. He wished the university to establish a Sanskrit professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in Sanskrit at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested,</b> as the rivals each claimed to be best at fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of Sanskrit scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the professor from graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Boycott {{continued}} to play in his spectacles, and later switched to contact lenses. He feared his career would have ended had he not used such aids as his eyesight was poor. Boycott's initial appearances for Yorkshire failed to impress, and he was compared unfavourably to his main rival, John Hampshire. When Brian Close took over from Vic Wilson as captain of Yorkshire in 1963 he persuaded the committee to keep Boycott on, and was rewarded when, on 2 June 1963, Boycott scored 145 against Lancashire. His century was also part of a 249-run fourth wicket partnership which became a Yorkshire record. Boycott cemented {{his place in the}} Yorkshire XI in the 1963 season with successive scores of 76, 53, 49 not out and 50, and on 29 August made a century partnership in both innings of a match against Leicestershire with Ken Taylor. Boycott handed in his notice to the Ministry of Pensions that same year. After a brief loss of form he kept his place with scores of 62, 28 and 113 in the following matches. This second century again came against Lancashire, making Boycott the first Yorkshire cricketer to score his first two centuries in a Roses match, as the <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> Yorkshire versus Lancashire matches were termed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} began on 15 May and {{stretched}} from Rome to Florence. The racing {{that day was}} marred by heavy rain, which led to ten withdrawals. Carlo Galetti won the stage ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Dario Beni. The next leg was also dogged by rain and very poor conditions {{on the road and}} saw the climbing of the Colle de Bacco. Giovanni Gerbi was the first rider to summit the Colle de Bacco. The climb wore Gerbi out and he was caught and passed by three riders and ultimately finished fourth on the stage. Vincenzo Borgarello was the first rider to cross the finish line in Genoa and won the stage, where a large crowd waited for the riders to finish. Rossignoli took the race lead after finishing two positions in front of Galetti. The race's third day of racing was the first to have clear weather. Race leader Rossignoli bested the likes of Giovanni Gerbi and Carlo Durando to win the stage and consolidate his lead in the general classification. The next stage was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested,</b> with the peloton staying together for the whole stage as Carlo Galetti took the stage win.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the second Giro d'Italia began with a large send off in the start city of Milan. The finish in Udine was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> as five riders came {{to the finish line}} in a pack. Ernesto Azzini managed to out-sprint the other four riders in the leading group to win the stage. The next stage saw the first non-Italian stage winner {{in the history of the}} Giro d'Italia, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq. Dortignacq managed to {{breakaway}} from his fellow group member Carlo Galetti and then solo to the stage victory while five other riders chased close behind. Galetti's second-place finish on the stage was high enough for him to take the lead of the race. The French success enraged the Italian fans and led the competing riders to ban unite against the foreign riders. The third stage saw three major Italian riders, Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, and Eberardo Pavesi, and attack early on in the stage. The three riders then rode together all the way to the finish in Teramo. Galetti went on to win the stage, with Ganna and Pavesi following in quick succession.|$|E
25|$|As Secretary of State of a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> swing state, Blackwell {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the 2004 national election.|$|E
25|$|Farran {{ran for a}} seat to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral {{district}} of Calgary-North Hill, defeating Social Credit incumbent Robert Simpson and future MLA Barry Pashak, {{as well as an}} Independent candidate in a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> race to pick up the district for the Progressive Conservatives. The {{electoral district}} {{was one of the most}} <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> races in 1971, with just a spread of 0.53% separating Farran and Simpson.|$|E
25|$|Before 2001, {{the entire}} Sengkang Town and Punggol New Town {{were part of}} Cheng San Group Representation Constituency, which was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> in 1997 general election.|$|E
25|$|The last {{representative}} was Jonathan Dennis who won {{the district}} {{for the first time}} in the 2008 general election after facing a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> and controversial nomination battle against Craig Chandler.|$|E
25|$|Bonko ran for {{a second}} term in the 2008 general {{election}} but was defeated in a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> race by Progressive Conservative candidate Janice Sarich, who held the riding until 2015.|$|E
25|$|Rendell's popularity, {{particularly}} in the suburban ring of counties around Philadelphia, was a key to Kerry's victory in Pennsylvania, {{one of the most}} <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> swing states in the 2004 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} of Dunvegan-Central peace was created from Dunvegan in the 2004 boundary redistribution. The first {{election in the}} new district was <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> between Progressive Conservative Hector Goudreau and Dale Lueken from the Alberta Alliance.|$|E
25|$|The {{lands in}} the Peace River {{district}} experienced a great influx of settlers during this period. The 1913 election would be <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> with Conservative Alphaeus Patterson defeating future MLA William Rae and former Athabasca MLA William Bredin.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> {{by-election}} {{was held}} on June 12, 2007. The winner was Alberta Liberal candidate Craig Cheffins who managed an upset win over local business person Brian Henninger who owns a popular Toyota dealership in the riding.|$|E
25|$|Lieberman and Lamont {{fought a}} <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> and {{expensive}} primary {{battle for the}} Democratic nomination. Republican candidate Schlesinger gained his party's nomination through the Republican convention and raised and spent relatively little. Minor candidates' fundraising was almost nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|Their {{greatest}} {{success in}} one-day cricket {{was when they}} won the 2000 World Cup under captain Emily Drumm. In a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> final, they scored 184 to narrowly beat Australia by four runs, Australia being all out for 180.|$|E
25|$|Fyfe ran for {{re-election}} in 1982 and won the largest majority {{in the history of}} the district. She ran for a third term in the 1986 general election but was defeated by NDP candidate Bryan Strong in a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> race.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} the 1971 boundary redistribution. The first election held that year saw a <b>hotly</b> <b>contested</b> battle between Progressive Conservative candidate Merv Leitch and Social Credit candidate Pat O'Byrne. Leitch edged out O'Byrne to pick up the new district for his party.|$|E
