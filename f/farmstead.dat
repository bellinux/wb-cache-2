5|$|Knap of Howar Neolithic <b>farmstead</b> is {{probably}} the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated {{on the island of}} Papa Westray (which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic), the <b>farmstead</b> consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.|$|E
5|$|Opinions differ {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the name. One is the <b>farmstead</b> or {{village of}} a man named Aethelhere, an Old English personal name and the suffix tun, meaning an enclosure, <b>farmstead</b> or manor estate; another is adre, Saxon for little brook with the suffix tun. Either is possible as Atherton is bounded by brooks {{to the west and}} south, and crossed by several others. The western boundary is Hindsford Brook, originally named Goderic Brook after a Saxon saint.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's first schoolhouse {{opened in}} 1805 on the Thomson <b>farmstead.</b> In 1847 Egerton Ryerson {{recommended}} that 11 school districts be created. By 1904, 28 schools {{had been built}} throughout the township. In 1914, Agincourt Continuation School offered education from up to grade 12.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of unlimited water on <b>farmsteads</b> {{became an issue}} when the Government of Saskatchewan at length permitted the subdivision of farmsteads: when this became viable, numerous luxurious <b>farmsteads</b> became attractive venues for townspeople to set up summer homes on former Qu'Appelle district <b>farmsteads</b> with the former farms consolidated as large-scale commercial operations having no relationship whatever with their former <b>farmsteads.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} types of settlements at Langweiler. The sites {{can be divided into}} three groupings on the basis of size: single <b>farmsteads,</b> clusters of 2-3 <b>farmsteads</b> and II <b>farmsteads.</b> Each settlement had access to a portion of the valley floor, perhaps seasonal pasture for cattle and to the drier gravel terraces for farming.|$|R

5|$|The {{names of}} many of the other areas of Sheffield likely to have been {{established}} as settlements during this period end in ley, which signifies a clearing in the forest, or ton, which means an enclosed <b>farmstead.</b> These settlements include Heeley, Longley, Norton, Owlerton, Southey, Tinsley, Totley, Wadsley, and Walkley.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to various Mainland {{sites such as}} Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray, and a burnt mound and <b>farmstead</b> on Auskerry.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch, an {{earthwork}} {{stretching from}} Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, {{is evidence of}} Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries {{and may have been}} used as a boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from Old English such as -tun, meaning <b>farmstead,</b> and leah meaning clearing.|$|E
50|$|Llansaint is {{a village}} of <b>farmsteads</b> and cottages that is located in Carmarthenshire, Wales. It {{includes}} a cluster of 19th century stone-built houses around the church, and it is surrounded by <b>farmsteads</b> and modern residential development.|$|R

5|$|Pennington was {{recorded}} as Pininton and Pynynton in 1246 and 1360, Penynton in 1305, Pynyngton in 1351 and 1442 and Penyngton in 1443, the ending tun denotes an enclosure, <b>farmstead</b> or manor in Old English. The ford of Beda, probably through the Pennington Brook gave {{its name to}} Bedford which {{was recorded}} as Beneford from 1200–21 and Bedeford in 1200 and 1296.|$|E
5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 9th century saw a wave of Norse (Viking) {{settlers}} and the subsequent establishment of the Danelaw. The names of hamlets established by these settlers often end in thorpe, which means a <b>farmstead.</b> Examples of such settlements in the Sheffield area are Grimesthorpe, Hackenthorpe, Jordanthorpe, Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Waterthorpe, and Woodthorpe. By 918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to Edward the Elder, and by 926 Northumbria was under the control of King Æthelstan.|$|E
5|$|A charred {{hazelnut}} shell, {{recovered in}} 2007 during excavations in Tankerness on the Mainland has been dated to 6820–6660 BC indicating {{the presence of}} Mesolithic nomadic tribes. The earliest known permanent settlement is at Knap of Howar, a Neolithic <b>farmstead</b> {{on the island of}} Papa Westray, which dates from 3500 BC. The village of Skara Brae, Europe's best-preserved Neolithic settlement, {{is believed to have been}} inhabited from around 3100 BC. Other remains from that era include the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Maeshowe passage grave, the Ring of Brodgar and other standing stones. Many of the Neolithic settlements were abandoned around 2500 BC, possibly due to changes in the climate.|$|E

5|$|Applewood Farm is a <b>farmstead</b> in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, the {{farmhouse}} was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, {{the farmhouse}}, corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the area {{stretches}} back up to 10,000 years; there are 22 Mesolithic sites in Tameside, the oldest dating to around 8000BC; 21 of the 22 sites are in the hilly uplands in the north east of the borough. Evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age activity is more limited in the borough, although the Bronze Age Stalybridge Cairn is the most complete prehistoric funerary monument in the borough. The {{people in the area}} changed from hunter-gatherers to farmers around 2500BC1500BC due to climate change. Werneth Low is the most likely Iron Age <b>farmstead</b> site in the borough, probably dating to the late 1st millenniumBC. Before the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st centuryAD, the area was probably part of the territory of the Brigantes, the Celtic tribe controlling most of what is now north west England.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} small finds of Roman coins {{throughout}} the Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins {{were found at}} a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along {{with the name of}} the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation {{that there may have been}} a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian <b>farmstead</b> site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of England, the pattern of {{dispersed}} settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in Domesday may be dispersed <b>farmsteads.</b> It is sometimes possible to identify documentary references to <b>farmsteads</b> in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{establishing}} common characteristics for detecting small <b>farmsteads</b> of the Archaic and Classical-Lucanian period (600 - 325 BC), based on location choice and pottery assemblage. I used {{the information from}} the ‘Carta Archeologica della Valle del Sinni’, by Quilici and Quilici-Gigli, in which the results of an archaeological research, undertaken between 1996 and 2003, are listed. The reason for my research is that in the adjacent GIA research area in the Raganello watershed area, no Archaic or Classical-Lucanian <b>farmsteads</b> were found. It was unclear whether they were not detected, or simply not there. Therefore, I wanted {{to find a way to}} identify them in the modern landscape, and used the database from the Sinni research to find specific characteristics for Archaic and Classical-Lucanian <b>farmsteads.</b> This resulted in a model for the rural landscape for the Archaic period as a village-based society with only very few isolated <b>farmsteads,</b> and for the Classical-Lucanian period as a farm-based society with many <b>farmsteads</b> located on fertile soils, near a central market place. ...|$|R
5|$|There was {{an ancient}} <b>farmstead</b> from the 1st {{century to the}} 3rd century in the Upminster area, and {{agriculture}} was the predominant industry throughout the following centuries. The area was once wooded, but clearances in the 12th century gave more land over to arable farming; and by the 17th century there were a variety of crops and livestock. There was a growth in market gardening in the 19th century. There {{have been a number}} of windmills in Upminster and one of which, a smock mill built in 1803, remains. Local industry included a tannery, gravel extraction and a brick works that was connected to the railway station by a tramway in 1895.|$|E

US40Alternate passes the Stonebraker and Harbaugh-Shafer Building and intersects MD17 (Church Street) within the Middletown Historic District. The highway passes through the Airview Historic District before leaving the town limits.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his <b>farmstead,</b> leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
