40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} directive speech acts and metaphors in the Javanese Proverbs. In order to fulfill this goal, the researcher identifies the structural forms, the communicative function, the felicity {{conditions and the}} metaphor mapping. The felicity condition will explore four components: a) propositional content, b) preparatory condition, c) sincerity condition, and d) essential rule. Besides, the metaphor mapping will identify three components: a) objects/ idea, b) meaning, and c) mapping process. The current research would be designed as qualitative research. The researcher had choosen the purposive proverbs {{from the collection of}} Pitutur Luhur Budaya Jawa (has been composed by certain writers). Due to the investigation, the researcher found some findings:a) there would be two structural forms of the Javanese proverbs (declarative and imperative), b) there were four communicative functions or directive speech acts in the proverbs (prohibition, requirement, command, and suggestion), c) the researcher found that the Javanese proverbs contain the direct and indirect speech act. Beside those findings, the researcher also investigates certain animals and plants (as metaphorical expressions or idea) in the Javanese proverbs such as 1) kebo gupak (buffalo) and tiger (macan) as the people whose bad behaviour, 2) gagak (crow), timun (cucumber), and ant (semut) as the poorer/the weaker people, 3) merak (peacock), duren (<b>king</b> <b>fruit),</b> and elephant (gajah) as the richer people/ the stronger people, 4) mushroom (jamur) as the best result, 5) watang (stalk) as the difficult step or effort, 6) snake (ula) as the figures/ common people, 7) candlenut (kemiri), 8) bebek (duck), 9) kidang (deer). ...|$|E

As the host resistance is compatible with other methods of control, therefore, this verdict may guide the orchardists to develop an integrated disease management programme. Keeping this in view, a survey {{was carried out in}} Gangetic West Bengal during the year 2004 to 2006, and screened twenty varieties of mango of three to five years bearing plant for tolerance against floral malformation. Susceptibility rating was done using 0 to 5 scale and the host-taxa were classified to their response to the pathogen. It was found that among the taxa, Mallika was recorded to be the most susceptible against floral malformation and Kishan Bhog was the least.

Therefore, incidence and damage caused by D. mangiferae on mango verities hapus, grafted and hybrids have been studied from Kolhapur district during the years 2011 - 2013. The pest occurred on the crop in December and caused extensive damage to crop by sucking cell sap from tender leaves, stem, flowering and fruiting bodies which resulted in extensive fall of flowering and fruiting bodies. The Mealy bug population was associated with crop up to ripening of fruits which disfigured and made the fruits insipid in the Kolhapur region. Hapus, grafted and other hybrid verities of Mango were equally susceptible to Mealy bug attack in the region. Preventive control measures are suggested in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{different}} organics on germination {{and growth of}} mango stones Mango (Mangifera indica L.), the <b>king</b> of tropical <b>fruits</b> occupies an important place among the fruit crops grown in India. Mango is highly cross-pollinated crop, {{as a result there}} is enormous variation in the seedlings raised from the fruits of single tree. Rootstocks are always seedling origin irrespective of zygotic / nucellar nature. In semi-arid regions the mango stones are available during the drier parts of the year (April- June) because of which the germination percentage and vigor is very low. Synchronization and rapid seed emergence are the benefits of bioformulations or organics on germination and seedling growth. The significant enhancement of germination was noticed in different pre-soaking treatments by Padma and Narayana Reddy (1998) and Venkat Rao, (2002) in mango. Higher germination percentage of mango stones is the main criterion and strong base for successful grafts.

Six-week old female Sprague–Dawley albino rats were divided into three groups of 10 rats each. The feeding of 5 % powder of the fruiting bodies of Pleurotus eryngii to hypercholesterolemic rats reduced their plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, total lipid, phospholipids, and LDL/HDL ratio by 24. 05 %, 46. 33 %, 62. 50 %, 24. 63 %, 19. 22 %, and 57. 14 %, respectively. Mushroom also significantly reduced body weight in hypercholesterolemic rats. However, it had no adverse effects on plasma albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, glucose, total protein, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, inorganic phosphate, magnesium, and enzyme profiles. Feeding mushroom increased total lipid and cholesterol excretion in feces. The plasma lipoprotein fraction, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, indicated that P. eryngii significantly reduced plasma β and pre-β-lipoprotein, while increased α-lipoprotein. A histological study of hepatic cells by conventional hematoxylin–eosin and oil red O staining showed normal findings for mushroom-fed hypercholesterolemic rat. The present study suggests that 5 % P. eryngii diet supplement provided health benefits by acting on the atherogenic lipid profile in hypercholesterolaemic rats.

40|$|Abstract – In India both dairy {{and fruit}} sectors face {{problems}} {{of lack of}} basic infrastructure for han-dling peaks in production. Mango is considered as <b>king</b> of the <b>fruits,</b> but its production is highly seasonal. Lack of adequate infrastructure in many places results in huge losses due to low keeping quality. In the dairy industry, buttermilk, a by-product of butter production, is mostly left unutilized. Buttermilk is {{a good source of}} valuable milk proteins and lactose; its high phospholipids content makes dried buttermilk a good functional ingredient in food formulations. In this study, blends with different levels of mango juice and buttermilk were spray dried viz., 5 : 95, 10 : 90, 15 : 85 and 20 : 80 at feed temperature of 40 – 55 °C and compressed air pressure of 68 – 170 kPa. It was observed that the various processing parameters such as outlet air temperature, total solids and blend proportions {{had a profound effect on}} the characteristics of the resultant powder. The viscosity of blends increased with an increase in the mango juice proportion in the blend. High acid content of the blends had no negative effect on thermal stability of the blends before and after spray drying. This is probably due to the fact that a relatively low feed temperature (45 °C) was used and the exposure of the blends to high temperatures was only momentary during drying process. It was found that increments in the inclusion of mango solids had a positive effect on the resultant yield of powder...|$|R

40|$|The mango fruit {{not only}} has {{wonderful}} taste, flavor and nutritional values but also has anticancer and anti-viral activities. It is therefore, very popular and is recognized as <b>king</b> of the <b>fruits.</b> Mango fruit {{is also one of}} the cash crops of Pakistan that stands at 5 th position among the main mango producing countries. However, its pre and postharvest wastage is quiet high due to short shelf life and vulnerable to various microorganism. Therefore, the objective of this work was to prolong the shelf life and to improve the quality of the fruit by applying various strategies. For the purpose two commercial varieties of mango namely, Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa were selected for the study. The impact of controlled atmosphere ripening was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage and stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. The results obtained for various quality parameters (QP) as well as shelf life of the fruit were compared with the fruit ripened at the tree (under normal conditions). It was observed that the tree ripened fruit was better in quality than the fruit ripened at different storage temperature after harvesting. The fruit took longer time for its ripening at the tree compared to storage at 30 and 40 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. The shelf life was longest for the mangoes stored at 20 â€žaC compared to others, including tree ripened fruit. However, the waste percent was highest at tree ripened fruit as compared to stored fruit, irrespective of temperature and variety. These parameters were significantly different in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The results obtained for various quality parameters of the fruit harvested at hard green stage of maturity from different (orientation) side of the tree East, West, North and South showed that the quality was best and waste percent was lowest for the fruit harvested from south (sun exposure time for the fruit was maximum) orientation of tree; the shelf life was longer and weight loss percent was lower for North direction compared to others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The values of QP for the fruit harvested from South were significantly different from other treatments in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The fruit was harvested three (6. 30 am, 1. 30 pm and 8. 30 pm) times a day and was stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. It was concluded that the quality of the ripened fruit was highest for 8. 30 pm harvest time and stored at 40 â€žaC. The fruit harvested at 6. 30 am and stored at 20 â€žaC had lowest quality and weight loss but longest shelf life, whereas the fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and stored at 40 â€žaC had shortest shelf life and highest weight loss, irrespective of the variety. On the other hand, the waste percent was highest for fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and 20 â€žaC storage temperature and lowest for 6. 30 am harvest time and stored at 30 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. However, the quality and the shelf life were improved by coating the fruit with calcium chloride, respective of harvest time plus storage temperature and irrespective of the variety. The impact of harvest stages and storage conditions over the postharvest quality and shelf life of mango fruit was explored by measuring the QP for the fruit harvested at 80 (early stage), 95 (mid stage) and 110 (late stage) days after the fruit setting and stored at three different storage temperature showed a significant impact over the quality characteristics. The waste percentage, weight loss, pH, total soluble solids, carotenoids and total sugar were increased with the storage time/ ripening process, irrespective of maturity stages; while the percentage of acidity and vitamin-C was decreased with storage time. The total sugar contents were highest in later stage whereas, vitamin C and acidity were highest in fruit harvested at early stage whereas; the waste percentage was lowest for mid stage harvest. The weight loss was higher and shelf life was longer for early stage harvest. The ripening rate increased and the shelf life decreased with rise in storage temperature. The total soluble solids, sugar contents and carotenoids had positive correlation with the skin color, irrespective of stage, variety and temperature. The contribution of cooling of the fruit towards the enhancement of quality and prolonging the shelf life was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage of maturity and maintaining at 15 Â¡Â³C (by keeping in cold water and/ or in cold air) for different time periods. The fruit was then stored at 20, 30 and 40 oC till ripening. The quality parameters obtained were correlated with pre-storage cooling treatment. It was concluded that the impact of heat removed of the fruit was significantly different in most of the cases under the limit of P Æ’Â¬ 0. 05. It was also observed that the removal of heat from the fruit enhanced the quality, prolongs shelf life and minimize wastage, irrespective of the variety and storage temperatures. The quality of mango fruit was investigated as related with pedicle (stalk) lengths of the fruit. The fruit was harvested at hard green stage of maturity with 0. 5, 2. 5, 4. 5 and 6. 5 cm pedicle (stalk) lengths and stored at 30 Â¡Â³C till ripening. The result showed that the fruit harvested with 4. 5 cm stalk length was better among the investigated treatment for quality and shelf life. The weight loss and waste percent during ripening process of mango fruit was higher for 0. 5 cm stalks and lower for 4. 5 cm stalk, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The impact of coating over the quality and shelf life of mango (Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa) fruit was investigated in detail. For this purpose, several coating materials like starch, olive oil, beeswax, sodium benzoate, coconut oil, natural ghee (clarified butter) and potassium metabisulphite were evaluated. The fruit was harvested at hard green stage of maturity, coated and stored at various temperatures with control till ripening. The data showed that the coating had significant impact over the quality and shelf life of the fruit in most of the cases under the limit of P Æ’Â¬ 0. 05. Shelf life was longest with minimum weight loss and waste percent in natural ghee (clarified butter) and beeswax. Quality was higher in case of natural ghee and starch based coating than others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. Overall the shelf life was longest and waste percent was lowest in Samar Bahisht Chaunsa as compared to Langra mango variety, irrespective of the treatment...|$|R
40|$|Mango is {{considered}} the <b>king</b> of tropical <b>fruit</b> due to its appealing color and flavor. It is also considered {{as the most important}} fruit of Asia. The fruit currently ranks fifth in the world production with the Philippines included among the ranks of top mango producers. Mango is recommended {{to be included in the}} daily diet of consumers due to its richness in antioxidants. Mango, however, has a short shelf life, which requires cold storage to preserve quality and extend shelf stability. In addition, application of cold storage is also very limited as storage below optimal temperature for a sufficient time induces chilling injury (CI). This condition limits the postharvest preservation and marketing potential of mango, which consequently affects the export potential of mango to distant markets. CI is classified as a physiological disorder, which is characterized by grayish scald like discoloration and pitting in the peel, followed by uneven ripening and poor flavor and color development. CI, like other physiological disorders, is the result of imbalances in metabolism which are greatly affected by respiration and gas transport. This underlines the importance of three-dimensional (3 -D) microstructure and pore network in the development of CI. The absence of a technique to completely control CI reflects the lack of sufficient understanding on the changes prior to the visual appearance of the symptoms and the need to unravel the mechanism of tissue breakdown due to CI. Previous studies analyzed only 2 -D images, not based on measurements of the whole volume and cannot be used for determining the changes in the 3 -D microstructure. To this end, X-ray microtomography (μCT) protocols and image processing tools were developed to characterize the microstructure of mango. The protocols and tools were applied to obtain 3 -D images of mango tissues at different stages during ripening of the fruit, and via 3 -D image processing and multivariate statistics to investigate the changes in 3 -D microstructure of a healthy fruit. This provided the basis for comparing the 3 -D microstructural changes in the fruit during CI. 3 -D analysis of structural parameters revealed changes in microstructure along the radial axis of the fruit and clear changes in the microstructure during ripening. Multivariate statistical analysis unveiled that ripening was associated with a decrease in pore size, and increase in pore fragmentation and pore specific surface area. An integrated understanding on the effect of these microstructural changes in the postharvest ripening of the fruit was presented by investigating the observed microstructural changes in relation to the evolution of quality during ripening. This was accomplished by monitoring the changes in 3 -D microstructure at different stages of ripening and observing the concurrent changes in quality. Quality changes are known to be influenced by the postharvest metabolism, which is directly affected by the changes in microstructure. The changes in quality indices such as firmness, color, taste and aroma greatly affect price competitiveness and consumer acceptability, which are essential to the marketability of the fruit. Microstructural changes associated with cell leakage were supported by the increase in the electrolyte leakage measurement of the peel. In addition, possible effects of microstructure on respiration, color development, firmness and flavor development were identified. Multivariate statistics identified structural parameters, aroma volatiles and other quality parameters that are important to ripening. Next, we investigated the 3 -D microstructural changes during CI. This was accomplished through the use of X-ray μCT of tissue obtained at different stages during cold storage, three-dimensional image processing and multivariate statistics in relation to changes in CI indicators. Microstructural changes observed during CI included a decrease in porosity, pore size and pore connectivity due to cell leakage and tissue breakdown, which was followed by an increase in pore size due to cavity formation. These changes contribute significantly to CI by drastically changing tissue aeration and water movement. Multivariate statistics identified pore connectivity and Euler number as the most important parameters in relation to CI. These changes were found to adversely affect the quality resulting in the expression of CI symptoms, increase of electrolyte leakage, limited respiration, less color development, impaired citric acid metabolism and aroma volatile production. Multivariate statistics identified structural parameters, aroma volatiles and other quality parameters that are important to CI. In conclusion, the study showed the feasibility of using μCT to characterize the microstructure of mango fruit. Automatic segmentation and analysis allowed quantification of individual cells and tissue breakdown due to CI. Microstructure analysis allowed identification of the role of intracellular water leakage in tissue breakdown, cavity formation and peel and lenticel discoloration. Microstructural changes during CI support the hypothesis that changes in tissue and pore structure in mango fruit contribute significantly to the development of postharvest tissue disorders by drastically affecting tissue aeration and water movement, identical to what has been observed in other fruit species. This study confirmed the effect of microstructure on aroma volatiles, due to its adverse effects on gas exchange properties, limiting the respiration and shifting the metabolism of the fruit. Multivariate statistics allowed identification of structural and quality parameters that are important to ripening and CI. It served as a tool to formulate a conceptual model to describe CI, revealing a complex and in-depth relation underlying the effect of CI on microstructure and quality.
