5|$|The {{folly of}} the First World War as {{a choice of}} policy; <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> costs of modern war, direct and indirect, predictably {{exceeded}} the benefits of eliminating the Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E
5000|$|The Republican Minority Leader, John Boehner (R-Ohio), {{opposed the}} {{legislation}} from its introduction. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DISCLOSE Act violated the First Amendment and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{bill is a}} scheme {{on the part of}} the majority to silence their opponents. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legislation had fallen victim to back-room deals and special interest exemptions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Steiner's {{early work}} {{focused on the}} {{phonology}} of Semitic languages, especially Hebrew. In one book <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letter known as Hebrew sin was pronounced as a fricative-lateral and in another <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pronunciation of the letter tsade as an affricate, /ts/, is very old and widespread, against others who had doubted this. [...] These books have convinced most specialists.|$|R

5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, Rezaei sent {{a letter}} to Ayatollah Khomeini in which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iran-Iraq War could not be won.|$|R
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Greg Retallack's {{hypothesis}} that Ediacaran organisms were lichens is not widely {{accepted by the}} scientific community. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish, and their relief is closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders. He points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction, and claims the large size of the organisms (up to 1.5 metres long, far larger {{than any of the}} preserved burrows) also hints against classification with animals. Finally, Ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols, interpreted as soils of well-drained temperate desert soils. Such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi, but other Ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies.|$|E
5|$|The trade {{connection}} from Cattigara extended, via ports on {{the coasts}} of India and Sri Lanka, {{all the way to}} Roman-controlled ports in Egypt and the Nabataean territories on the north-eastern coast of the Red Sea. The archaeologist Warwick Ball does not consider discoveries such as the Roman and Roman-inspired goods at Óc Eo, a coin of Roman emperor Maximian found in Tonkin, and a Roman bronze lamp at P'ong Tuk in the Mekong Delta, to be conclusive proof that Romans visited these areas and suggests that the items could have been introduced by Indian merchants. While observing that the Romans had a recognised trading port in Southeast Asia, Dougald O'Reilly writes that there is little evidence to suggest Cattigara was Óc Eo. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roman items found there only indicate that the Indian Ocean trade network extended to the ancient Kingdom of Funan.|$|E

5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> watchmaker's {{creation}} of the watch implies that the watchmaker must be {{more complex than the}} watch.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the basic}} set-up of his {{argument}} against the existence of God, the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit, where <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first attempt is self-refuting, and the second approach is the way forward.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animals {{listed as}} {{sacrificial}} victims {{are just as}} symbolic as the list of human victims listed in the Purushamedha. (which is generally accepted as a purely symbolic sacrifice already in Rigvedic times).|$|E
25|$|Philosophically, Craig uses two {{traditional}} {{arguments to}} show that time is finite: <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of an actual infinite is metaphysically impossible, and that forming an actual infinite through successive addition is metaphysically impossible.|$|E

25|$|Dante {{addresses}} the topic in his De Vulgari Eloquentia. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.

25|$|Duesberg {{argues that}} there is a {{statistical}} correlation between trends in recreational drug use and trends in AIDS cases. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> epidemic of AIDS cases in the 1980s corresponds to a supposed epidemic of recreational drug use in the United States and Europe during the same time frame.|$|E

50|$|Described as a liberal, B. F. Austin {{was always}} a very strong proponent of social change to {{alleviate}} {{the condition of the}} poor in society. In 1884 he published a sermon The Gospel of the Poor vs. Pew Rents, in which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ability of rich families to reserve specific pews created un-Christian divisions between congregants. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church should be a place for all people to gather, and reminded <b>the</b> Methodist authorities <b>that</b> Jesus of Nazareth had himself opposed the mal-treatment of the poor.|$|R
