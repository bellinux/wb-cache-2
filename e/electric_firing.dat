5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an <b>electric</b> <b>fire</b> engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled <b>electric</b> <b>fire</b> engine in 1899. The French <b>electric</b> <b>fire</b> engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an <b>electric</b> <b>fire</b> engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|R

The two RAAF, two RAF, and one RNZAF squadrons, during December 1941-January 1942, were beset with numerous problems, including poorly built and ill-equipped aircraft. Aviation historian Dan Ford characterized it as, [...] "The performance... was pathetic." [...] Inadequate spare parts and support staff, airfields that were difficult to defend against air attack, lack of a clear and coherent command structure, a Japanese spy in the Army air liaison staff, antagonism between RAF and RAAF squadrons and personnel, and inexperienced pilots lacking appropriate training would lead to disaster.

5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire Select Switch. It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the <b>electric</b> <b>firing</b> key on his right hand wheel. Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials tell him the difference between the gun's present elevation and the ordered elevation electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. He changes the elevation of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the elevation drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives elevation control to the Fire Control System. Then, he moves the Electrical Fire Select Switch to [...] "AUTO", and reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Elevation in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire Select Switch to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his hand wheels to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the firing key on his right hand wheel.|$|E

40|$|For any modern army {{it is very}} {{important}} to continuously maintain a high degree of operational (combat) readiness (availability) in order to maximize the effectiveness of the use of technical systems. Since determination and prediction of technical states and failures of technical systems in engineering, especially in armament, are difficult due to the impossibility of continuous condition monitoring with appropriate measuring equipment there is a need for a maintenance model that would be most helpful in taking timely action maintenance. In this paper, the subject of research is a model of maintenance of the M- 84 tank  weapoons systems.   IntroductionThe M- 84 tank is one of the most promising technical systems in the Serbian Army. Its use and modifications are foreseen in the next ten years. The  M- 84 is characterized by good tactical and technical characteristics. It has a powerful 125 mm cannon, coupled 7. 62 mm machine gun and 12. 7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun. The M- 84 tank has an automatic battery charger and a fire control system. The fire control system enables fast target tracking and stabilization of the cannon barrel, which is a prerequisite for timely and favorable effect on the target. There are certain ambiguities in the existing model of maintenance of tank weapons.   Technical diagnostics Technical diagnostics, as a part of the process of condition-based maintenance, should determine technical conditions of components or technical systems with certain accuracy at a point in time.   Maintenance strategy A maintenance strategy can be defined as a variant of a maintenance system determined by a concept, organization and character of maintenance procedures, as well as the relationship between the various levels at which maintenance is performed. It is defined for technical system parts, individual technical systems and for system maintenance as a whole. The basic maintenance strategies implemented today are: -      corrective maintenance, -      preventive maintenance, -      combined maintenance.   Some developed condition-based maintenance models Condition-based maintenance models can be classified in two groups as: -      models of technical change in the current situation (with a use of condition inspection), -      models of technical change in the situation (with a use of condition diagnostics).   Some developed condition-based maintenance models The  models of condition-based maintenance  include: -      condition-based maintenance model with parameters control, -      condition-based maintenance model with the control of reliability levels.   Condition-based maintenance model with parameters control Condition-based maintenance model with parameters control can be with: -      periodic diagnostic controls (“the constant date”), -      economic setting of the intervals of diagnostic controls, -      continous diagnostic controls.   Condition-based maintenance model with the reliability level control The essence of the condition-based maintenance model with the control of reliability levels is to use resources between two repairs without limitation, with execution of maintenance activities necessary to fix the failure occurred, while the actual reliability level is within the boundaries of the set (permissible) norms. If deviations from these norms occur,  the causes of deviations are analysed and measures taken to increase the reliability level of individual components and the system.   The possibilities of the application of the condition-based maintenance model on the example of tank weapons The application of the condition-based maintenance model with parameters control is hard to realize in tank weapons, except for a tank cannon barrel. In this case,  the intensity of the stress in the material on the critical barrel sections can be measured during operation, using electrical extensiometers. Voltage intensity can be used to determine the safety degree on the observed sections. Comparing the actual level of safety with the projected level, we can decide on the action of maintenance to be implemented in order to prevent failure. The data from Table 1 and the methodology for the selection of maintenance strategies (Figure 1), in the case of a weakened or damaged magnets for <b>electric</b> <b>firing</b> on the tank 7. 62 mm machine gun indicate the possibilities of the condition-based maintenance model with the control of reliability levels. Conclusion The introduction of the condition-based maintenance model would minimize overall costs because the “ reliability reserve ” of components or representative tank weapons would be used to the maximum. On the other hand, the current maintenance system of tank weapons would experience some changes. The intensity of preventive maintenance actions could be reduced and particular maintenance levels might be omitted  as well as specific types of maintenance (easy maintenance, medium maintenance).  </p...|$|E
