25|$|No recent {{evaluation}} of conservation status {{has been done}} by the IUCN. Additionally, considering the current confusion as to number of species, as well as the wide distribution, conservation status should be reconsidered. All strains are probably endangered, but some (notably the super red and red-tailed golden) more critically than others. The Asian arowana's high value as aquarium fish has impacted its conservation. Its popularity <b>has</b> <b>soared</b> since the late 1970s, and hobbyists may pay thousands of U.S. dollars for one of these animals. Certain color varieties are more endangered than others, since the red and gold varieties are both less common, and in higher demand in the aquarium trade.|$|E
25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000.

At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E

In 2002 production rose to nearly 3.25million and then jumped to 4.44million in 2003, 5.07million in 2004, 5.71million in 2005, 7.28million in 2006, 8.88million in 2007, 9.35million in 2008 and 13.83million in 2009.

And he and she seemed looking through that web at the colour and the deep-down forms enshrouded so jealously; each feared too much to unveil the other's heart. They were like lovers who, rambling in a shy wood, never dare stay their babbling talk of the trees and birds and lost bluebells, lest in the deep waters of a kiss their star of all that is to come should fall and be drowned. To each hour its familiar--and the spirit of that hour was the spirit of the white flowers in the bowl on the window-sill above her head.|$|E
60|$|By {{the common}} consent of all mankind who have read, poetry takes the highest place in literature. That nobility of expression, {{and all but}} divine grace of words, which she is bound to attain before she can make her footing good, is not {{compatible}} with prose. Indeed it is that which turns prose into poetry. When {{that has been in}} truth achieved, the reader knows that the writer <b>has</b> <b>soared</b> above the earth, and can teach his lessons somewhat as a god might teach. He who sits down to write his tale in prose makes no such attempt, nor does he dream that the poet's honour is within his reach;--but his teaching is of the same nature, and his lessons all tend to the same end. By either, false sentiments may be fostered; false notions of humanity may be engendered; false honour, false love, false worship may be created; by either, vice instead of virtue may be taught. But by each, equally, may true honour, true love; true worship, and true humanity be inculcated; {{and that will be the}} greatest teacher who will spread such truth the widest. But at present, much as novels, as novels, are bought and read, there exists still an idea, a feeling which is very prevalent, that novels at their best are but innocent. Young men and women,--and old men and women too,--read more of them than of poetry, because such reading is easier than the reading of poetry; but they read them,--as men eat pastry after dinner,--not without some inward conviction that the taste is vain if not vicious. I take upon myself to say that it is neither vicious nor vain.|$|E
