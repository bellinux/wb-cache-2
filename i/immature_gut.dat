40|$|Objective: Gut {{microbiota}} modulates adiposity and {{glucose metabolism}} in humans and mice. Here we investigated how colonization of germ-free (GF) mice affects kinetics of adiposity and glucose metabolism. Methods: Adiposity and glucose metabolism were evaluated at different time points in ex-GF and antibiotic treated mice after colonization with gut microbiota from a conventionally raised (CONV-R) mouse. Mouse physiology, microbiome configuration, serum cytokine levels, and gene expression for inflammatory markers were performed in different tissues. Results: Colonization {{resulted in a}} bi-phasic glucose impairment: the first phase occurring within 3 days of colonization (early phase) and the second 14 – 28 days after colonization (delayed phase). The early phase co-occurred with an inflammatory response and was independent of adiposity, while the delayed phase was mostly ascribed to adipose tissue expansion and inflammation. Importantly, re-colonization of antibiotic treated mice displays only the delayed phase of glucose impairment and adiposity, suggesting that the early phase may be unique to colonization of the <b>immature</b> GF mice <b>gut.</b> Conclusions: Our results provide new insights on host–microbiota interaction during colonization of GF mice and the resulting effects on adiposity and glucose metabolism in a time resolved fashion...|$|R
40|$|At birth, {{the immune}} system is <b>immature</b> and the <b>gut</b> {{microbiota}} influences immune maturation. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and lactobacilli {{are part of the}} neonatal gut microbiota and have seemingly opposite effects on {{the immune system}}. S. aureus is a potent immune activator and early-life colonization associates with higher immune responsiveness later in life. Lactobacilli-colonization associates with reduced allergy-risk and lower immune responsiveness. Further, lactobacilli modulate immune-activation and have probiotic features. Here, we investigated S. aureus-induced activation of human lymphocytes, including T regulatory cells (Tregs), conventional T-cells (CD 4 + and CD 8 +), unconventional T-cells (γδ T-cells and MAIT-cells) and NK-cells from children and adults, together with the modulatory effect of lactobacilli on immune-activation. Further, early-life colonization with these bacteria was related to lymphocyte-maturation, plasma cytokine- and chemokine-levels and allergy.   S. aureus cell free supernatant (CFS) and staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A induced an increased percentage of FOXP 3 + Tregs and of CD 161 +, IL- 10 +, IFN-γ+ and IL- 17 A+ Tregs (Paper I). The same pattern was observed in children with a lower degree of activation, possibly due to lower CD 161 -expression and poor activation of naive T-cells (Paper II). S. aureus-CFS induced IFN-γ-expression, proliferation and cytotoxic capacity in conventional and unconventional T-cells, and NK-cells. SEA, but not SEH, induced activation of unconventional T-cells and NK-cells by unknown mechanism(s) (Paper III, extended data). Lactobacilli-CFS reduced S. aureus-induced lymphocyte activation without the involvement of IL- 10, Tregs or monocytes, but possibly involving lactate (Paper III). Early-life colonization with S. aureus associated with increased percentages of CD 161 + and IL- 10 + Tregs while lactobacilli-colonization negatively correlated with the percentage of IL- 10 + Tregs later in life (Paper II). Allergic disease in childhood associated with double allergic heredity, being born wintertime and with higher plasma levels of TH 2 -, TH 17 - and TFH-related chemokines early in life. Lactobacilli-colonization associated with lower prevalence of allergy, reduced chemokine-levels and increased levels of IFN-γ in plasma (Paper IV).     This thesis provides novel insights into S. aureus- and SE-mediated activation of Tregs, unconventional T-cells and NK-cells and suggests an overall impairment of immune-responsiveness towards this bacterium in children. Further, S. aureus-colonization may influence the maturation of peripheral Tregs. Our data show that lactobacilli potently dampen lymphocyte-activation in vitro and that colonization associates with Treg-responsiveness, altered plasma cytokine- and chemokine-levels and with remaining non-allergic, thereby supporting the idea of lactobacilli as important immune-modulators.

40|$|Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality, affecting primarily preterm neonates. The pathogenesis of this intestinal disease appears to be linked to the disruption or delay of bacterial colonization, termed gut dysbiosis. Intestinal immaturity, antibiotic use and hospital microbial environment are the main triggers of this pathological process. Conversely, gut symbiosis is made possible by the presence of beneficial and commensal bacterial species that protect the <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> from opportunistic pathogens overgrowth and inflammation. Herein, we review the relationships between gut microbiota and NEC in preterm neonates. We also discuss the role of specific microorganisms belonging to the commensal microbiota, highlighting the possibility for a toxigenic mechanism involved in NEC pathogenesis.

Childhood exposure starts with exposure in the womb, as fetal blood lead levels are very close to maternal levels. Exposure to maternal lead will reduce with breast-feeding as little lead is transmitted in breast milk, but this is offset by a higher rate of absorption in the <b>immature</b> <b>gut.</b> The hand-to-mouth behavior of young children can also lead to oral exposure to lead-bearing objects.

40|$|Adhesion of gut {{bacteria}} to the intestinal epithelium {{is the first}} step in their colonization of the neonatal <b>immature</b> <b>gut.</b> Bacterial colonization of the infant gut is influenced by several factors, of which the most important are the mode of delivery and breast-feeding. Breast-fed infants ingest several grams of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) per day, which can become receptor decoys for intestinal bacteria. The most abundant intestinal bacteria in vaginally delivered infants are bifidobacteria, whereas infants born by cesarean section are colonized by clostridia. The influence of HMOs on the adhesion of five strains of intestinal bacteria (three bifidobacterial strains and two clostridial strains) to mucus-secreting and non-mucus-secreting human epithelial cells was investigated. Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 and Bifidobacterium longum displayed almost the same level of adhesion in the presence and absence of HMOs. By contrast, adhesion of Clostridium butyricum 1 and 2 decreased from 14. 41 % to 6. 72 % and from 41. 54 % to 30. 91 %, respectively, in the presence of HMOs. The results of this study indicate that HMOs affect bacterial adhesion and are an important factor influencing bacterial colonization of the gut.

Evidence suggests that the interaction of immature human enterocytes with bacteria and their enterotoxins may account for the increased susceptibility of neonates to diarrheal diseases. However, the precise mechanisms that contribute to the excessive response to cholera toxin by the <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> are largely unknown. Our aim was to characterize the cellular/molecular changes in Gs(alpha) during gut development. In this study, a colonic human epithelial cell line (T 84) was used as representative of a mature enterocyte and a human fetal primary small intestinal cell line (H 4) as representative of an immature enterocyte. Using our cell culture model of human intestinal development, we provide consistent evidence that cholera toxin (CT) -mediated Gs(alpha) activation in fetal enterocytes differs from that of mature enterocytes, and the difference may be related to ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) interaction with the CT-signaling process. Here we demonstrated that ARF 1 may {{play a critical role in}} clathrin-mediated CT trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and that ARF 6 may facilitate clathrin-mediated CT endocytosis that leads to enhanced Gs(alpha) activation by CT. Collectively, these findings support our hypothesis that there is a developmentally regulated intestinal cellular response to bacterial exotoxins involving complex cellular events that accounts for the increased incidence and severity of toxogenic diarrhea during infancy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Development of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and immune {{system can be}} modulated by the gut microbiota. Establishment of the intestinal microbiota, in its turn, is affected by host and environmental factors. As such, development of the gut microbiota is greatly impacted in preterm infants, who have an <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> and are exposed to factors like hospitalization, caesarean section, antibiotics, and respiratory support. Design: We analyzed fecal microbiota composition and activity of ten preterm infants (gestational age 25 - 30 weeks; birthweight 630 - 1750 g) {{during the first six}} postnatal weeks through metaproteomics (LC-MS/MS) and 16 S-rRNA gene sequencing. Results: A gestational-age-dependent microbial signature is observed, enabling microbiota-based differentiation between extremely preterm (25 - 27 weeks gestation) and very preterm (30 weeks gestation) infants. In very preterm infants, the intestinal microbiota developed toward a Bifidobacterium-dominated community and was associated with high abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Extremely preterm infants remained predominantly colonized by facultative anaerobes and were associated with proteins involved in membrane transport and translation. Delayed colonization by obligate anaerobes could be associated with antibiotic treatment and respiratory support. Conclusion: We speculate that gestational age and its associated intensity of care (e. g. antibiotics and respiratory support) affects intestinal microbiota composition and activity in preterm infants.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Immature</b> <b>gut</b> {{immunity}} {{can be a}} {{predisposing factor}} for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The gut active immunity and innate defense to the Escherichia coli endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in immature and mature rats were studied. Methods: LPS, started at a dose of 10 mg/kg, was instilled into the stomachs of fetal, newborn, 1 -month and 3 -monthold rats. Boost doses and normal saline control instillations were given on day 14. Rats that died after instillation had detailed postmortem examinations. For survivors, a group of 6 immunized and 6 controls were killed on day 7 for the collection of serum, spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and small intestines. Lymphocytes (106) prepared from each tissue sample of individual group were cultured for 5 days. Serum and supernatant were analyzed for IgA and anti-E coli IgA levels. Results: All control rats survived. The doses of LPS given were 10, 5, 2. 5, and 1. 25 mg/kg. All fetal rats died after LPS instillation. Half-lethal dose for newborns was 2. 5 mg/kg. One-month and 3 -month-old rats survived all doses of LPS. The {{cause of death was}} endotoxemia. The serum IgA and total supernatant anti- E coli IgA levels of rats of all ages studied showed no significant difference. Conclusion: The poor innate gut defense, not so much the active immunity, may provide an explanation for the susceptibility of the premature babies and newborn infants to the development of NEC.

40|$|Enteral {{exposure}} of suckling rats to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) {{has been shown}} to induce growth and precocious functional maturation of the gastrointestinal tract. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the mechanism of this action. Suckling rats, 14 d old, were fed a single dose of PHA (0. 05 mg/g body weight) or saline. The binding of PHA to the gut epithelium and its effect on the morphology and functional properties of the gut and pancreas were studied up to 3 d after treatment. Initially, at 1 - 24 h, the PHA bound along the gut mucosal lining, resulting in disturbed gut morphology with villi shortening and rapid decreases in disaccharidase activities and macromolecular absorption capacity. During a later phase, between 1 and 3 d, the PHA binding had declined, and an uptake by enterocytes was observed. An increase in crypt cell proliferation and gut growth became evident during this period, together with a functional maturation, as indicated by increases in disaccharidase (maltase and sucrase) activities and the low macromolecular absorption capacity. Pancreas growth also increased, as did its content of digestive enzymes. We conclude that enteral exposure to PHA in suckling rats temporarily causes mucosal disarrangement and functional impediment of the gut, which may be explained by binding to and disruption of the gut mucosa and a two-fold increase in the plasma corticosterone concentration. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of diet in gastrointestinal maturation and may constitute a basis for the treatment of mammals having an <b>immature</b> <b>gut...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Immature</b> <b>gut</b> {{motility}} in {{very low}} birth weight infants causes feeding intolerance. We evaluated the effect of domperidone, a prokinetic agent, on gastric emptying in very {{low birth weight}} infants. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} a crossover design. Gastric emptying was assessed ultrasonographically by measuring the time it took the antral cross sectional area of the stomach to reach half {{of the value of the}} 1 st measurement on 2 occasions: (1) upon administration of domperidone (0. 3 mg/kg/ 8 h p. o.) for at least 2 days and (2) while patients received an equal quantity of sterile water. 11 infants were randomly assigned to receive domperidone before the 1 st measurement and the remaining afterwards. There was a 3 - 5 day interval between the 2 measurements. At the time when both measurements were performed, every neonate had been receiving the same quantity and quality of milk. 12 infants were formula-fed while 10 were fed their own mother's supplemented milk. Results: 22 infants with a mean (SD) birth weight of 1, 377 g (319) and a mean (SD) gestational age of 30. 2 weeks (2. 1) were studied. The mean (SD) antral cross sectional area half-value time (in minutes) was 47. 6 (23. 9) in the domperidone group and 68. 2 (25. 5) in the control group (p = 0. 008). There was no significant difference between formula-fed neonates and neonates fed their own mother's milk in either group. Conclusions: Domperidone significantly reduces gastric emptying in preterm neonates, and this may account for its effect in cases of disturbances related to gut motility. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

40|$|Next {{generation}} sequencing {{techniques are}} currently revealing novel {{insight into the}} microbiome of the human gut. This new area of research seems especially relevant for neonatal diseases, because {{the development of the}} intestinal microbiome already starts in the perinatal period and preterm infants with a still <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> associated immune system may be harmed by a dysproportional microbial colonization. For most gastrointestinal diseases requiring paediatric surgery there is very limited information {{about the role of the}} intestinal microbiome. This reviews aims to summarize the current knowledge and outline future perspectives for important pathologies like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of the newborn, short bowel syndrome (SBS) and Hirschsprung´s disease associated enterocolitis (HAEC). Only studies applying next generation sequencing techniques to analyse the diversity of the intestinal microbiome were included. In NEC patients intestinal dysbiosis could already be detected prior to any clinical evidence of the disease resulting in a reduction of the bacterial diversity. In SBS patients the diversity seems to be reduced compared to controls. In children with Hirschsprung´s disease the intestinal microbiome differs between those with and without episodes of enterocolitis. One common finding for all three diseases seems to be an overabundance of Proteobacteria. However, most human studies are based on fecal samples and experimental data question whether fecal samples actually represent the microbiome at the site of the diseased bowel and whether the luminal (transient) microbiome compares to the mucosal (resident) microbiome. In conclusion current studies already allow a preliminary understanding of the potential role of the intestinal microbiome in pediatric surgical diseases. Future investigations could clarify the interface between the intestinal epithelium, its immunological competence and mucosal microbiome. Advances in this field may have an impact on the understanding and non-operative treatment of such diseases in infancy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Immaturity {{remains the}} main {{risk factor for}} necrotising {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) – the most devastating intestinal emergency in immature infants. We aimed to reach {{a better understanding of}} the nature of intestinal immaturity. Methods: We used a previously published NEC model where intestinal injury was induced in dam-fed newborn rats and in weanling rats by hypercapnia/reoxygenation (H/R). Injury was diagnosed as a gut barrier failure (increased permeability for dextran). Expression of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and caspase 3 was measured (quantitative PCR; immuno blot) to further characterise the stress response. The activity of caspase 3 was measured colorimetrically. Results: In weanling rats, H/R induced the expression of intestinal HO- 1. Neither gut barrier failure nor apoptosis nor increased iNOS expression occurred. In contrast, <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> exhibited gut barrier failure, apoptosis, and an increased iNOS expression upon H/R, with the expression of HO- 1 peaking around 24 hours later than in weanling rats. This was accompanied by apoptosis (activation of caspase 3), an increased iNOS expression and gut barrier failure. We induced HO- 1 with hemin. Gut barrier failure and apoptosis were thus abrogated. Vice versa, the inhibition of HO- 1 by SnPP (tin protoporphyrin) led to gut barrier failure without H/R. Conclusion: For the first time, we showed in a clinically relevant model of enterocolitis without infectious or nutritional influences that gut barrier failure occurs in response to a delayed expression of HO- 1 in newborn rats. The late increase in the expression of protective HO- 1 could, at least in part, explain the high susceptibility of immature infants to NEC on a molecular basis. An induction of HO- 1 abrogates injury in the H/R model. The induction of HO- 1 by hemin or a controlled therapy with exogenous CO could present new strategies in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids (GC) {{contribute}} to human intestine ontogeny and accelerate gut barrier development in preparation to birth. Rat gut is immature at birth, and high intestinal GC sensitivity {{during the first}} two weeks of life resembles that of premature infants. This makes suckling rats a model to investigate postpartum impact of maternal separation (MS) -associated GC release in preterm babies, and whether GC sensitivity may shape MS effects in <b>immature</b> <b>gut.</b> A 4 hours-MS applied once at postnatal day (PND) 10 enhanced plasma corticosterone in male and female pups, increased by two times the total in vivo intestinal permeability (IP) to oral FITC-Dextran 4 kDa (FD 4) immediately after the end of MS, and induced bacterial translocation (BT) to liver and spleen. Ussing chamber experiments demonstrated a 2 -fold increase of permeability to FD 4 in the colon immediately after the end of MS, but not in the ileum. Colonic permeability was not only increased for FD 4 but also to intact horseradish peroxidase 44 kDa in MS pups. In vivo, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU 486 or ML 7 blockade of myosin light chain kinase controlling epithelial cytoskeleton contraction prevented MS-induced IP increase to oral FD 4 and BT. In addition, the GR agonist dexamethasone dose-dependently mimicked MS-increase of IP to oral FD 4. In contrast, MS effects on IP to oral FD 4 and BT were absent at PND 20, a model for full-term infant, characterized by a marked drop of IP to FD 4 in response to dexamethasone, and decreased GR expression in the colon only compared to PND 10 pups.

40|$|Late-onset sepsis (LOS) {{affects a}} large {{proportion}} of pre-term neonates in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) worldwide, with high morbidity and related mortality, and frequent occurrence of severe late neurodevelopmental impairment. Due to the frequency, severity and difficulties in early diagnosis and prompt therapy, prevention is crucial for decreasing the burden of infection-related complications in NICUs. It is well known that feeding with fresh maternal milk, hygiene measures and the cautious use of H 2 -blockers are related with a decreased risk of developing sepsis. However, evidence from randomised clinical trials exists only for fluconazole in the prevention of fungal infections in the NICU. Lactoferrin is the main whey protein in mammalian milk, and is involved in innate immune host defences. Notably, human lactoferrin can be found at increased concentrations in colostrum and in milk from mothers of premature neonates. Human (hLF) and bovine lactoferrin (bLF) share a high (77 %) amino-acid homology, and the same N-terminal peptide responsible for antimicrobial activity, called lactoferricin. In vitro, bLF shows potent direct antimicrobial activity against all types of pathogens, which occurs via anti-cell wall actions and leads to disintegration of the micro-organism's membranes. bLF is also synergistic with many antimicrobials and antifungals, and promotes growth and differentiation of the <b>immature</b> <b>gut.</b> Based on this background data, a randomised clinical trial was recently conducted in very low birth weight pre-term neonates given bLF alone or with the probiotic Lactobacillus GG.

40|$|Lactation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} innovations that make mammals different from the other vertebrates. During lactation the female mammal feeds her newborn young with milk - a highly nutritious secretion of the mammary glands unique to mammals. Lactation allows mammals flexibility in where and when they reproduce, as well as the types of resources that can support them. The resources used during lactation can come from body stores before being converted to milk. So lactation allows mammals to harvest scarce resources over a long period, then feed the young at a suitable place and time (Pond 1984). This is especially important in large mammals where the developmental time is much longer than the seasons of plentiful resources, such as the arctic summer. Ice-breeding seals store resources harvested over months or years, then transfer them in milk to their babies in as little as four days. Bears use stored resources to lactate during their winter dormancy when they cannot be active and feeding. Lactation also allows the larger, more experienced mother to feed young that could not survive on an adult diet because they are too small, inexperienced or have an <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> without symbiotic bacteria. This is especially important in herbivores that need to develop the gut before being able to survive on an adult diet, or others where the young need to learn how to hunt or forage. So lactation is important because it allows mammals to invest in their young well after birth and up to a much larger size than could possibly be born. It allows the mother to convert a poor or variable environmental resource into a rich input to her offspring, allowing her to sUppOli her offspring through the difficult process of developing the ability to survive on an adult diet, learning to forage or catch prey and developing the digestive system (Pond 1984) ...|$|E
40|$|Hypoallergenic cow’s milk (HA) {{formulas}} play {{an important}} role in the prevention of cow’s milk allergy in high risk children as well as in treatment strategies. This thesis describes the development of a murine model for cow’s milk allergy to analyze the residual allergenicity and sensitizing capacities of cow’s milk protein hydrolysates, as present in HA infant formulas. Safety testing of new HA infant formulas in animal models is indispensable to confirm the absence of allergenic peptides in the HA infant formulas. Prevention of cow’s milk allergy with hydrolysed proteins is mainly based on avoidance of the allergen but can also be a result of oral tolerance induction. Therefore, the potency of these hydrolysates to induce oral tolerance and the mechanisms behind these protective effects were topic of investigation described in this thesis. In newborns the mucosal barrier is still immature for optimal absorption of nutrients provided by breastfeeding. The immature status of the immune system combined with a “leaky” <b>immature</b> <b>gut</b> is considered a risk factor to develop immune reactivity to food antigens when introduced too early in life. On the other hand, antigens provided via the oral route are important for the maturation and training of the mucosal immune system. Hence, a delicate balance occurs between avoidance of proteins to prevent early sensitization and the need for proteins to develop oral tolerance. In this thesis we positioned the whey based mouse model for cow’s milk allergy, as a new in vivo model, for safety testing of HA infant formulas. We started to validate the mouse model in a ring trial with four independent research facilities. Using this model, the studies described in this thesis have shown that a partial WH with limited sensitizing capacities was capable to induce oral tolerance to whey proteins in mice and that this protective effect can be enhanced using non-digestible oligosaccharides. Most likely CD 11 c+CD 103 + and Foxp 3 + regulatory T-cells contribute to these protective effects. The partial WH induced protection could be adoptively transferred using MLN cells of tolerized mice when provided to naﶥ recipient mice prior to whey sensitization. This indicates the importance of MLN in the transfer of local to systemic tolerance. It was observed that sensitization with cow’s milk proteins can result in IgLC-dependent acute allergic and intestinal hypersensitivity responses indicating that IgLC is a promising new biomarker for food allergy. Besides its role in the induction of cow’s milk allergy it was demonstrated that IgLC might contribute in the oral tolerance induction to whey proteins as wel...|$|E
40|$|Ongulates {{are born}} agammaglobulinaemic; their {{survival}} {{depends on the}} passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins (IgG 1) by colostrum ingestion. Currently, there is still 10 to 12 % of neonatal mortality, half is a the consequence of the failure in IgG 1 absorption through the <b>immature</b> <b>gut.</b> During the 24 first hours the gut is able to transfer a wide proportion of native IgG 1 by micropinocytosis. This transport should be enhanced by molecules present in the aqueous phase of the colostrum (serocolostrum). Hence, four serocolostrums, were produced by membrane fractionation with modification in soluble molecules composition except for IgG 1 concentration. They were expected to contain factors enhancer of the IgG 1 intestinal absorption {{in order to be}} used as a colostrum replacer for foals and calves. Two serocolostrums were freeze-dried to be used in addition to whole and skimmed milk (foals and calves) or to IgG 1 deficient equine colostrum (DEC, foals). Animals were fed in the 7 first hours after birth with 4. 1 g of IgG 1 /kg body weight. Control groups received equine (foals) or bovine (calves) colostrum by tube feeding. Serum samples were taken versus time and serum concentration in equine and bovine IgG 1 was measured by single radial immunodiffusion. The half life and the absorption coefficient (AC) of the IgG 1 were calculated. The maximal IgG 1 concentration in animals’ serum was systematically at 18 hours after feeding. Regardless the composition of the serocolostrums, when given as a substitute, it was observed exactly the same failure in IgG 1 absorption with an IgG 1 serum concentration 2. 4 times (~ 8 gkg- 1, AC = 16 ± 5 %) and 3. 5 times (~ 5 gkg- 1, AC = 25 ± 7 %) lower in calves and foals respectively, when compared to the control groups. When serocolostrum was mixed with whole or skimmed bovine milk, IgG 1 serum concentration was only increased by ~ 1. 5 - 1. 8 for both species. When It was mixed to the DEC, the bovine IgG 1 concentration in foal serum was increased by 3 ([IgG 1] ~ 15 gkg- 1 (AC = 45 ± 5 %). Hence, it seems that molecular fractions (caseins and/or fat) present in colostrum but lacking in serocolostrum are involved in IgG absorption either by transfer activation or by avoiding a transfer limitation. Additional experiments are ongoing to test this assumption. The identification of these factors should permit to better understand the cellular mechanism of absorption in immature enterocytes. Our results also showed that bovine serocolostrum was efficient enough to compensate the failure in passive immunization in calves and foals even if the half time of bovine IgG 1 is reduced in foals...|$|E
