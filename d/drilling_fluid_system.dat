In this study, the effect of barite particle size on the IPL <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>system</b> settling behavior was investigated using five particle sizes namely- 32, 32 - 45, 45 - 75, + 75 µm and the unsieved barite. Stokes ’ law of separation theory was employed in the analysis. It was found that smaller barite particle sizes (< 75 µm) enhances the settling resistance. An ideal barite particle size of- 32 µm was chosen and used in the subsequent formulations to obtain optimum rheological properties by varying the amount of viscosifier used at 4. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 g marked as sample (a), (b) and (c). These samples were analysed for their rheology by using the conventional Fann viscometer calibrated using Bingham model.

On the basis of the water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> formulated in laboratory, this paper mainly describes the influences of different types and concentration of clay, the content of a colloid stabilizer named GHJ- 1 and fluid density on the rheological parameters such as viscosity and shear stress.

Clay content and proportions for different densities of brine-based fluids were recommended to effectively regulate the rheological properties.

40|$|Abstract. CCSD-SK 1 {{well was}} the first Cretaceous {{scientific}} drilling well in the world, locating in Songliao basin, Northeast China.

This paper introduced the anti-collapse <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> technology in main well where the desired continuous coring section was from 164. 77 m to 1792. 00 m. Continuous technical barriers challenged the intelligence of drilling engineers of this project. First, preserving the wellbore stability was the most critical aspect of continuous core drilling. From top to bottom, the unconsolidated sandstone in the Quaternary super stratum, the water sensitive shale in the Sifangtai group and upper stratum of the Nenjiang group, and the brittle shale of under stratum of the Nenjiang group increased the difficulty of anti-collapse <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> technology. Water invasion into the shale formation often weakens the wellbore and causes problems such as wellbore collapse, shale destabilization and stuck pipe. Fluids should be designed to mitigate these shale problems. Secondly, the openhole strategy imposed the difficulty of maintaining wellbore stability in the second open process (from 245. 00 m to the bottom). Finally, the total expense of the well was only one fifth of south well, which was drilled by an oilfield drilling contractor. To overcome these technical challenges, not only different <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> such as PAM <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> DFD-LG-CMC <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> and DFD-NH 4 HPAN-SAKH <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> were adopted separately, but also technology of feasible viscosity and managed pressure drilling were used.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate whether addition of nanoparticles to the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> could improve rheological, lubricating, viscoelastic and filtrate loss properties. The rheological properties were measured using av Fanning-VG viscometer. The lubricating properties of the fluid were determined through friction coefficient measurements using a CSM DIN 50324 Tribometer at varying temperatures, while filtrate loss was measured using standard API filtrate loss test setup. The tested nanoparticle additives were MoS 2, Graphene, TiO 2 and TiN. The results show that nanoparticle additives to the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> can improve the rheological properties. Addition of 0. 1 g MoS 2 per 500 ml at ambient temperature, improved the Bingham Yield Strength (YS) of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> by 183 % relative to the reference fluid. Similar experiments with higher concentration in the range of 0. 2 g to 0. 4 g per 500 mL, showed that increasing the nanoparticle concentration leads to a reduction in Bingham YS at ambient temperature. The same added concentrations showed that Graphene, TiO 2 and TiN did not {{have a significant impact on}} the fluid rheological properties. Nanoparticle composition and size may therefore impact the potential for drilling property improvement. In terms of lubricating properties, the experiments show that nanoparticles can improve the lubricity of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> by reducing the friction coefficient.

A vessel design able to perform <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore is developed and principal particulars for the vessel is presented. Economic benefits of introducing such vessel design, and current rules and regulations for reuse and recycling of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids,</b> are not discussed in this thesis. In this thesis a vessel concept develops by using the system based ship design methodology. <b>Drilling</b> operations, <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance, and platform supply vessels used to assist drilling operations as dedicated storage vessels, are analyzed to investigate the potential of implementing a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance vessel. Based on these analyses a concept design emerges. To aid in the development process of designing a vessel, a three-dimensional model and general arrangement drawings are created to visualize and validate the vessel design. An outline specification of the vessel is presented as a solution to the objective of performing <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore. This thesis proposes a vessel design able to perform <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore. Contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> used in a drilling operation, is treated onboard the vessel by a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance <b>system.</b> The <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance <b>system</b> consists of; three solids control units and one centrifuge to clean the contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> one mud-mixer to mix additives into the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> and storage tanks to store the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> and components. These systems are connected to a pump and piping system to move the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> around in the vessel. Total installed machinery in the vessel is 8700 kW. This power is distributed on three main generators of 2600 kW, one auxiliary generator of 700 kW, and one emergency generator of 200 kW. The main propulsion system consists of two azipull thrusters. In addition, there are two tunnel thrusters and one retractable azimuth thruster in the bow. Accommodation capacity for the vessel is 25 persons distributed on 19 cabins, where 13 of them are single cabins intended for the crew and 12 double cabins intended for clients. The vessel length over all is 91, 5 meters and the breadth is 20, 5 meters. Total displacement for the vessel is 9670 tonnes and the deadweight tonnage is 6295 tonnes. Total <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> tank capacity is 1612 m 3 and a total of 1690 m 3 water ballast tanks are placed in the hull to adjust vessel trim and heeling when loaded. The vessel design complies with the International Maritime Organization requirements for intact stability for the loading conditions presented. However, more loading conditions should be tested to ensure that the vessel is sufficiently safe. Large uncertainties regarding the quality of the contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> makes it difficult to determine the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance <b>system</b> and is therefore not identified in this thesis. Methods based on simulation could be utilized to address these issues in further development of the concept. However, experience from a similar concept, Safe Scandinavia, shows that <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance performed offshore, significantly reduce transport of contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> to shore for maintenance. Similar results may therefore apply for this vessel design, but should be further analyzed. The vessel design presented is similar to a large platform supply vessel and designed to operate on a fourteen-days long roundtrip. This is due to directions given by Statoil Marine early in the design process. This reduce the overall design space early in the design process. Exploration of the entire design space could drastically change the design and ought to be done to not exclude better designs. To verify the financial feasibility of the vessel concept, an assessment of building cost, operating cost, required freight rate, and profitability should be done. This could be used to guide the design towards better solutions. The vessel design presented can however be used as a template or reference vessel for further development of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance vessel concept...|$|R

For instances heavy crude oil have become increasingly important sources of hydrocarbons in many {{part of the world}} which transportation of these heavy crude to the refinery can be a problem, and the formation of crude oil emulsion due to high paraffinic compound existed in the crude causes problem in dewatering stage of the crude emulsion. Production of stable emulsion at high temperature and pressure has lead to the design of many new fracturing <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> and new <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>systems.</b> The inversion of the type emulsion at higher concentrations of dispersed phase has been utilized as a helpful process for transporting crude oil for long distances through pipeline. Therefore, a knowledge of the rheological behaviour of these emulsions, under both laboratory and field conditions, is important to choose the right approach in designing the required facilities. In order to get better understanding the effect of various influencing parameters on rheological properties of crude oil emulsion, the synthetic crude oil emulsion prepared by using crude oil sample and Triton X- 100 was studied at various temperature and water concentration. Brookfield Digital Rheometer was used to measure the rheology of the emulsion. The results showed that at low water concentration the emulsion behaves as a Newtonian fluid, however, at high water concentration it behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid. It was also observed that the viscosity decreases with temperature and the highest velocity was observed at the point close to phase invasion...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> {{properties}} is {{an essential}} part of cost effective drilling operations and process safety. Currently fluid properties are measured and optimized manually by human engineers with different skills and experience which might lead to nonoptimum <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties that deteriorate its functionalities. Automated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> management is still at an early development stage. Several vendors are actively developing automated skids to measure <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties in real time [1] [2], and several authors also have published scientific work on the use of the real-time measurement as a component of automated control systems that dose mud additives automatically to meet the mud specifications or setpoints defined by human engineers [3] [4]. During the well planning stage, the design process of mud specifications is carried out by engineers checking several scenarios using well planning software and their experience to come up with <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> specifications. When hole cleaning and/or borehole stability conditions change during the actual drilling process that warrant updates or changes of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties, the specifications are updated in an ad-hoc manner, relying on the skills of human engineers. This thesis focusses on the development of a model-based optimization module for <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties to help engineers in the planning and drilling phase to automatically derive <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> specifications that meet the hole cleaning criteria, and satisfy the downhole pressure requirement and constraints set on the operating ranges of drilling parameters. The optimization framework will use proxy models derived from well hydraulics software that predicts cuttings concentration and downhole pressure as a function of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties. Three objective functions for the optimization module are given as examples in this thesis. The first two objective functions deal with the hole cleaning criteria while the last one is a cost function that combines the cost of hole cleaning and downhole pressure management. The optimization module has been tested on a case study based on real field data. Given an objective function, multiple constraints, and proxy models, the module takes only a few seconds to find the optimum mud property values and drilling parameters such as flow rates, rotary speed and rate of penetration. A benchmark with the field data shows that the optimum <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> properties and parameters result in significant improvement of the hole cleaning state while the downhole pressure requirement and constraints on the drilling parameters can still be satisfied. When a cost function is defined as a combination of hole cleaning and downhole pressure management, the module also gives a quantified benefit of the trade-off between maximizing hole cleaning and minimizing losses. Since this module can perform optimization very efficiently compared to the ad-hoc processes done by human engineers, this module may be of significant value for operating units to use in the planning and drilling phase and also in the future as an outer optimization loop for automatic <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> control <b>systems.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesGeoscience & EngineeringPetroleum Engineerin...|$|R
