30|$|In {{order to}} speed up {{disaster}} relief operations, large obstacles can be surmounted instead of clearing them. Using crawler wheels, <b>power</b> <b>shovels</b> {{have the ability to}} go over objects effectively compared to other vehicles. However, there exists several challenges to obstacle surmounting with <b>power</b> <b>shovels</b> as follows: only the obstacles that are within the climbing limit of the crawler can be overcome; crawler power can be easily saturated; <b>power</b> <b>shovel</b> can tip over and damage itself if not moved skillfully when it is on top of an obstacle; being heavy machines, <b>power</b> <b>shovels</b> are also difficult {{to get back to the}} original state at the event of tip over.|$|R

30|$|<b>Power</b> <b>shovels</b> {{serve as}} {{essential}} machinery to remove wreckage and help accessing inner parts of disaster stricken areas. However, instead of removing obstacles, {{they can be}} surmounted to save time. In this work, an arm maneuver based method is proposed to surmount step-like obstacles for unmanned <b>power</b> <b>shovels.</b> A smooth trajectory was formulated to minimize jerk caused by the <b>power</b> <b>shovel</b> motion. Using SQP optimization technique the most energy efficient motion profile was identified, which was confirmed by exhaustive batch simulations. The proposed method was verified by conducting 3 D dynamic simulations and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. The authors {{believe that this is}} the first time a study has been conducted on unmanned <b>power</b> <b>shovel</b> for obstacle surmounting using arm maneuver mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The term shovel {{also applies}} to larger {{excavating}} machines called <b>power</b> <b>shovels,</b> which serve the same purpose—digging, lifting, and moving material.

30|$|Large debris created after natural {{disasters}} restrict access to inner parts of affected regions, and slows down disaster relief operations. <b>Power</b> <b>shovels</b> {{are often used}} to clear wreckage but the process can {{take a lot of}} time. Moreover, it is dangerous to involve human workers operating heavy machinery in such unstable conditions. To speedup access to inner areas, obstacles can be surmounted with the assistance of carefully maneuvered <b>power</b> <b>shovel</b> arm, instead of removing them. In this work, an autonomous obstacle surmounting technique for an unmanned <b>power</b> <b>shovel</b> is proposed. Out of different sequences, the one that optimizes the total energy consumption is chosen as the best candidate for surmounting a given step-like obstacle. Dynamic simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} <b>power</b> <b>control</b> {{as a solution}} to the multiple access problem in contention-based wireless ad-hoc networks. The motivation for this study is two fold, limiting multi-user interference to increase singlehop throughput, and reducing power consumption to increase battery life. We focus on next neighbor transmissions where nodes are required to send information packets to their respective receivers subject to a constraint on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple access problem is solved via two alternating phases, namely scheduling and <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> The scheduling algorithm is essential to coordinate the transmissions of independent users in order to eliminate strong interference (e. g. selfinterference) that can not be overcome by <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> is executed in a distributed fashion to determine the admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be used by the scheduled users to satisfy their single-hop transmission requirements. This is done for two types of networks, namely TDMA and TDMA/CDMA wireless ad-hoc networks. I...|$|R
