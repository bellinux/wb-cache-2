25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, {{the story of a}} Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E

A few days later, however, the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his family: [...] "When you have a season as a freshman like he did, the NBA, they like them young," [...] Trey's father, Benji Burke said.

This would be a travesty and a mistake. Slayer not only has something new to say on Repentless, but a new way to say it." [...] AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three out of five stars, calling Repentless [...] "a retro, workmanlike effort from a band determined to soldier on, and that's fine. There are hardcore devotees who never want their favorite bands to change; this is for them. But again, given all that's transpired since 2009, Slayer get points for even pulling this off." [...] The Guardian stated that [...] "Slayer have always been a model of consistency and a band that fans of vicious, vein-bursting heavy metal can rely on."

500|$|How far Hogarth sympathised with Pope is questionable. The {{original}} bill mocked him, but it featured in an image that, at the least, poked {{fun at the}} poor poet who was the subject. Hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for Pope or that he placed Pope's image above his head as a model to which to aspire. In the second image, which shows Pope and Curll locked in battle, {{it is not clear}} who has the upper hand, {{and by the time the}} print was issued the direct reference to Pope had been removed completely. Ronald Paulson, the preeminent modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that Hogarth would have viewed Pope, through his Roman Catholicism, as having been implicitly tied to the continental influences that Hogarth despised, and would have seen Pope's refusal to accept the patronage of the great men of the time, while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping the rewards they had to offer, as hypocritical. Pope was part of the circle that included William Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who had displaced Hogarth's father-in-law James Thornhill from commissions, and Hogarth also had ties to Lewis Theobald, a possible target of the satire, through illustrations he had produced for Theobald's Perseus and Andromeda, and through his subscription to Theobald's edition of the works of Shakespeare. Paulson suggests that the real [...] "villain" [...] of The Distrest Poet may be Pope, unseen but representing the successful [...] "Great Poet" [...] whom the deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate, rather than the distressed poet himself. [...] Hogarth had featured Pope picking John Gay's pocket in the foreground of Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme, an early print he had produced on the theme of the South Sea Bubble (both Pope and Gay had invested money in the scheme). At the same time, within the satire of the painting, the poet who is distressed is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Pope's dunces.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} season ended, Burke said he was uninterested in declaring for the 2012 NBA draft.

The deadline for entering the NBA draft was April 29, but the deadline for withdrawing a declaration and retaining NCAA eligibility was April 10. The deadline for submitting information to the NBA Advisory Committee for a 72-hour response was April 3. As Burke weighed his decision, he became involved in a controversy when the Michigan State Spartans athletic director Mark Hollis communicated with him directly via Twitter. Experts doubted his readiness for the draft, noting that notable NBA draft successes who were between [...] and [...] over the past 30 years (Terrell Brandon, Dana Barros, Brevin Knight, Damon Stoudamire, Mark Price and Michael Adams) waited past their freshman years to enter the draft. Nonetheless, CBS Sports reported on April 4 that Burke would declare for the draft. Burke's early departure for the NBA would have been the third in a row for a Michigan guard after Manny Harris in 2010 and Darius Morris in 2011. It would also have been the sixth scholarship-player departure from the team after two players graduated and three transferred. On April 9, Burke announced he would return to Michigan for his sophomore season instead of staying in the NBA draft. He decided to wait in hopes of becoming a more likely first round selection. During the summer, he spent 5–6 hour days with his trainer in Ohio.|$|E
