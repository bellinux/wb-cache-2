50|$|While reverberatory {{furnaces}} {{were very}} good at producing slags containing very little copper, they were relatively energy inefficient and produced a low concentration of sulfur dioxide in their off-gases that {{made it difficult to}} capture, and consequently, they have been supplanted by a new generation of copper smelting technologies. More recent furnaces have been designed based upon bath smelting, top jetting lance <b>smelting,</b> <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> and blast <b>furnaces.</b> Some examples of bath smelters include the Noranda furnace, the Isasmelt furnace, the Teniente reactor, the Vunyukov smelter and the SKS technology to name a few. Top jetting lance smelters include the Mitsubishi <b>smelting</b> reactor. <b>Flash</b> smelters account for over 50% of the world's copper smelters.

In 1995 a new, cleaner Outokumpu <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> was commissioned. By 2004, the annual average SO2 emissions from the stack were 161.5 lb/h (73 kg/h), below the permitted average annual level of 211 lb/h (96 kg/h) (with a three-hour permitted SO2 limit of 552 lb/h (250 kg/h)).|$|E

Increased levels of SiO 2 could potentially lead to an undesirably low Fe/SiO 2 in the settler slag, and this in turn can compromise the furnace side-wall integrity due to less protective magnetite accretion formation.

40|$|The {{previous}} inadequate {{treatment of}} off-gas in RTB Bor in Serbia {{has resulted in}} serious pollution {{of the environment and}} the possibly high losses of copper through the effluent flows. The project of New Copper Smelter RTB Bor, besides the new <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> (FSF) and the reconstruction of Pierce-Smith converter (PSC), includes more effective effluent treatment. Paper presents an analysis of the new FSF and PSC off-gas treatment, determination of copper losses throughout generated wastewaters and discussion of its possible valorization. Assumptions about the solubility of metals phases present in the FSF and PSC off-gas, obtained by the treatment process simulation, were compared with the leaching results of flue dusts. Determined wastewaters characteristics indicate that the PSC flow is significantly richer in copper, mostly present in insoluble metallic/sulfide form, while the FSF flow has low concentration of copper in the form of completely soluble oxide/sulfate. The possible scenario for the copper valorization, considering arsenic and lead as limiting factors, is the separation of the FSF and PSC flows, return of the metallic/sulfide solid phase to the smelting process and recovery from the sulfate/oxide liquid phase...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the studies}} related to copper flash {{smelting}} focuses on the burner and reaction shaft, while settler part of the furnace is not much evaluated. In the settler part, matte and slag separation take place, and it is critical in determining the final matte grade. In this thesis, a novel experimental procedure is employed to evaluate the time-dependent behavior of matte during settling process. Copper concentrate and synthetic slag mixture of known SiO 2 /Fe ratio was contacted at 1300 oC in air atmosphere and inert Argon atmosphere. The ratio corresponded to the actual fluxing ratio of an industrial <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> (SiO 2 /Fe 0. 7 – 1. 0). The experiments were carried out at several different reaction times, and subsequently analyzed with SEM-EDS to see the progression of matte-slag interactions and reactions. Additional experiments were also conducted by introducing 5 - 10 mm sized crushed printed circuit boards (PCB) to the mixture. These additional experiments provide initial analysis regarding how the minor metals in the PCB behave in copper smelting. A comprehensive and detailed information about the sequential steps leading to the matte settling from the slag are {{described in the present}} work. It was found that oxygen mass transport in slag is the limiting factor of the overall reaction rate. Separation and settling of matte ceased after 10 minutes, while continuous feeding of air leads to total loss of matte to the slag phase after just 5 minutes, with Cu content in the matte reaching peak level after 2 - 3 minutes. Precious metals in the PCB mostly distributed to the matte to create a Cu-Fe alloy phase distributed rather randomly within the matte. The novel procedure employed in the present work is generally sufficient to qualitatively elaborate the matte-slag separation process, but not quantitatively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Fe/SiO 2 {{ratio in}} slag {{is one of}} the {{important}} control parameters for copper <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> process, {{but it is difficult to}} describe the complex relationship between the technological parameters and the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in slag using accurate mathematic formulae, because the copper <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> process is a complicated nonlinear system. An neural network model for the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in copper <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> slag was developed, whose net structure is 8 - 15 - 12 - 1, and input nodes include the oxygen volume per ton concentrate, the oxygen grade, the flux rate, the quantity of Cu, S, Fe, SiO 2 and MgO in concentrate. In order to avoid local minimum terminations when the model is trained by back propagation (BP) algorithm, a new algorithm called GA-BP is presented by using genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the initial weights and threshold values. The results show that the model can avoid local minimum terminations and accelerate convergence, and has high prediction precision and good generalization performance.

At that time, the blast furnaces, the reverberatory furnaces and the electric furnaces with a small capacity, that were mainly located nearby the copper mines inland, were used for copper smelting. In the 1960 ’s to 1970 ’s the smelters increased their production to balance the rapid increase of domestic demand {{in the use of}} the imported copper concentrate because the price of domestic concentrate, that was exploited from the deeper face and processed from the lower grade ore than before, became much more expensive than the concentrate from abroad. In 1965 the coastal smelter and refinery complex was built by Onahama Smelting and Refining Co. Ltd. to gain an advantage over treatment of the imported concentrate. This smelter was equipped with two reverberatory furnaces that were the one of the largest reverberatory furnace in the world at that time and its original capacity was 72, 000 tonnes of copper/year.
