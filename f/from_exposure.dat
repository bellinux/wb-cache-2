40|$|Drawing on {{the network}} {{literature}} and attention-based view, we examine {{the extent to which}} international <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> key informal (geographically proximate firms) and formal (alliance partners) network relationships impacts new venture internationalization. Our findings are three-fold. First, international <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> both types of network relationships positively influence new venture internationalization, and serve as substitutes for each other. Second, the effects differ based on the age of the venture. While older ventures benefit more <b>from</b> international <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> alliance partners, younger ventures are more influenced by international <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> geographically proximate firms. Third, our analysis confirms a three-way interactive effect of age and international <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> informal and formal relationships on new venture internationalization...|$|R

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{summarise}} and review all studies that have examined potential adverse health effects of passive <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> inhaling e-cigarette vapour. Research objectives were to describe 1) the absolute impact of passive <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> inhaling vapour when compared with background, and 2) the relative impact of passive <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> inhaling vapour when compared with passive <b>exposure</b> <b>from</b> inhaling conventional cigarette smoke. The systematic review, which included  16 studies, found that those passively exposed to the vapours of e-cigarette users are exposed to numerous pollutants at levels above background and at concentrations that are associated with potential adverse health effects. The risk from being passively exposed to e-cigarette vapour is likely to be less than the risk <b>from</b> passive <b>exposure</b> to conventional cigarette smoke.  ...|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders <b>from</b> <b>exposure</b> to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
