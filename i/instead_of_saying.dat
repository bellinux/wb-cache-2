5|$|Mac {{decides to}} move to Sheffield {{to get a better}} job, taking Emily with him. Before he leaves, Mac bets Guy that he cannot sleep with Joanna. Guy accepts the bet and takes her home. However, Martin has {{discovered}} some shocking news and tries his best to stop them having sex, but is distracted by Karen's affections. Caroline does her best to break up the relationship between Mac and Emily, but it is Emily who breaks up with Mac. Caroline accused Emily of being a fake but was proved wrong. Mac found this amusing and so Emily dumps him. Mac then tells Caroline that he felt three things when she had accused his then girlfriend: he was impressed and amused, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> the third thing he kisses her.|$|E

25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> what he should have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer. But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon. Navid also returns and reveals that he wants to resume his relationship with Silver, who has found out she has the cancer gene. This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials. Naomi gets the shock of her life when she learns that the groom-to-be is none other than Max, her ex-boyfriend. At the bachelor party Max questions Naomi, asking her if he is doing the right thing, and before she can reply is interrupted by Max's fiancée. During the rehearsal wedding, Holly's mother offers Naomi a job offer that she cannot refuse. Naomi takes the offer, but at the airport is talked out of it by Austin because she is still in love with Max. As the wedding of Madison and Max begins, Naomi abruptly interrupts the services and confesses her love for Max. Elsewhere, Ivy is seen going off to Mexico to be with Diego, who was deported because he was an illegal immigrant in the U.S., and only ask for a one-way ticket. Diego and Ivy had begun dating and Diego had helped cease the pain she had been feeling after Raj's death. Diego was arrested for illegal graffiti, and that is why he was being deported. Annie and Caleb break off their relationship because Caleb cannot leave the covenant for Annie; nor does she think he should. Navid reveals that he isn't ready to have a baby, which causes Silver to dump him. She still wants to conceive a child and proposes to have a baby...with Teddy. At {{the very end of the}} season finale, Adrianna is boarding a plane to Las Vegas to kickstart her country music career because Dixon has not returned on time from the tour, but little does she know the car broke down and he had to hitchhike. As Dixon is on the phone with Navid telling him to stop Adrianna, a truck hits Dixon's car and it is left unknown if Dixon is still alive.|$|E

5000|$|The troupe system {{described}} above should {{be distinguished from}} the more commonly used term [...] "troupe-style play" [...] which was also popularized by Ars Magica. Troupe-style is generally use to mean that, <b>instead</b> <b>of,</b> <b>say,</b> a party <b>of</b> adventurers, with each player playing a single character, the players together form a larger group. In Ars Magica, for instance, each player creates a Wizard character. They then all create a lieutenant for that wizard, and then, finally, a number of grunt-style retainers.|$|R

Of his original {{decisions about the}} show's format, McGlaughlin says, [...] "It’s very hard to talk about music on the radio unless you can hear a sound, so I said I need a piano. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> 'a minor third,' I can play it.

2500|$|Batman {{generally}} acts disinterested around everyone, {{except for}} Spider-Man, whom he considers an [...] "acquaintance" [...] and who wonders why Batman's films are so popular. [...] <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I'm a DC," [...] Batman almost always introduces himself with, [...] "I'm Batman." [...] He {{seems to be}} the smartest of the heroes as he can telepathically communicate with Professor X. Batman also has an odd friendship with Iron Man, even after fighting over each other's films.|$|E
2500|$|The dialect {{spoken by}} {{inhabitants}} of such regions as Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean and Côte-Nord {{is characterized by}} long, stretched vowels {{in the middle of}} words, usually e or a in words such as père or case, pronounced as [...] and [...] Other examples include an eating of the letter r {{at the end of the}} words, so <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> cuisinière (...) , speakers might say instead cuisiniéille (...) , which contrasts with cuisinier (pronounced as [...] ).

5000|$|An {{advantage}} {{of using the}} pedological approach to study shallow water habitat is that soils are studied {{as a collection of}} horizons that are linked vertically with depth and horizontally across the subaqueous landscape. These horizons are studied and characterized by examining a combination of properties and characteristics, <b>instead</b> <b>of,</b> <b>say,</b> a single component or parameter. In this manner, subaqueous soil can be characterized as ecological map units and provide a site-based system to identify the geomorphic settings that represent the subaqueous landscape.

2500|$|The philosopher Walter Kaufmann {{has argued}} that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of {{traditional}} Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes, and [...] "sometimes could not resist equating" [...] his conception of spirit (Geist) [...] "with God, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me." [...] Kaufmann {{also points out that}} Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of {{his network}} {{assignments}} was The Morning Show, CBS' short-lived challenge to NBC's Today in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as [...] "one of the highlights" [...] of the show. He added, [...] "A puppet can render opinions on {{people and things}} that a human commentator would not feel free to utter. I was and I am proud of it." [...] Cronkite also angered the R. J.

40|$|Why is patria (“fatherland”) a {{feminine}} noun? How {{is it that}} virtus (“courage”), though etymologically linked with the masculine vir, is also {{a feminine}} noun? And more vexingly, {{what is it about}} a book (liber) that makes it masculine <b>instead</b> <b>of,</b> <b>say,</b> neuter? When first-year Latin students ask these sorts of questions, our immediate impulse is to reassure them that grammatical gender is just that—grammatical. Trying to divine some underlying sexual characteristic that makes courage feminine or a book masculine is not only futile but also counterproductive to early language learning.

2500|$|After {{several months}} of speech that is {{restricted}} to short utterances, children enter the [...] "telegraphic stage" [...] and begin to produce longer and more complex grammatical structures (O'Grady & Cho, 2011, p.347). This stage is characterized by production of complex structures as children begin to form phrases consisting of a subject and a complement in addition to use of modifiers and composition of full sentences. Children use mostly content words and their sentences lack function words. For example, a child may say [...] "fill cup water," [...] <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Fill my cup with water." [...] Subsequently, language acquisition continues to develop rapidly and children begin to acquire complex grammar that shows understanding of intricate linguistic features, {{such as the ability}} to switch the position of words in sentences.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bjelland {{moved from}} Portland to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland. She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't {{know how to play}} when I met her. Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper.

2500|$|Despite the {{alphabetic}} {{nature of}} its script, Manchu was not taught phoneme by phoneme per letter like western languages are, rather, Manchu children were taught to memorize all the syllables in the Manchu language separately as they learned to write, like Chinese characters. Manchus when learning, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> l, a---la; l, o---lo; etc., were taught at once to say la, lo, etc. Many more syllables than are contained in their syllabary might have been formed with their letters, {{but they were not}} accustomed to arrange them otherwise than as they there stand. They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants I, m, n, and r, as westerners do when they called them liquid; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r, t, were joined in that order, a Manchu would not able to pronounce them as English speaking people pronounce the word [...] "smart".

2500|$|The symbol {{was adopted}} by Charles V and {{was part of his}} coat of arms {{representing}} Spain's American possessions. The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver. The coin, also known as Spanish dollar, was the first global currency used in the entire world since the Spanish Empire was the first global Empire. These coins, depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small [...] "S"-shaped ribbon around each, were spread throughout America, Europe and Asia. According to this, traders wrote signs that, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> Spanish dollar (piece of eight, real de a ocho in Spanish or peso duro), had this symbol made by hand, and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars. When the US got independence from the UK, they created the American dollar, but in the first decades they still used the Spanish dollar because they were more popular in all markets.|$|E
2500|$|Nehemia Gordon argued that, though modern {{scholars}} universally {{take the}} pronunciation of YHWH to be YAH-weh, the proper pronunciation is ye-ho-VAH. He {{claimed that the}} Masoretes belonged {{to the group of}} Karaites who did not pronounce the name and for that reason omitted the middle vowel O (as seen in the earliest complete manuscripts of the Tanakh), [...] "to prevent their fellow Karaites from simply reading the name as it was written". However, Gordon also published an article translated in 1971 from the Hebrew by Ḥakham Avraham Ben-Raḥamiël Qanaï, which was a study by the late Ḥakham Mordekhai Alfandari, according to which the proper and original pronunciation of the Name is [...] "Yihweh". Rather than attempt an uncertain pronunciation of the divine name, some, such as Eliezer Ben Ephraim HaKohen [...] have argued that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Adonai" [...] the term [...] "YAH" [...] should be used based upon its usage in Psalms 68:4.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to being}} removed from an active music scene, the two MC's {{were free to}} develop their most {{idiosyncratic}} tendencies musically.

Weston stated that [...] "except for Brand Nubian, we weren't influenced by {{what was going on in}} New York. Basically we wanted to be different and we wanted to be dope like Brand Nubian... So <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> 'I got a lot of balls,' we'd say, 'I got more nuts than a Baby Ruth.'" [...] Hines also felt being away from the environment helped their personal artistic growth. [...] "We just wasn't exposed to that many styles at the time, so it helped us form our own."
