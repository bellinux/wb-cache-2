40|$|The {{hematopoietic system}} is {{responsible}} for transporting oxygen and nutrients, fighting infections, and repairing tissue damage. Hematopoietic system dysfunction therefore causes a range of serious health consequences. Lifelong hematopoiesis is maintained by repopulating multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that replenish shorter-lived, mature blood cell types. A prokaryotic mechanism of immunity, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) /Cas 9 nuclease system, has been recently "repurposed" to mutate mammalian genomes efficiently and in a sequence-specific manner. The application of this genome-editing technology to hematology has afforded new approaches for functional genomics and even the prospect of "correcting" dysfunctional HSCs {{in the treatment of}} serious genetic hematological diseases. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of three recent CRISPR/Cas 9 methods in hematology: gene disruption, gene targeting, and saturating mutagenesis. We also summarize the technical considerations and advice provided during the May 2017 <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Experimental <b>Hematology</b> New Investigator Committee webinar on the same topic...|$|R
