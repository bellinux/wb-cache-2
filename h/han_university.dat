5|$|Van der Sloot (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, Natalee Holloway, who was declared legally dead six years after she disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van der Sloot remained in custody. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van Der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the results of the investigation. On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the <b>HAN</b> <b>University</b> of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police to collect evidence to solve the case.|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} will future demands of {{worldwide}} operating parties, regarding the (tertiary) packaging of their freight flows, determine or influence the future dimensions of freight trucks? That {{is the question}} we address to in this paper. In this study we have studied what container sizes may fit in the future demands of world trade and freight flows. We have identified several trends and studied its possible impact on the sizes of the truck of the future. Two serial projects {{have been carried out}} {{within the framework of the}} HTAS-EMS research program, in which amongst others MAN, University of Technology Eindhoven, TNO and <b>HAN</b> <b>University</b> of Applied Sciences cooperate in order to determine the requirements for the truck of the future. The first two projects of this research program have been carried out in order to determine possible influences of: • packaging on the requirement of Logistic Service Providers for the next generation of trucks (project I); • the pallet as an influence on the opportunities for intermodality of transport units, within the context of EU trade with emerging economies (project II). The first research project was part of a dissertation program for the MSc program in Logistics and Supply Chain management of the University of Westminster (project I); the second, of a BBA program in Logistics of <b>HAN</b> <b>University</b> of Applied Sciences (project II) ...|$|E

Methods: In Step 1 of the IM protocol, a needs assessment was performed consisting of {{a review of the}} Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines on CANS, and of focus group sessions with employees with CANS (n= 15) and with relevant experts (n= 17). After the needs assessment, the objectives of the intervention and the determinants of self-management at work were formulated (Step 2). Furthermore, theory-based intervention methods and practical strategies were selected (Step 3), and an intervention program (including the eHealth module) was developed (Step 4). Finally, plans for implementation and evaluation of the program were developed (Steps 5 and 6). Results: Step 1 of the IM protocol revealed that employees with CANS should be stimulated to search for information about the cause of their complaints, {{about how to deal with}} their complaints, and in which manner they can influence their complaints themselves. In Step 2, the overall goal of the intervention was defined as “self-management behavior at work” with the aim to alleviate the perceived disability of the participants. Step 3 described how the intervention methods were translated into practical strategies, and goal setting was introduced as an important method for increasing self-efficacy. The product of Step 4 was the final program plan, consisting of 6 -weekly group sessions of 2. 5 hours each and an eHealth module. In Step 5, a recruitment plan and course materials were developed, a steering committee was set up, trainers were recruited, and the final program was tested. In Step 6, an evaluation plan was developed, which consists of a randomized controlled trial with a 12 -month follow-up period and a qualitative evaluation (interviews) with some of the participants. Conclusion: This study resulted in a theory- and practice-based self-management program, based on behavioral change theories, guideline-related evidence, and practice-based knowledge that fits the needs of employees with CANS.

For this purpose a test facility is used with the possibility to test all important functional aspects of a PEM fuel cell hybrid power train. In this paper the first experimental results of the testing of the power train are presented, driving a drive cycle designed especially for this automated guided vehicle. Experimental results are compared to results for this specific drive cycle from the simulation of the power train with the QSS-toolbox, using a simple battery model of our specific energy storage situation. Further some recommendations for improvement of the test facility are given, resulting from restrictions encountered during the experiments...|$|E
