5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought {{that some of the}} earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E

5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
5|$|For his {{discovery}} of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His {{discovery of the}} neutron {{made it possible to}} produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number}} of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of DAB is that due {{to the use of}} multiplexing technology and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that an athlete {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E
5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
