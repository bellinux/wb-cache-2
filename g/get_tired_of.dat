500|$|The Way I See It has a {{traditional}} soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul. It is {{a departure from}} Saadiq's previous work with neo soul, which bears a hip hop influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond {{his work as a}} producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a [...] "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". BBC Music's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of [...] "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-Obama expression of hope in record form." [...] Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction {{as a response to the}} state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: [...] "You force so many terrible things on people, they <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> it.

500|$|Andrew Male {{rated the}} film {{two out of}} five in Empire. Male called it [...] "technically stunning", but also [...] "dreadfully acted, tediously 'profound' and painfully overlong", and accused the {{director}} of misogyny. The Village Voices Karina Longworth had several reservations about the film. She thought that the characters lacked emotional depth and called the story [...] "a lame fusion of stoner lifestyle, sexual fetish, and philosophical inquiry", but still ended the review: [...] "I could stare at this movie for days and not <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the sensation. A mash-up of the sacred, the profane, and the brain-dead, Enter the Void is addictive." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post thought that the film was successful as an [...] "attempt to transport moviegoers to a hallucinatory version of the hereafter unlike anything they've ever witnessed on film", but added: [...] "The problem is that it's also the most excruciating sit in recent cinematic memory. And no, the fact that it's intentionally excruciating doesn't make it less excruciating." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{squadron}} armourers {{and mechanics}} repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on {{his most recent}} S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6 May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron's squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed {{to take part in}} the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote [...] "I do <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer.

500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E
500|$|Martin Campbell {{spent three}} days of {{preparation}} on the [...] "Box" [...] set, analyzing it from every angle to learn {{the feel of the}} room. Fontana comes from a playwriting background, and [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting, much like a play. The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day, and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting. According to Fontana, Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice, [...] "So the entire hour keeps changing {{the point of view of}} the camera, so that you never <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being in that room." [...] While filming the episode, Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue, then film the scene again from another angle. Braugher said the experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode, and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances. Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script, Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own, particularly during the fast-paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker.|$|E
500|$|Masashi Hamauzu {{composed}} the game's soundtrack. His previous {{work on the}} series was as a co-composer for Final Fantasy X and as the main composer for [...] The game was the first main-series Final Fantasy game not to include any compositions by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu; although he was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role {{was taken over by}} Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy XIV. Game producer Yoshinori Kitase chose Hamauzu because he felt that Hamauzu would be the best for the job as he was composing an orchestral-based soundtrack then for Dirge of Cerberus and the Final Fantasy XIII team wanted that style for the game. Hamauzu described the soundtrack in the liner notes for the soundtrack album as comprising multiple genres of music so that the player would not <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> it, while also using several motifs so as to tie the varying pieces together; particularly in grouping the themes from the Cocoon and Pulse areas in the game. He tried to match each piece and theme to his sense of the narrative and characters involved in the scenes that they would be played in, and feels that being the sole composer for the project allowed him to ensure that the overall direction of the soundtrack was consistent.|$|E

500|$|Months later, {{during an}} April 1988 {{appearance}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump discussed his displeasure with the United States' {{status as a}} [...] "debtor nation" [...] and its seeming inability to compete with Japan. [...] Winfrey asked Trump if he would ever run for president. [...] He replied, [...] "Probably not, but I do <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> seeing the country get ripped off ... I just don't think I have the inclination to do it." [...] Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would win the election.

500|$|UPN {{announced}} that Busy Philipps was cast as Denise on July 25, {{and was later}} billed as the show's star. According to Vince Vieluf, the casting change from Doherty to Philipps led to the series being retooled as an ensemble show featuring {{all the members of}} the agency rather than focusing on Denise. Vieluf said the alterations in the series' premise were due to concerns that [...] "people would <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> a show that was only about the mishaps of one person's love life". Page Kennedy reported that he was considered for a part on the show, but rejected it for the role of Caleb Applewhite on the second season of the ABC drama Desperate Housewives. Retired Los Angeles Lakers player Rick Fox guest starred in three episodes as David, one of Clea's love interests. The casting of racially diverse actors was identified with UPN's position as [...] "the only network to actively program for an African American audience". Tim Good of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed to the show's casting as the only way in which it acts as a [...] "positive reference". Even though the show was set in New York City, filming took place in the Bluhdorn Building at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, and used the multiple-camera format. Aaron Korsh wrote the nineteenth episode as freelance work. Each episode title, with the exception of the pilot, was taken from the names of past sitcoms. Transitions between scenes feature images of New York City set to contemporary music, such as The Black Eyed Peas' single [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart" [...] and Kelis' single [...] "Milkshake". Todd R. Ramlow of PopMatters described the music as a further attempt to appeal to [...] "an 'urban', black-white audience," [...] and praised it as a [...] "nice try at crossover for a network whose shows usually target a black demographic".|$|E
500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E
