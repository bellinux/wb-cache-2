25|$|Justice White {{authored}} the dissent, {{joined by}} Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens. In noting his {{disagreement with the}} other Justices, Justice White argues that the third part of the O'Brien test (requiring that the law be unrelated to the suppression of free expression) is not satisfied. In pursuing legitimate government interests, the statute in place restricts conduct - nudity - that is integral to the expressive nature of the act. Citing Schad v. Borough of Mt. Ephraim (1981), the dissent remarks that the condition of human nakedness {{in and of itself}} does not transform otherwise protected speech into unprotected speech. Justice White argues that it <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of the heightened expressive impact that the state chooses to forbid public nudity, because the state desires to control the negative secondary effects such as prostitution and degradation of women. Because nudity {{is an essential part of}} the potency of the expression in question, the law unconstitutionally restricts that expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose and}} content of a {{response}} is also an issue that PDPs seek to make explicit. There is considerable disagreement {{as to how to}} effectively communicate meaning and intent across what would likely be formidable language barriers. The message would need to be crafted {{in such a way that}} its content and delivery were unambiguous to receivers that may not even use written or verbal communication. Several mathematic, pictorial, algorithmic, and [...] "natural" [...] language theories have been developed and applied to the problem of CETI. A specific purpose or goal of outgoing transmissions may be covered by a PDP as well. Several possible functions exist, including: a description of our species and planet, a request for information, and/or the proposition of some course of action. However, in the absence of an intergovernmental agreement or structures for building consensus on the subject, nations, groups, and individuals are free to act autonomously. It <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> the process of sculpting a collective message would be slow and laborious (but intensely important), that most scientists recommend having a PDP with some prescribed action laid out before contact is made.|$|E
2500|$|In the eleventh-century, Sufism, {{which had}} {{previously}} been a less [...] "codified" [...] trend in Islamic piety, began to be [...] "ordered and crystallized" [...] into orders which have continued until the present day. All these orders were founded by a major Islamic saint, {{and some of the}} largest and most widespread included the Qadiriyya (after Abdul-Qadir Gilani [...] ), the Rifa'iyya (after Ahmed al-Rifa'i [...] ), the Chishtiyya (after Moinuddin Chishti [...] ), the Shadiliyya (after Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili [...] ), and the Naqshbandiyya (after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari [...] ). Contrary to popular perception in the West, however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims, and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam. Thus, the Qadiriyya order was Hanbali, with its founder, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, being a renowned Hanbali jurist; the Chishtiyya was Hanafi; the Shadiliyya order was Maliki; and the Naqshbandiyya order was Hanafi. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> it is historically proven that [...] "many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Ghazali, and the Sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn (Saladin) were connected with Sufism" [...] that the popular studies of writers like Idris Shah are continuously disregarded by scholars as conveying the fallacious image that [...] "Sufism" [...] is somehow distinct from [...] "Islam." ...|$|E

More important, the Bolsheviks unwittingly helped to foster religious revival in the 1920s: by demolishing the institutional church and shifting the authority to the parish, they helped to empower parishioners, above all, religious aktivisty.
