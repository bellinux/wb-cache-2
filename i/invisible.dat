5|$|During {{its debut}} {{week in the}} United Kingdom, the game reached #3 in the charts, {{described}} as a respectable debut. In their financial report in April 2005, Eidos reported that <b>Invisible</b> War was among the titles to have sold between 500,000 and one million copies since release, placing it among their successful titles. As of April 2011, <b>Invisible</b> War has sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide, placing it above the original game in terms of copies sold.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>Invisible</b> War, {{multiple}} {{attempts were made to}} create a third Deus Ex title, even after both Spector and Smith left Ion Storm. The two main projects were dubbed Deus Ex: Insurrection, which used the same engine as <b>Invisible</b> War while moving away from its divisive mechanics; and Deus Ex 3, which aimed to be an open world game with a branching narrative. Prospective development on the third Deus Ex game was halted when, following further staff departure and financial difficulties, the studio's owner Eidos Interactive closed them down in 2005. A separate project developed by Crystal Dynamics, intended as the fourth Deus Ex project following Insurrection and titled Des Ex: Clan Wars, was reworked as Project Snowblind. <b>Invisible</b> War was the last Deus Ex game developed by Ion Storm prior to its closure.|$|E

5|$|The <b>invisible</b> rail is superficially {{similar to}} the purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, which has {{recently}} been found in Halmahera, but that species is larger, with a short, thick red bill and a red forehead shield; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail. The <b>invisible</b> rail {{is different from the}} Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis, in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species; there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species.|$|E

50|$|A nation {{may have}} a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the <b>invisibles</b> balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) - if, for example, there are large {{payments}} made to foreign businesses for <b>invisibles</b> such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the <b>invisibles</b> balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.|$|R

5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are <b>invisible</b> to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are <b>invisible</b> from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the <b>invisible</b> rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the <b>invisible</b> rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Invisibles</b> was {{published}} in 1903 and was considered [...] "a curious example of subculture trying to move up." [...] Perhaps conceived before its time, The <b>Invisibles</b> {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a modern-style science fiction thriller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first volume}} of The <b>Invisibles</b> {{introduces}} Dane McGowan, an angry teen from Liverpool, as he attempts to burn down his school. Abandoned by his father and neglected by his mother, Dane takes out his anger and frustration through destruction. In {{the first issue of}} the series, Dane is recruited by the <b>Invisibles,</b> a ragtag band of freedom fighters led by King Mob, a charismatic, cold-blooded assassin. The next arc, [...] "Down and Out in Heaven and Hell", shows Dane as he tries to survive on his own in London after being abandoned by the <b>Invisibles.</b> Dane is mentored by Tom O'Bedlam, an elderly homeless man who is secretly a member of the <b>Invisibles.</b> Tom shows Dane the magic in the everyday world and helps him realize that his anger prevents him from experiencing real emotions. While wandering with Tom, Dane has a partially remembered alien abduction experience and is transported into a different dimension. Eventually Dane returns to the <b>Invisibles,</b> taking the codename [...] "Jack Frost". The next arc, [...] "Arcadia", follows the <b>Invisibles</b> as they go back in time via astral projection to the French Revolution. Jack is almost killed by a demonic agent of the Outer Church, the Invisibles’ chief enemy. As the arc closes, Jack declares that he is leaving the <b>Invisibles.</b>|$|R

5|$|Development of <b>Invisible</b> War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop <b>Invisible</b> War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both <b>Invisible</b> War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially <b>invisible</b> in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made <b>invisible</b> by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E

The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E
