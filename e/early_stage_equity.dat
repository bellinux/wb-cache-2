40|$|The {{nature and}} role of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>equity</b> {{financing}} {{in the development of}} emerging entrepreneurial ventures in the software industry is examined. To provide an understanding {{of the relationship between the}} suppliers of capital and the ventures they bankroll, issues concerning equity positions and holding periods are addressed. Given the unique position of private investors in the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>equity</b> market, particular attention is given to the characteristics of these investors and the investor characteristics germane to the software industry. Results for the software sector are compared with technology-based companies in an attempt to uncover any discernable differences between the two groups. The research hypothesizes that there are differences in the informal venture capital market among broadly defined sectors in terms of the sectors 2 ̆ 7 technology and competitive conditions and their impact on: first, the need for, and timing of, external equity capital; and secondly, the characteristics and value-added contributions of the private investors attracted to the sector...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} UK {{public policy}} addressing the seed and <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>equity</b> finance gap since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Drawing on {{lessons learned from}} recent studies of UK and international government equity schemes, two contemporary models of government backed equity finance are examined. The {{focus is on the}} Enterprise Capital Funds (ECFs) and the Angel Co-investment Fund (ACF), the UK government’s main schemes operating in the sub-£ 2 m equity finance gap to address the capital requirements for developing the UK’s young, potential high growth businesses. The paper highlights the shortcomings of traditional interim fund performance analysis and presents current demand and supply side evidence that establishes that these schemes are making attributable impacts on their portfolio businesses and the wider UK economy. It also demonstrates that they are playing important roles in the establishment of a new post GFC UK finance escalator. However, whilst these schemes were found to be currently complementary and effective, their future roles within the UK’s evolving post GFC seed and <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>equity</b> markets are also considered.

Early diagnosis of AD improves {{quality of life for}} patients and caregivers by allowing for participation in disease slowing interventions. However, early diagnosis of AD may have unintentional psychological and social consequences for patients and caregivers. To combat these potential consequences, it is important that psychosocial interventions, such as support groups, are available at the time of diagnosis. A review of literature demonstrated that <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD patients and their informal caregivers benefited from support groups attended by both patients and caregivers, referred to as <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD patient-caregiver dyad (PCD) support groups. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the need for <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD PCD support groups in rural areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the need for <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD PCD support groups in rural WA.

Twelve informal caregivers and five community members who did not have AD or care for someone with <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD were included in data analysis. Results demonstrated that participants lacked information about <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> AD PCD support groups and barriers to accessing these groups.

40|$|Context: Software effort {{estimation}} at <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> is {{a crucial}} task for project bedding and feasibility study. Since collected data at <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development lifecycle is always imprecise and uncertain, {{it is very hard}} to deliver accurate estimate. Analogy-based estimation, which is one of the popular estimation methods, is rarely used at <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> because of uncertainty associated with attribute measurement and data availability. Objective: in order to improve performance of analogy-based estimation at <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> using all available early data, we integrated it with Fuzzy numbers. Particularly, this paper proposes a new software project similarity measure and a new adaptation technique based on Fuzzy numbers in order to support analogy-based estimation at <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development lifecycle. Method: Empirical evaluation with Jack-knifing procedure carried out, using five benchmark data sets of software projects, namely, ISBSG, Desharnais, Kemerer, Albrecht and COCOMO, are reported. The results are compared to those obtained by methods employed in the literature using case-based reasoning and stepwise regression. Results: In all data sets the empirical evaluations have shown that the proposed similarity measure and adaptation techniques method were able to remarkably improve the performance of analogy-based estimation at <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development. The results have also shown the proposed method outperforms some well know estimation techniques such as case-based reasoning and stepwise regression. Conclusions: It is concluded that the proposed estimation model could form a useful approach for <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> estimation especially when data is almost uncertain...|$|R
