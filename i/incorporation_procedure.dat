Since {{it is difficult to}} obtain a homogeneous dispersion of these nanoparticles, the mechanical improvement of the composites is very moderate. Thermoplastic nanofibrous structures can overcome this issue. Therefore, this paper investigated the effect of electrospun polyamide 6 nanofibrous structures on the mechanical properties of a glass fiber/epoxy composite. The nanofibers are incorporated in the glass fiber/epoxy composite as stand-alone interlayered structures and directly spun on the glass fiber reinforcement. Both <b>incorporation</b> <b>procedures</b> have no negative effect on the impregnation of the epoxy. Incorporation of nanofibers increases the stress at failure in the 0 °-direction, the best results are obtained when the nanofibers are directly electrospun on the glass fibers. Optical microscopic images also demonstrate that nanofibers prevent delamination when a 90 ° crack reaches a neighbourly 0 ° ply. When the composites are loaded under 45 °, it is proven that for an identical stress, the glass fiber composite with deposited nanofibers has less cracks than when interlayered nanofibrous structures are incorporated...|$|R

Proteoliposomes containing cytochrome c oxidase were fused with the bacterial membrane vesicles {{by means of a}} freeze/thaw sonication technique. Evidence that membrane fusion has taken place is presented by the demonstration that nonexchangeable fluorescent phospholipid probes, originally present only in the bacterial membrane or only in the liposomal membrane, are diluted in the membrane after fusion and, by sucrose gradient centrifugation, indicating a buoyant density of the membranes after fusion in between those of the starting membrane preparations. The fused membranes are endowed with a relatively low ion permeability which makes it possible to generate a high proton motive force (100 mV, inside negative and alkaline) by cytochrome-c-oxidase-mediated oxidation of the electron donor system ascorbate/N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine/cytochrome c. In the fused membranes this proton motive force can drive the uptake of several amino acids via secondary transport systems.

A modified [3 H]leucine protocol was developed by coupling previously described incubation and alkaline extraction protocols with microdialysis (500 molecular weight cutoff membrane) of the final radiolabeled protein extract. The incorporation of [3 H]leucine into protein exhibited a biphasic saturation curve, with lower apparent Km values ranging from 400 nM to 4. 2 μM depending on the plant species studied. Upper apparent Km values ranged from 1. 3 to 59 μM.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{demonstrated that}} Schwann cells from permanently transected sciatic nerves of adult rats synthesize basal {{levels of the}} major myelin glycoprotein (P 0). This denervated preparation at 35 days after transection was characterized {{by the absence of}} both axons and myelin assembly. The present investigation demonstrates that production of P 0 continues after culture of the Schwann cells as endoneurial slices for 14 days. Thus, the level of differentiation is unchanged in culture even though only basal levels of P 0 are produced and post-translational processing is incomplete. In contrast, Schwann cells from 4 -day-old rat sciatic nerves actively synthesized P 0 and assembled myelin membrane; however, after only 4 days in culture biosynthesis of P 0 ceased. Because the same culture conditions and precursor <b>incorporation</b> <b>procedures</b> were used for both neonatal and transected nerves, it is proposed that neonatal Schwann cells in culture return to a progenitor state that is not capable of P 0 gene expression. This comparison, both before and after culture, of neonatal Schwann cells that are programmed to myelinate and Schwann cells from the adult transected nerve that were in a myelin-maintaining mode provides a useful model for investigating the mechanisms by which differential gene expression is controlled. These results confirm that axons are not necessary for specifying P 0 gene expression by Schwann cells from the adult transected nerves. The role that axons play in controlling P 0 gene expression by neonatal Schwann cells in culture, however, has yet to be determined. It is concluded that the differentiation and maturation of Schwann cells is multistage process that allows the sequential production of specific gene products...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} four decades, one of the {{fastest-growing}} fields of research in economics has been the contractual theory of the firm developed in Coase???s (1937) footsteps. Yet despite what otherwise seems to be a genuine success story the question {{of the nature of the}} firm remains an empirical and theoretical challenge, painfully illustrated by the lack of consensus regarding the definition and boundaries of the firm. The argument of this thesis is that many thorny questions that plague the literature, including issues related to ownership, boundaries, and intra-firm authority, are due to the fact that contractual theorists of the firm have generally overlooked a key legal feature of the economic system, without which theories of the firm are like Hamlet without the Prince. An elementary institutional fact about firms and markets is that in order to become a fully operational firm in a modern market economy, an entrepreneur or an association of resource owners need to go through a registration or <b>incorporation</b> <b>procedure</b> by which the legal system creates a separate legal person or legal entity in which ownership rights over assets used in production are vested, in whose name contracts are made, and thanks to which the firm has standing in court. With this assignment of legal personality, the legal system creates the efficiency-enhancing nexus for contracts that literally carries the organizational framework of the firm, and secures its continuity by locking-in the founders??? committed capital, thereby allowing them to pledge assets, raise finance and do business in the firm???s own name. Given the basic principle that only legal persons may own property and have the capacity to contract, and the implication that legally enforceable contracts can only exist between legal persons, it is something of a paradox that the notion of legal personality is absent from the prevailing narrative in the contractual theory of the firm. The thesis examines the reasons behind this state of affairs, and identifies alongside the widespread view among economists that firms can be defined with little or no reference to law, particularly statutory law, the lasting influence of Jensen and Meckling???s (1976) ambiguous dismissal of legal personality as a legal fiction that unavoidably leads to misleading reification. In order to disentangle the issues involved, the thesis puts this argument into historical perspective, and suggests that much can be learned from the corporate personality controversy that in the past has addressed the same questions. As the overview of the history of this debate reveals, the category mistakes that Jensen and Meckling presented as inevitable can be easily avoided once the meaning and functions of legal personality are properly understood. The thesis dispels enduring misunderstandings surrounding the notion of personhood, and proposes a legally-grounded view of the nature and boundaries of the firm that recognizes in law???s provision of legal entity status a fundamental institutional support for the firm while fitting the overall Coasean narrative...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of modern technology, nanomatrials, such as {{nanoparticles}} (NP), nanorods (NR), quantum dots (QD) etc. are, probably, the most prominent and promising candidates for current and future technological applications. The interest in nanomaterials arise not only form the continuous tendency towards dimensions minimisation of electronic devices, but also due to the fact, that new and, often, unique properties are acquired by the matter at the length scale between 1 and 100 nm. The ability to organize nanoparticles into ordered arrays extends the range of useful NP-based systems that can be fabricated and the diversity of functionalities they can serve. However, in order to successfully exploit nanoparticle assemblies in technological applications and to ensure efficient scale-up, {{a high level of}} direction and control is required. Recently, block copolymers (BCP) have attracted much attention as a powerful and very promising tool for creation of nanoscale ordered structures owing to their self-assembling properties. In addition, these systems offer the possibility to fabricate nanostructured composite materials via incorporation of certain nanoadditives (i. e. NPs). The concept is that by selective inclusion of the nanoparticles into one of the blocks of a self-assembling copolymer, the nanoparticles are forced into a defined spatial arrangement determined by the phase morphology of the block copolymer. In present work self-assembling phenomena of block copolymers was exploited to fabricate binary (NP/BCP) and ternary (NP 1 /NP 2 /BCP) composites, filled with pre-synthesized nanoparticles of various nature. Polystyrene-block-polyvinylpyridine block copolymers (PS-b-PVP) of various composition and molecular weight were used for fabrication of nanocomposites. The first part of the thesis focuses on fabrication of functional BCP-based composites containing magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), selectively assembled within one of the blocks of BCP matrix. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were selected among others since, as for today, there is the least number of successful results reported in literature on their selective incorporation into one of the phases of a BCP matrix. From the application point of view fabrication of periodic arrays of “magnetic domains” with periodicity on nanometer scale is also of interest for potential use in high-density magnetic data storage devices. For this purpose, ferrite-type MNP (Fe 3 O 4, CoFe 2 O 4) having apparent affinity toward polyvinylpyridine (PVP) phase were prepared using simple one-pot synthesis. Highly selective nanoparticles segregation into PVP domains of BCP was achieved owing to the presence of sparse stabilizing organic shell on the nanoparticles surface. Importantly, as-prepared MNPs did not require any additional surface modification step to acquire affinity towards PVP phase. Appropriate selection of annealing conditions allowed to produce patterns of nearly perfect degree of lateral order over relatively large surface large area (more than 4 sq µm). The second task of present work was fabrication of ternary NP 1 /NP 2 /BCP hybrid composites with two different types of nanoparticles being selectively localized in different microdomains of phase segregated block copolymer matrix. So far as only few studies have been reported on developing of approaches toward ternary composites, creation of alternative and straight forward routes toward such systems is still a challenge. In the frame of this part of present work, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) covered with polystyrene shell were prepared, with the purpose to be incorporated into polystarene phase of phase separated PS-b-PVP block copolymer matrix. Two different approaches were tested to achieve desired three-component system. First, supposed simple blending of block copolymer and two kinds of nanoparticles having specific affinity toward different blocks of BCP in common solvent. After preparation of MNP/AgNP/BCP composite thin film and subsequent solvent vapour annealing, different domains of microphase segregated PS-b-PVP BCP were filled with different type of nanoparticles. Alternatively, step-wise approach for nanoparticles incorporation was developed and implemented for successful selective nanoparticles incorporation. For this purpose polystyrene stabilized AgNPs (i. e. NP 1) were initially mixed with PS-b-PVP BCP to produce composite thin films having nanoparticles selectively located within PS microdomains, while citrate-stabilized second type nanoparticles (i. e NP 2) were deposited from their aqueous solutions into PVP domains of AgNP/PS-b-PVP composites. By partition of nanoparticles <b>incorporation</b> <b>procedure</b> into two distinct steps it was also possible to increase effective loading of each type of NPs into BCP matrix...|$|E

A plant designed on the basis of steady-state considerations alone could exhibit poor dynamic characteristics, leading to a loss of economic performance and a reduced capacity to effectively handle safety and environmental constraints. This motivates the need for the development of quantitative techniques for dynamic operability assessment, as well as its <b>incorporation</b> into <b>procedures</b> for process plant design. Optimization-based approaches to dynamic operability assessment permit simultaneous consideration of performance-limiting factors of nonminimum phase characteristics, input constraints and model uncertainty, and also provide considerable flexibility in the choice of performance criteria, decision variables and constraints. Recent work has incorporated operability requirements as constraints within a single optimal plant design problem formulation (Mohideen et at., 1997; Bahri et at., 1996). Young and Swartz (1997) considered the rigorous inclusion of input saturation effects in optimizing control. Actuator saturation introduces discontinuities in the system model and, to avoid potential problems using a sequential optimization approach, two alternative formulations were proposed for solving the problem within a simultaneous solution framework. Input saturation discontinuities were handled by the introduction of slack variables and their inclusion in either bilinear or mixed-integer constraints resulting in a nonlinear or mixed-integer linear programming problem respectively. The formulations were applied to a linear system with dead time to find the economically optimal operating point for a controller with fixed structure and tunings when disturbance deviations are taken into account. It was shown that using a strictly linear controller in this case would lead to an overly conservative estimate of the feasible operating range and consequently, a suboptimal operating point...|$|R
