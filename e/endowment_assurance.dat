40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} how model misspecification {{associated with}} both interest rate and mortality risk influences hedging decisions of insurance companies. For this purpose, diverse risk management strategies which are risk–minimizing when model risk is ignored come into consideration. The {{effectiveness of these}} strategies is investigated {{by looking at the}} distribution of the resulting hedging er-rors under the combination of both sources of model risk. The analysis is based on <b>endowment</b> <b>assurances</b> which include an investment element together with a sum assured. Normally, the customer contributes periodic premiums. Compared to an upfront premium, this poses an additional risk to the insurance company. Since the premium payments stop {{in the case of an}} early death, it is not known today how many premium payments will be forthcoming. Theoretically, a loan corresponding to the present value of the expected delayed premium payments must be asked for by the insurance company in order to implement his hedging decisions. Therefore, we also consider how model risk affects this borrowing decision...|$|R
40|$|Although {{assurance}} {{companies are}} pooling many risks, {{the law of}} large numbers does not fully apply. This leaves the companies with a possibility of insolvency and a corresponding need for contingency reserves which are matters of serious concern. In this thesis we derive some fundamental results that are useful {{when the time comes}} to set contingency reserves or to assess solvency. We use a model where both the mortality and the interest rates are random variables. We choose to model the force of interest by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For temporary <b>assurances</b> and <b>endowment</b> <b>assurances</b> we derive an efficient recursive method to find the first three moments of the present value of a portfolio of identical policies. We then use these moments to approximate accurately the distribution of the present value of such a portfolio, firstly when the number of policies in the portfolio tends to infinity, and secondly, for a portfolio of finite size.

40|$|The {{heyday of}} the {{friendly}} society movement in Australia, which spanned {{from the early days}} of colonisation until the mid- 1930 's, saw friendly societies as the main provider of social welfare benefits for {{a large proportion of the}} population. Since the advent of the modern 'welfare state', the movement drifted steadily into a state of decline. The 1980 's, however, have heralded a remarkable rejuuination of the movement, based upon traditional friendly society ideals of providence and thrift. Instigating this revival are Victoria's friendly societies which now market an array of <b>endowment</b> type life <b>assurance</b> policies, designed to promote savings and investment returns for the movement's now diverse and rapidly growing membership. All Commonwealth insurance legislation specifically excludes insurances effected by friendly societies, and from a casual reading of the Victorian Friendly Societies Act 1958, the legislative power for societies to effect life assurances is y no means immediately apparent. Indeed, a closer reading of nineteenth this Act highlights that its / century English based provisions are inadequate, and often unintelligible so far as regulating and providing a satisfactory framework for the operation of modern friendly society life assurance activities. This paper provides a practical description of friendly society <b>endowment</b> <b>assurances,</b> and examines their legal nature and operation by tracing the legislative evolution of the enabling provision. The regulation and operation of these assurances within the scope of the Friendly Societies Act, is discussed at length, and where appropriate, critically analysed. Throughout the paper comparisons between Commonwealth life insurance legislation, which regulates similar assurances, is made with a view to further highlight the inadequacies of the present friendly society legislation. By design, Part 1 is very much descriptive in its content. This is due not only to the fact that modern friendly society life assurances have received little, or no legal comment, but also because a basic understanding of the nature and operation of these assurances is a prerequisite to the discussion of their taxation implications in Part 2. In Part 2, the paper essentially focuses on the taxation consequences of ownership of a friendly society life assurance policy. It does this by looking at the long standing traditional tax concessions applicable to these policies. These take the form of 'tax-free' reversionary bonuses attaching to life assurance policies generally, and until recently, a rebate for contributions. The discussion analyses in detail, recent legislative changes, which coincidental with the dramatic increase in friendly society assurance activities, have been introduced to prevent exploitation of these traditional taxation concessions. Brief attention is also given to the taxation status of the friendly societies themselves. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} actuarial {{justification}} for equal or unequal sharing of premiums and benefits between policyholders in a product involving joint lives. The analysis reveals {{a fundamental difference}} between <b>endowment</b> and <b>assurance</b> types of products in this regard. In assurance plans, {{there is a clear}} basis for differential structure in terms of sharing premium payment. In pure endowment plans, the default system of equal premium for equal benefit may be more justified although implications of other alternatives are also considered. A justification is derived for such an alternative through appropriate discount figures as compared to individual live policies. We also suggest an alternative actuarial principle to deal with joint endowment plans: solutions have been worked out under this framework. While lives are considered to be independent for a major part of this work, the implications of dependency have also been presented here with special reference to common shock model and copula models. ...|$|R
40|$|What is quality assurance? What is {{the purpose}} of higher {{education}} and how does it affect the way quality assurance is carried out? What value can be placed on quality assurance and could it enhance a student’s learning outcome? This research takes a reflective and critical look at these questions amidst the disparagement of quality assurance and problems issuing from practice. Aside from definitional issues, quality assurance has not fulfilled its expected purpose, which for all intents hinges on compliance and improvement. It is hoped that understanding the prevailing interpretation of quality assurance by regulators, a better grasp of the controverted issues could emerge and a renewed understanding of the meaning of quality assurance stimulated. Using the methods of in-depth interview and analysing relevant documents, this thesis explored the extent to which quality assurance agents in Nigeria and South Africa engage with the epistemological basis of quality assurance. I highlighted deficiencies that offer compelling arguments for reforming the mechanism. I employed an emic and etic perspective and an interpretist approach underpinned by hermeneutics. Diametrically opposed to the essential nature of quality assurance are the external control of quality assurance and the mistaken view that quality assurance is the preserve of a particular group. Also dysfunctional is the <b>endowment</b> of quality <b>assurance</b> with attributes from industry such as appropriating the concepts of quality control and auditability. Where accountability dominates, emphasis on improvement is not given equal priority. Besides, focussing on compliance yields compliant sinners causing unethical behaviour and declining standards to be prevalent in universities and among students. Nonetheless, quality assurance is valued and has brought some improvement albeit extracted under duress. The internalisation of the essential nature of quality assurance, and not just quality as a seven –letter word or it misrepresentation as minimum standard, requires a more strategic approach. My original contribution to knowledge is the proposal of a mechanism for quality assurance, which is neither prescriptive nor presuming upon a political mandate. Embodying the scope of what quality assurance should entail, this mechanism crystallises the internalisation of quality assurance. It provides some clarification for quality assurance and offers a proposition for future research...|$|R
40|$|In December 2010 the Treasury Department {{presented}} a proposal contain-ing change in regard of current <b>endowment</b> <b>assurance</b> laws and an alterna-tive way of saving financial instruments called Investment Savings Account. The {{purpose of the}} proposal is to make investing in financial instruments easier for private investors and to prevent reigning tax evasion regarding endowment assurances. The objective of this thesis is {{to determine if the}} proposal will have the desired effect of making investments in financial in-struments easier for private investors. The purpose is also to determine whether the changes imposed by the proposal are relevant and adequate. The proposal suggests that the Investment Savings Account should be sub-jected to flat-rate tax instead of taxation on capital profit upon divestment of financial instruments, which is the case today. By doing this the investor does not have to calculate expenditure costs of investments making declar-ing tax return to the Tax Agency easier. The proposal also includes change regarding <b>endowment</b> <b>assurance</b> laws stating that deposits and withdrawals should affect the capital base of the assurance preventing tax evasion. Fur-thermore the proposal suggests an elevation of tax on endowment assur-ances conform to the tax-rate of the Investment Savings Account. The proposal shows good intentions since the Treasury Department has ac-knowledged that {{something has to be done}} concerning taxation on capital. However, the execution is in some areas quite poor. Excessive measures are taken in comparison to what is achieved. Calculations are complicated, mak-ing capital profit and taxation unpredictable for private investors. Elevating taxation on endowment assurances within a Swedish tax system which is al-ready high might impede the financial market...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. To provide information on consumers' experience, knowledge and attitudes in relation to insurance policies of five different types. The types of policy covered are: 1. Life assurance policies 2. <b>Endowment</b> <b>assurance</b> policies 3. Home insurance (buildings) (Householders survey only) 4. Home insurance (contents) (Householders survey only) 5. Motor vehicle insurance Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions a) How people have taken out their present policy(ies) b) Who advised them and what advice they were given c) Policy holders' awareness of specific clauses in their policies d) Problems that have arisen when making a claim on their policy e) Other difficulties {{members of the public}} have had to face in connection with insurance f) Attitudes of non-policy holders to each type of policy {{and the way in which}} they would obtain such a policy. Survey consists of 4 separate questionnaires. Variables common to all include: whether informant holds a policy or whether he/she has ever held a policy - if applicable; reason for no longer having one is given. If respondent has never considered taking out a policy, 'reason' is stated and a record is made of how he/she would go about obtaining one should he/she so decide. Particulars of policy held: company with which policy is held; annual yearly premium on policy; method of payment (e. g. by Giro); whether paid by instalments; if so, frequency of payment is recorded; total sum assured on policy; date policy was taken out. Procedures followed when taking out policy: whether and by whom prompted to take out policy; objectives in taking out policy; decision stages involved in first taking out policy; from whom received advice (8 categories). There is a separate section on insurance brokers, where applicable. Knowledge of policy: particularly, cover of policy; facilities linked with policy (e. g. life insurance policy and mortgage facility); amount which would be received if respondent stopped paying premiums before policy maturation date. Also, familiarity with policy document is tested (e. g. the last time that holder read or even looked at the document, and where it is normally kept). Claims (except in life insurance questionnaire) : number of claims made on policy; value of claim; whether handled by self; circumstances leading to claim; difficulties experienced; eventual outcome (e. g. claim met in full) and knowledge of the term 'averaging' on claims. Attitudes: circumstances in which respondent might decide to increase the value of his/her policy; whether he/she has ever contacted the insurance company with a view to modifying policy (if yes, who contacted and number of times is recorded); whether respondent thinks that the company should contact policy holders from time to time or whether it should be left to the holder to contact the company. Satisfaction with people who may have been contacted at some stage in connection with policy is gauged on a 7 -point scale (people listed are: insurance broker; insurance agent; bank manager; solicitor; other professional adviser). Background Variables Sex, age cohort, marital status, occupational details (including industry, job description and status, qualifications obtained), social grade, household status (i. e. sex, ages, number, occupational status, marital status, relationship to informant), home tenure and area of residence...|$|E
