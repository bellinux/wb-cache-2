It took off from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>process</b> (FT) synthetic fuel and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines.

Public policies have been proposed involving diversification of the power matrix with an increasing share for Non-conventional Renewable Energies (NCRE) from unconventional resources in the medium- and long-term. In this framework, new funding strategies are fundamental to encourage applied research in this field. Main research subjects are considered: survey, quantification and characterization of raw materials, introduction of energy crops and studies focused on transportation, management and conversion of lignocellulose for the second-generation biofuel industry. A recent regulatory framework allows the substitution of 2 or 5 % of gasoline and diesel by ethanol and biodiesel, respectively; however, this is not mandatory because biofuel supply is still non-secured. On the other hand, the scenario for private initiatives focused on first-generation biofuels is not promising, and this may continue in time depending {{on the price of}} imported biofuels and local production costs.

These reactions are commonly performed in slurry bubble columns, i. e. three-phase gas-liquid-solid reactors.

The influence of the main operating conditions, such as oxygen-to-diesel molar ratio and the H 2 O and/or CO 2 feed into the system, was analysed in both steam and dry CLR processes.

40|$|This work investigates one {{biochemical}} and one thermochemical biomass-to-liquid biofuel conversion pathway {{in terms}} of lignocellulose conversion to liquid Fischer-Tropsch diesel. The {{focus has been on}} comparing the two conversion pathways {{in terms of}} identifying their energy flows and respective feed to fuel ratios. The conversion pathways investigated comprise two-stage conversion sequences including biomass-to-gas conversion and gas-to-liquid conversion, exerted by anaerobic digestion or gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A systematic documentation of available technologies regarding the two conversion pathways is performed by literature study. The pathways are modeled in Aspen Plus supplied with FORTRAN declarations. Mass flows and composition for the two pathways are collected from simulations and energy flows are identified by heating value and energy balance calculations. The energy flows are presented graphically and by ESankey-diagrams, and the resulting energy utilities and feed to fuel ratios are presented graphically and in tabular form. The key finding is that for the application to <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>processes,</b> the biochemical conversion pathway is less energy effective in terms of gas-to-liquid conversion.

The reactor is one aspect of this process and is the focus of this research. A microchannel reactor has been constructed and the performance compared against a more traditional fixed bed reactor.

The reactor was washcoated with unsupported cobalt, cobalt on titania, and a combustion synthesis cobalt deposition method. Comparison was made to a simple cobalt on titania catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. The catalysts were compared at 210, 225 and 240 °C. The simple unsupported cobalt washcoat catalyst had slightly higher productivity per unit catalyst of all catalysts tested in the microchannel reactor and was 32 to 40 times more effective than the fixed bed reactor over the temperature range tested and also more effective than similar catalyst in a batch slurry reactor.

Synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a H2:CO ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2. This ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview {{of the state of the}} art of first and second generation biofuel production pathways. Information is provided on primary feedstocks, typical feedstock yields, available conversion technologies, biofuel production costs and market opportunities. In this report, a pathway element is considered first generation if it is deployed at commercial scale. Thus corn, sugarcane, oil palm, and soya are first generation feedstocks, whereas jatropha is a second generation feedstock. Conversion technologies are similarly divided into first and second generation according to their level of deployment. Preferred feedstock production systems depend on country or regional circumstances. Factors such as climate and soils, marketing opportunities, traditional crop and land uses, and local production costs determine preferred biofuel production pathways. Currently the primary feedstocks for ethanol are corn and sugarcane, whereas soya, rapeseed and oil palm are the primary feedstocks used for biodiesel production. The easiest and lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) production path to ethanol is fermentation of sugarcane. Converting corn or similar starches into ethanol is more complex, because the raw material has to be converted to sugar prior fermentation. These pathways also tend to result in higher GHG emissions. Conversion of plant oils to biodiesel is primarily done via transesterification. Conversion of lignocellulosic materials (woodchips, straw, algae etc.) to ethanol or biodiesel requires second generation conversion technologies. Thermochemical processes can be used to convert these feedstocks into biodiesel (e. g., via <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>processes),</b> or enzymatic hydrolysis can be used to produce bioethanol. Currently ethanol from sugarcane is the only biofuel that is cost-competitive with fossil-based transportation fuels. Both biodiesel via transesterification and biofuels produced via second generation conversion processes have high production costs and need subsidies or higher fossil fuel prices to be competitive. Although export of biofuels could be a source of income for developing countries, trade in biofuels is expected to remain a small fraction of total biofuel production...|$|R
