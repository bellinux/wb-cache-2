50|$|An {{exceptionally}} well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine {{church of the}} Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics {{of the time in}} Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaic</b> floor.|$|E

50|$|Tell Umm el-'Amr (also {{known as}} Saint Hilarion Monastery) {{is an ancient}} Christian monastery 15 {{kilometers}} south of Gaza in the Palestinian territories. Its archaeological remains span more than four centuries, from the Roman Empire to the Umayyad period, and are characterized by five successive churches, bath and sanctuary complexes, <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaics,</b> and an expansive crypt. The site's oldest building, dating to the fourth century, is named for Hilarion, {{a native of the}} Gaza region and the father of Palestinian monasticism. The site was abandoned after a seventh-century earthquake and rediscovered by local archaeologists in 1999.|$|R

5000|$|The Saadian Tombs (...) {{were built}} in the 16th century as a {{mausoleum}} to bury many Saadian rulers and entertainers. It was lost for many years until the French rediscovered it in 1917 using aerial photographs. The mausoleum comprises the corpses of about sixty members of the Saadi Dynasty that originated in the valley of the Draa River. Among the graves are those of Ahmad al-Mansur and his family. The building is composed of three rooms, of which the best known is the room with the twelve columns. This room contains the grave of the son of the sultan's son Ahmad al-Mansur. Architecturally it represents Islamic architecture, with floral motifs, calligraphy and <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaic</b> tiles (zellij) and carrara marble, and the stele is in finely worked cedar wood and stucco work. Outside the building is a garden and the graves of soldiers and servants.|$|E
5000|$|A {{statue of}} Minerva {{and one of}} Juno's marble were found. An triumphal arch is {{destroyed}} but the façade is partly conserved. It was excavated in 1912 and dated between 185 and 191. There is a second temple (dedicated to an unknown ten) on the other side, which only remains the podium and some Corinthian architectural elements; For an inscription it seems dated 145. In the northeast corner there is a complex of buildings including {{a house with a}} peristyle of 16 columns and <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaics</b> on the four porticos; Other mosaics are in the Bardo Museum.

5000|$|The first {{farmhouse}} {{was constructed}} in the late 1st century, located downhill from where there had previously been an Iron-Age settlement. In the 2nd century a temple or mausoleum was constructed on the hilltop. Around 170 AD the farmstead was destroyed by fire, but by the late 3rd century it {{had been replaced by}} a larger house. In the 4th century major renovations were undertaken. <b>Geometric</b> <b>mosaics</b> were added to many rooms and the main bath-suite was rebuilt and enlarged. [...] In front of the villa a formal garden was laid out together with an ornamental fish-pond. On the top of the hill, the mausoleum was demolished and a circular shrine was built nearby.|$|R

Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features. The church floor was later replaced with rough opus sectile (probably by the Crusaders). In 1995-99 two large Byzantine churches were discovered in Khirbet Yattir (ancient Iethira) {{in the southern part of}} the Judean Desert. They belonged to monastic communities and were paved with beautiful mosaics in the 6-7th centuries. Two phases can be distinguished in the mosaic floor of Church C. The earlier was decorated with four birds and medallions of vines while the later one was divided into 23 strips which contain magical symbols and holy names. The dedicatory inscription dates this mosaic to the year 631/32.|$|E
50|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Jerusalem in the Monastery of the Cross {{a section of the}} elaborate 5th century mosaic floor survived, incorporating pictures of peacocks, plants and geometric patterns. Early Byzantine mosaics were preserved in the Church of John the Baptist in Ein Kerem, the Beit Jimal Monastery (in the 5th century the Church of the Tomb of St. Stephen, mosaics discovered in 1916), the Church of the Seat of Mary (Kathisma) (from the 5-8th centuries, floral and geometric designs, cornucopiae, discovered in 1992-7) and the lower church at Shepherds' Field (or Beit Sahour, the Greek Orthodox site, a floor including crosses, and therefore must predate 427). An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaic</b> floor. In 2003 during the construction works of the Israeli West Bank barrier in Abu Dis workers damaged the remains of a Byzantine monastery which was subsequently excavated. The monastery church had an elaborate mosaic floor decorated with images of animals including a deer and an octopus.|$|E
5000|$|Jerusalem {{with its}} many holy places {{probably}} {{had the highest}} concentration of mosaic-covered churches but {{very few of them}} survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called [...] "Armenian Mosaic" [...] which was discovered in 1894 near the Damascus Gate. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: [...] "For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows." [...] The symbolism of the mosaic indicates that the room was used to remember the dead as a mortuary chapel. In the Dominus Flevit Church on Mount Olives a 7th-century Byzantine chapel was unearthed in 1955. The floor is richly decorated with intersecting circles and pictures of fruit, leaves, flowers, and fish. A Greek inscription mentions Simon, who [...] "decorated this place of prayer in honor of Jesus". In the nearby Church of the Agony (built originally in the last decades of the 4th century) a colorful mosaic floor was discovered in 1920 which follows a geometric design. Fragments of a similar <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaic</b> floor were preserved in the Basilica of St. Stephen (outside the Damascus Gate) which was built by Empress Aelia Eudocia {{in the first half of}} the 5th century.|$|E
50|$|At {{one end of}} the {{pilaster}} is {{a sculpture}} of Vamana shown with eight arms (Ashtabhuja); this is decorated with various types of weapons. A crescent moon is crafted above his face and the crown of Vishnu decorates his head. He is flanked by Varaha and two other figures; below on his right is his attendant Garuda. The images in front of Vamana are three figures of Bali and his wife with Shukra, his councillor. Reliefs stand 4 m tall. Some aspects of the culture and clothing in the 6th century is visible in the art sculpted in this cave. The roof of the verandah has seven panels created by cross beams; each is painted in circular compartments with images of deities including Shiva, Vishnu, Indra, Brahma and Kama, with smaller images of Dikpalas (cardinal guardians) with <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaics</b> filling the gaps at the corners.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the villa lie in the Hall grounds about 500 yards (450m) {{southeast}} of the Hall and were excavated in 1859. A courtyard of ca.230 by 240 feet contained the main buildings. The main block {{on the north side}} had hypocausts and fine <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaics</b> with two other wings and a bath block. Slate from Collyweston was used for the roofs. Pottery found included terra sigillata and Castor ware. Coins located the main period of use as the 4th century AD. There was a well in the centre of the courtyard. Two small un-inscribed house-altars were found. One coin of Septimius Severus, the remainder Constantinian (?), possibly indicating the date of the main phase of the villa. In successive phases of building there appears to have been at least one aisled building in the same position relative to a winged corridor house at Ickleton. The villa combines a dwelling house with an aisled house.|$|R

40|$|Between {{the fourth}} and the seventh centuries CE, Christian patrons erected {{thousands}} of churches, chapels, and monasteries in cities and villages across the Mediterranean, decorating the apses, walls and floors {{of many of these}} structures with figural and <b>geometric</b> <b>mosaics.</b> These late antique Christian mosaics have been studied for their iconography, their Graeco-Roman components, and as evidence for the religious beliefs of newly-Christian patrons. However, art historians largely have ignored the ways that texts, inscribed within the visual field and composed of the same mosaic material, functioned as images in Christian spaces. For the first time, this thesis assembles the foundations of a comprehensive catalogue of early Christian mosaic inscriptions, places them back into the physical spaces in which they were meant to be read, and analyzes how these texts functioned both verbally and visually for the late antique reader/viewer, against the backdrop of Graeco-Roman traditions. I first examine the ekphrastic components of Christian inscriptions and look more closely at the different ways in which texts work with and against images and spaces, encouraging the viewer to react physically and mentally. Second, I study the language of light used by the inscriptions, and argue that this language linked text to the material of mosaic and enabled patrons to make complex statements about their cultural erudition and religious affiliation. Third, I investigate the functions and visual forms of short tituli which label scenes or name figures to simplify, authenticate or transform static images into narratives in motion. Finally, I turn to the frames of the inscriptions and contend that different forms conveyed powerful visual arguments. By writing these texts back into their mosaics, this thesis argues that texts and images were inseparable in the period, and that text written into images performed and played in more complex ways than has been previously thought.

40|$|When {{covering}} {{an extensive}} area {{by means of}} geocoded airborne or satellite imagery {{there is a need}} to combine a fairly large number of single images into a big, seamless mosaic. To accomplish this objective, all photo shots must be radiometrically compensated after geocoding to get a continuous, homogeneous result. Then, seam lines that define the contribution of each photo to the final mosaic are found. The final orthoimage can be evaluated in terms of geometric quality paying attention to several kinds of common artifacts. Two of them will be considered here: stretched areas and geometric shadows. Stretched areas-where ground sampling distance is worse than nominal due to observation geometry- can usually be avoided in the <b>mosaic</b> process. <b>Geometric</b> shadows, however, need a post-processing step on the final orthoimages in order to be properly eliminated. This automatic algorithm to obtain a high <b>geometric</b> quality <b>mosaic</b> is a key issue towards a generic procedure for true-ortho generation. 1...|$|R
50|$|Albingaunum was {{the main}} Roman port of Liguria. The {{octagonal}} baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. Massilia remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building {{of its kind in}} Western Europe, had a <b>geometric</b> floor <b>mosaic</b> which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest.
