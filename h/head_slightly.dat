5|$|The ant {{who lost}} the ritual fight will lower its body, and lean {{sideways}} from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either {{one or both of}} the ants would kick outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E
25|$|Withers: {{the highest}} point of the {{thoracic}} vertebrae, the point just above {{the tops of the}} shoulder blades, seen best with horse standing square and <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> lowered; the height of the horse is measured at the withers.|$|E
25|$|Trapping in a pit depends {{largely on}} the terrain and {{availability}} of grass to cover it; pits are dug out {{in such a way}} that a fallen animal has little room to manoeuvre with its <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> above the pit, so that it is easy to saw off the horn.|$|E

25|$|To the ready/Standing by/Rest/Relax: {{the command}} tells the band {{to stand with}} <b>heads</b> <b>slightly</b> bowed, feet {{shoulder}} length apart. The band often automatically does this when they first march onto a field {{at the beginning of}} their show.|$|R
50|$|Highway 9 {{begins at}} US 67 in Malvern and heads south through Lono, Tulip, and Princeton before <b>heading</b> <b>slightly</b> west. The route then passes through Holly Springs and past {{numerous}} quarries before terminating at US 79 at Eagle Mills.|$|R
25|$|A. duodenale worms are grayish {{white or}} pinkish with the <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> bent in {{relation}} {{to the rest of the}} body. This bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named. They possess well-developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. While males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeters, the females are often longer and stouter. Additionally, males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa.|$|E
25|$|The loon, {{the size}} of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks and geese but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of ducks and geese – are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to the bulky body. The bird points its <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} I was {{entitled}} to the shot, though as the bird <b>headed</b> <b>slightly</b> toward me there was some doubt about the matter. Allinson gave me the full benefit, though I think {{he must have known}} that I would miss." ...|$|R
50|$|The A7 {{is fully}} {{motorway}} and is relatively devoid of either traffic jams or, indeed, traffic at all. The A7 leaves Winterthur at the Attikon interchange, <b>heading</b> <b>slightly</b> north before turning northeast and continuing onto {{the capital of}} the canton of Thurgau, Frauenfeld.|$|R
25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed and his <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> lowered as he skates {{from right to}} left, Grant dominates the canvas. The {{dramatic}} impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{has a large}} <b>head,</b> <b>slightly</b> convex profile, and a long, {{well-muscled}} neck. The withers are well-muscled, {{which often}} makes them less pronounced, the chest is broad and deep, the shoulders are muscular and sloping, and the croup slightly sloping. The legs are short {{in relation to the}} body, but strong and well-muscled. The legs have little or no feather, as the breed was developed partially for working in the heavy clay soils of its native country, where heavy feather led to increased disease prevalence. They are hardy and long-lived horses, and docile in temperament. In the early 20th century, when a breed standard was issued by the British Cleveland Bay Society for use in judging shows, a section was added on the movement of the horses, describing the desired action, especially at the trot. [...] This was included in part because military potential was still considered a factor in evaluating harness horses and a good trot was necessary for an artillery horse. It was also evaluated because breeds with large action at the trot often also have a potential for jumping. The combination of desired characteristics means that the breed is useful for breeding show jumpers, eventers and steeplechasers (the latter especially when crossed with Thoroughbreds).|$|E
500|$|MacLaren's {{obituary}} in The Times {{stated that}} he was [...] "one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time". As a batsman, he {{had a reputation for}} stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with his <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his drives. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from good length balls. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches. One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook. In later years, Cardus described the shot: [...] "To see MacLaren hook a fast ball... from the front of his face, was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn't merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence." [...] Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren [...] "The Noblest Roman", and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: [...] "If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus." [...] MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in the outfield but later at slip.|$|E

2500|$|In 15th century Florence, cappucci were {{associated}} with republicans, as opposed to courtiers (see gallery). An advisor to the Medici told them in 1516 that they should get as many young men to wear [...] "the courtier's cap" [...] rather than the cappucci. [...] Part of the connotation seems to arise because the chaperon was too complicated to be taken off on meeting one of higher rank (in Florence at any rate); it was merely touched or pushed back on the <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} of the aerodynamic center {{of pressure on the}} sails to the hydrodynamic center of pressure (referred to as the center of lateral resistance) on the hull determines the behavior of the boat in the wind. [...] This behavior is known as the [...] "helm" [...] and is either a weather helm or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both {{from the standpoint of the}} [...] "feel" [...] of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.|$|E

2500|$|Wallis was keen to {{join the}} RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a {{defective}} right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried {{to join the}} RAF again, {{this time with the}} newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, [...] "I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up and asked me to read the bottom line with my bad eye, without them realising I just turned my <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> so I could again see with my good eye – I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!" ...|$|E

60|$|There the daffodils were lifting {{their heads}} and {{throwing}} back their yellow curls. At the foot of each sloping, grey old tree stood a family of flowers, some bursten with golden fulness, some lifting their <b>heads</b> <b>slightly,</b> to show a modest, sweet countenance, others still hiding their faces, leaning forward pensively from the jaunty grey-green spears; I wished I had their language, {{to talk to them}} distinctly.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the tape, {{the drive}} {{reversed}} the direction of tape motion, moved the read and write <b>heads</b> <b>slightly</b> vertically across the tape, and continued to write (or read) more data until the beginning of the tape was reached. This process could be repeated many times, laying down several track sets on the tape media in a serpentine recording mode. The Storage Tek 9840, 9940 and T10000 drives are all serpentine recording drives.|$|R
50|$|The {{second stage}} was another {{opportunity}} for the sprinters. After the start in Tarnowskie Góry, the riders headed south-east, passing through the intermediate sprints in Piekary Śląskie, Chorzów and Siemianowice Śląskie, following devious roads before hitting the 17 km finishing circuit in Katowice. It contained the two category four climbs of the day, and the final metres before the finish line <b>headed</b> <b>slightly</b> downhill, with speeds of about 80 km/h expected from the top riders.|$|R
