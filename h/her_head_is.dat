5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{level with}} the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> not looking. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> buried {{upon his}} shoulder. Arnold was puzzled.|$|R
60|$|But {{all that}} night long she never slept. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{too full of}} Bertram Ingledew.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> on his shoulder. She {{wanted to}} speak, {{but could not}} without loosing the flood of tears.|$|R
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
25|$|The woman’s head {{is large}} in scale, {{with a broad}} face and wide cheeks. She has a long {{straight}} neck, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> slightly turned to the left side, creating a three-quarters portrait.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> thrown back, <b>her</b> {{lips were}} parted. She drank {{in the breeze}} {{as though it were}} wine.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> turned. I {{drew the}} poor soul's {{attention}} compassionately to what I had {{said a moment}} since.|$|R
60|$|She {{sank down}} into the seat under the cedar tree. Her hands were clasped nervously together, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> downcast.|$|R
25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> gently leaning to her right, {{her eyes are}} half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E
25|$|This statue is {{the least}} well-preserved of the statues found in the Piraeus cache; the bronze has crumbled slightly, and other {{sections}} have separated completely. The right side of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> also slightly disfigured due to swelling.|$|E
25|$|The lid was a {{hammered}} bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg {{and shaped}} {{to fit the}} krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it {{also served as a}} strainer for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object. She wears a peplos, the body-length Ancient Greek garment worn by women, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures {{on the rest of the}} vessel.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> buried {{upon his}} shoulder, {{and she was}} not in the {{position}} for a moment to make any reply.|$|R
60|$|When {{she came}} out fully dressed she looked tired and pale, but <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> high and <b>her</b> manner proudly self-contained.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{would be}} a better song if <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>were</b> turned the other way--to the Ushant light, for instance,' said the Nilghai.|$|R
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> framed by pine boughs. She stares off to the right, her gaze following her outstretched right arm. Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E
25|$|Picasso drew each of {{the figures}} in Les Demoiselles differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is {{rendered}} with heavy paint. Composed of sharp geometric shapes, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> the most strictly Cubist of all five. The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state. She also {{seems to have been}} drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost as if in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E
60|$|She {{dared not}} look back at <b>her</b> rescuer. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> bent, and <b>her</b> lips were murmuring half-audible words as she went.|$|R
60|$|Side by side {{they stood}} {{looking over the}} ocean. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> thrown back, <b>her</b> lips a little parted. He watched her curiously.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{she forced}} her great bulk, inch by inch, through the opening. Now <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> through, now one great forearm and shoulder.|$|R
500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other." ...|$|E
500|$|At 31cm × 14cm, the painting's {{dimensions}} are {{small enough to}} be almost considered miniature, consistent with most 15th-century devotional diptychs. A reduced size increased portability and affordability, and encouraged the viewer to approach the piece to more closely see its intricate details. [...] The work shows Mary wearing a dark blue robe – the colour traditionally used to emphasise her humanity – over a red dress of different textured fabrics. Her hem is embroidered in gold with gilded lettering that reads [...] "SOL" [...] and [...] "LU", or perhaps SIOR SOLE HEC ES, in all probability, fragments of the Latin words for [...] "sun" [...] (sole) and [...] "light" [...] (lux). On <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> an elaborately tiered and jeweled crown and in her arms she carries the infant Jesus, his feet resting on her left hand. Swaddled in a white cloth from hips trailing down beyond his feet, his hand rests on her neckline clutching the jeweled hem of his mother's dress.|$|E
500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to just push it a little further than normal. Something as simple as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] just a little bit longer than normal. Really squashing her when she lands. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> tucking in. Everything is supporting this basic principle of squash and stretch in a gameplay asset." ...|$|E
60|$|The brim of her linen hat {{kept the}} sun from her face, but <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{drooping}} like a flower's head at noon.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{stood for}} some time as it had left her, except that <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> bent and <b>her</b> eyes downcast in thought.|$|R

500|$|When {{receptive}} to mating, a female {{blacktip reef shark}} swims slowly in a [...] pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them. Once the male finds her, he closes to around [...] and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent. A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins; these mating wounds heal completely after 4–6 weeks. After a period of synchronous swimming, the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> against the bottom and her tail is raised. Once the female is in position, the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for several minutes, after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior. Off Moorea, individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year, often to within a week's precision, whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing. Younger females {{are also more likely}} to fail to become pregnant after mating.|$|E
500|$|All three {{denominations}} of the Barber coinage {{depict a}} head of Liberty, facing right. She wears a pileus, a crown fashioned from an olive branch, and a small headband inscribed [...] "Liberty". On the quarter and half dollar, the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] appears above her head; she is otherwise surrounded with 13 six-pointed stars and the date. On the dime, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> surrounded with [...] "United States of America" [...] and the year. The reverse of the quarter and half dollar depicts a heraldic eagle, based on the Great Seal. The bird holds in its mouth a scroll inscribed [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] and in its right claws an olive branch; in its left it holds 13 arrows. Above the eagle are 13 five-pointed stars; it is surrounded {{by the name of}} the country and by the coin's denomination. The reverse of the dime depicts a wreath of corn, wheat, maple and oak leaves surrounding the words [...] "One Dime". Barber's monogram [...] "B" [...] is on the cutoff of Liberty's neck; the mint mark, on the dime, is placed beneath the wreath on the reverse and beneath the eagle on the larger denominations.|$|E
500|$|Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the {{personification}} of the [...] "Ecclesia Triumphans" [...] and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found {{in a number of}} other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a [...] "throne room", which envelopes her as if a [...] "carrying case". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as [...] "the Madonna in a church", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary [...] "as the Church". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{smile on}} her face, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> thrown back. She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a quarter}} of an hour, however, before the {{position}} of the cutter was seen to change. Then <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> suddenly turned east.|$|R
60|$|The turban <b>was</b> gone, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{covered in}} the fashion of native women, with a long cotton cloth of a deep red colour.|$|R
