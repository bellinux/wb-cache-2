50|$|Although the {{external}} furnace {{area of the}} kiln has at some stage been dismantled and filled in, it can be located {{on the eastern side}} where ground subsidence reveals a round <b>flue</b> <b>outlet.</b> This is 1.5m from the northern edge of the building with 4.18m between the top of the brick wall and the top of the outlet. The diameter of the outlet is approximately 30 cm. The corrugated roof sheeting at the centre of the eastern wall has been cut back in two places and the metal in between bent down, indicating the former position of the chimney. A flat piece of iron attached to the left of this is probably the remains of a holding bracket for the chimney. Looking inside through the broken bricks on the western wall, it is possible to see a second matching <b>flue</b> <b>outlet</b> at a corresponding distance from the southern edge of the building. At a lower level, between these round outlets and the northern and southern walls, are two square holes indicating the flue inlets. Although no longer attached to the inlets and outlets, the remains of two iron flues still lie on the dirt floor, running across the barn and back again. They appear to be made out of iron sheeting fashioned into round pipes with telescopic sleeves joined together to form the returns. Some remnants of timber tiers are also evident, mainly along the northern wall. These tiers are made of bush saplings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Hungary, the prevalently used “B 11 ” type gas {{appliances}} equipped with atmospheric burner {{and they have}} a draught hood beyond the outlet of the appliance. For the appropriate adjustment of the gas boiler to the conditions of the building, computer-generated calculation results have to be obtained which can help the positioning of the appliance and the air supply outlets in the room in which the appliance is installed. Chimneys of natural draught are very sensitive to the changes in the amount of combustion air due to inside or outside ambient phenomena or forced effects. For the purposes of modelling, a numerical simulation (CFD method) can be used. The aim of numeric modelling is to investigate velocity and temperature conditions around the <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> and in the room and, subsequently, to define design approaches and the requirements for different conditions.

40|$|The present paper {{outlines}} {{measures for}} the refurbishment of the Greek lignite-fired power plant Kardia and discusses {{their impact on}} the efficiency, the electricity generation costs and the operation of the plant. The power plants Kardia III and IV with an installed capacity of 300 MWel each were constructed in the late 70 ies in Northern Greece and still operate as base load units for the Public Power Corporation (PPC) of Greece. Several problems are detected during the operation of these two units concerning high <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> temperature - and consequently low boiler efficiency -, poor electrostatic precipitator performance, high slagging tendency, fluctuating temperature field resulting unstable steam temperatures and a high percentage of leakage air. To improve the current situation PPC in collaboration with the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) conducted a feasibility study to set the priorities and to select the most suitable measures for the refurbishment of these two units. Taking advantage of the international experience, the possible measures applicable in the case of brown coal fired units upgrade were collected, categorized and presented to PPC's management. The proposed measures were evaluated for the specific case of Kardia and then it was decided to further examine the following actions: Sealing of the boiler in order to minimize the amount of the leakage air, extension of the economizer followed by the replacement of one bled steam feed water preheater aiming at the decrease of the <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> temperature and optimization of the soot blowers operation. For these actions and using the process simulation program ENBIPRO, the expected benefits in terms of efficiency as well as the dimensions of the necessary additional heating surface and the influence of the rearrangement of the heating surfaces in the boiler on the water/steam cycle were calculated. The costs of the suggested actions were estimated together with the time frame for their implementation. Investment plans were put together and the pay back time for each alternative was evaluated. Based on the discussed feasibility study PPC initialized a closer collaboration with a steam generator construction company in order to include the refurbishment of Kardia III and IV to its investment planning program for the coming years...|$|R
50|$|In the {{vertical}} {{form of the}} De Poray boiler, the main heating surface is composed of vertical Field tubes in this secondary combustion chamber. A steel radiation bell is hung in {{the centre of the}} chamber, beneath the <b>outlet</b> <b>flue,</b> and the combustion gases are directed to pass over this, heating it. Heating of the tubes themselves is partly by convection from the gases, partly by indirect re-radiation from this heated bell. This permits a lower operating temperature for the tubes, also a more even heating. This is claimed by the makers to encourage more uniform boiling within the tube, thus faster steam-raising.|$|R

In accordance with the international experience, {{the results of this study}} have confirmed that: - the replacement of the turbine blades and the measures for the cold end optimization have a significant effect on the efficiency improvement, - the reduction of the <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> temperature through the installation of additional heating surfaces mainly results in the performance improvement of the ESP's and additionally it has only a limited influence on the power plant efficiency, - boiler sealing measures for the reduction of the infiltration air and the soot blower measures should be realized in the short run...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter the {{combustion}} of natural gas, the flue gas contains {{large amounts of}} water vapor. The latent heat of the water vapor in the flue gas account for 10 %- 11 % of the lower heating value of natural gas, that is, if the condensing heat of the flue gas were recovered, the energy efficiency could be improved greatly. In order to improve {{the efficiency of the}} space heating system by natural gas, the potential of waste heat of the flue gas were analyzed, and the problems of the conventional space heating system were proposed.

40|$|A unique {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate flue gas-side fouling and cleaning performance characteristics of a heat exchanger tube bundle for application in coal-fired environments. The test bundle contained helically finned tubes in a staggered arrangement. Air sootblowers were installed upstream and downstream of the test bundle to evaluate cleaning effectiveness during the fouling test. The bundle was installed in the <b>outlet</b> <b>flue</b> of a coal-fired test boiler to simulate flue gas and friable flyash conditions of a pulverized-coal-fired utility or industrial boiler. Thermal and hydraulic performance characteristics were measured {{to determine the effects}} of fouling and sootblower cleaning on bundle heat transfer and pressure drop. Results showed that ash deposits were controllable by sootblowing and that the bundle did not plug. The maximum fouling factor depended on sootblowing frequency, and there was no measurable increase in bundle pressure drop. Fouling-factor data were correlated against time, bundle geometry, and flue gas conditions for the two coals tested.

40|$|Abstract:––The major {{efficiency}} {{loss of a}} boiler {{is caused by the}} hot stack gases discharging to the atmosphere which is polluting the atmosphere and on other side Pollution Control Board is forcing the norms of Pollution levels in atmosphere. One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. Typically, on a high pressure water tube boiler, the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4 %, depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler, the improvement is 2 to 3. 5 %, depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. A feedwater line, which serves the boiler, is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are some bank of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another bank of tubes in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler, and to find how much feed water temperature raises both from subcritical and Supercritical operating conditions. An investigation is conducted on the effect of performance of the boiler by incorporating the additional bank of tubes in the space below the lower bank of tubes. The main idea is to extract maximum amount of heat from the flue gases and increase the heat pick up rate of the feed water outlet into the boiler. By assuming the additional bank of tubes, various heat transfer calculations are done and the reduction in the <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> temperature and increase in the feedwater outlet temperature are found out. Finally a comparison o...|$|R
40|$|In EfW (Energy from Waste) boilers, flue gases {{can create}} {{corrosion}} of the superheaters and economisers, caused by deposits of the melted ashes. Due to this, the flue gases are cooled with water wall panels and water tube walls in a cooling pass {{before reaching the}} heat transfer surfaces, thus limiting the power output. One way {{to increase the efficiency}} of the boiler is to introduce superheater screens in the cooling zone instead of using water wall panels to cool the flue gases. This new superheater would be covered in a ceramic material to protect its tubes from the above-cited fouling. The purpose of the present work was to create a 1 D model that describes the heat transfer from the flue gases to the coolant (steam and water) in the flue gas cooling pass of a power boiler. The 1 D model, which is validated against CFD simulations using the Discrete Ordinates (DO) radiation model, will be used in the retrofit of EfW boilers. Furthermore, CFD simulations are used to study the pressure loss and mass flow distribution in the cooling pass under different situations and to provide design correlations. Also, the influence of different parameters on the computational cost of the CFD simulations is examined. The 1 D model agreed fairly well with the CFD simulation, especially in {{the lower part of the}} cooling pass. The <b>flue</b> gas <b>outlet</b> temperature was 4. 5 % lower in the 1 D model than in the CFD simulation. In the 1 D model, the geometry could be approached as rectangular canals, neglecting the inclination of the ceiling, and modelling the inlet and the outlet of the cooling pass as water tube walls. Regarding the flow field, the mass flow distribution in the cooling pass was found to be independent of factors such as the mass flow rate and the number of screens. It is sufficient to calculate the relative depths of the canals to get the mass flow distribution. The pressure loss can be found as a function of the average flue gas velocity in the cooling pass. The CFD mesh required approximately half a million cells, and the computational cost was decreased by using a symmetry plane in the middle of the cooling pass, costing just over an hour...|$|R
3000|$|Scenedesmus acutus was {{obtained}} from the University of Texas Culture Collection (UTEX B 72). A urea medium previously optimized for this Scenedesmus strain [21] was used for all experiments. Cultures were initially grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (500  mL) under warm (Philips F 32 T 8 /TL 741 Alto, 32  W) and cool white (Philips F 32 T 8 /TL 735 Alto, 32  W) fluorescent lights [70  µmol/(m 2  s)] in a 16 : 8  h light:dark illumination period. Flasks were bubbled with 3  % CO 2 (balance N 2) at room temperature (22  °C). The cultures were subsequently transferred to 7.5  L airlift photobioreactors (PBRs) located in a greenhouse and supplied with 3  % CO 2 and natural light. A number of airlift PBRs were used to seed a 1200  L cyclic flow PBR at East Bend Station. The latter was constantly monitored by probes for pH (Hach PC 1 R 2 A), dO 2 (Hach 5740 DOB), reactor and ambient temperature (J thermocouples) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, Apogee Instruments SQ- 215).

40|$|The {{effects on}} the energy {{situation}} in industry when gas fired liquid heaters replace steam have been determined by energy surveys performed in a brewery and a slaughterhouse, measurements of the performance and emissions from liquid heaters installed in these industries, and theoretical analyses of the potential energy saving. The theoretical study {{in the first part}} of the project provides information that allows assessment of the {{effects on the}} energy situation, of part or complete conversion to decentralized heating, under the conditions prevailing in the industries concerned. The second part of the project focused on increasing the liquid heater efficiency and reducing emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Heat transfer and pressure drop for a corrugated tube were investigated experimentally. Empirical correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop were developed. These correlations were used in the design model that was developed within this project. The design model was validated against experimental data and data from an industrial application, where a section of the smooth heat exchanger tube was replaced with a corrugated tube. The results show that the design model predicts the <b>outlet</b> <b>flue</b> gas temperature and the heater efficiency quite accurately. The wall temperature at the first corrugation is also predicted with reasonable accuracy. These results make it possible to calculate the location where a corrugated tube can be inserted without causing subcooled boiling or severe fouling. It is shown that emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons can be held at low levels, even when conventional industrial burners are used. The use of nozzles that produce long soft flames increases the risk for large emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{presents}} and discusses {{results from a}} mercury control process development project entitled ''Pilot Testing of Mercury Oxidation Catalysts for Upstream of Wet FGD Systems''. The objective of this project was to demonstrate at pilot scale a mercury control technology that uses solid honeycomb catalysts to promote the oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas from coal combustion. Oxidized mercury is removed in downstream wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) absorbers and leaves with the FGD byproducts. The goal {{of the project was}} to achieve 90 % oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas and 90 % overall mercury capture with the downstream wet FGD system. The project was co-funded by EPRI and the U. S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41185. Great River Energy (GRE) and City Public Service (now CPS Energy) of San Antonio were also project co-funders and provided host sites. URS Group, Inc. was the prime contractor. Longer-term pilot-scale tests were conducted at two sites to provide catalyst life data. GRE provided the first site, at their Coal Creek Station (CCS), which fires North Dakota lignite, and CPS Energy provided the second site, at their Spruce Plant, which fires Powder River Basin (PRB) coal. Mercury oxidation catalyst testing began at CCS in October 2002 and continued through the end of June 2004, representing nearly 21 months of catalyst operation. An important finding was that, even though the mercury oxidation catalyst pilot unit was installed downstream of a high-efficiency ESP, fly ash buildup began to plug flue gas flow through the horizontal catalyst cells. Sonic horns were installed in each catalyst compartment and appeared to limit fly ash buildup. A palladium-based catalyst showed initial elemental mercury oxidation percentages of 95 % across the catalyst, declining to 67 % after 21 months in service. A carbon-based catalyst began with almost 98 % elemental mercury oxidation across the catalyst, but declined to 79 % oxidation after nearly 13 months in service. The other two catalysts, an SCR-type catalyst (titanium/vanadium) and an experimental fly-ash-based catalyst, were significantly less active. The palladium-based and SCR-type catalysts were effectively regenerated {{at the end of the}} long-term test by flowing heated air through the catalyst overnight. The carbon-based catalyst was not observed to regenerate, and no regeneration tests were conducted on the fourth, fly-ash-based catalyst. Preliminary process economics were developed for the palladium and carbon-based catalysts for a scrubbed, North Dakota lignite application. As described above, the pilot-scale results showed the catalysts could not sustain 90 % or greater oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas for a period of two years. Consequently, the economics were based on performance criteria in a later DOE NETL solicitation, which required candidate mercury control technologies to achieve at least a 55 % increase in mercury capture for plants that fire lignite. These economics show that if the catalysts must be replaced every two years, the catalytic oxidation process can be 30 to 40 % less costly than conventional (not chemically treated) activated carbon injection if the plant currently sells their fly ash and would lose those sales with carbon injection. If the plant does not sell their fly ash, activated carbon injection was estimated to be slightly less costly. There was little difference in the estimated cost for palladium versus the carbon-based catalysts. If the palladium-based catalyst can be regenerated to double its life to four years, catalytic oxidation process economics are greatly improved. With regeneration, the catalytic oxidation process shows over a 50 % reduction in mercury control cost compared to conventional activated carbon injection for a case where the plant sells its fly ash. At Spruce Plant, mercury oxidation catalyst testing began in September 2003 and continued through the end of April 2005, interrupted only by a host unit outage in late February/early March 2005. With a baghouse upstream of the catalysts, sonic horns did not appear to be necessary and were never installed. Pressure drop across the four catalysts remained low. Catalyst activity for elemental mercury oxidation was difficult to evaluate at this site. It was found that the baghouse effectively oxidized elemental mercury in the flue gas, with the baghouse <b>outlet</b> <b>flue</b> gas averaging 81 % mercury oxidation. This oxidation resulted in little elemental mercury remaining in the flue gas going to the oxidation catalyst pilot unit. In many instances, catalyst outlet elemental mercury concentrations were near detection limits for the measurement methods employed, so mercury oxidation percentages across the catalyst were uncertain...|$|R
