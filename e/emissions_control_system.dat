2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance {{was on the}} decline due to another federal standard—a new <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The most notable styling feature of this generation was {{the appearance of the}} fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop with frameless door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to new regulations for Kei cars introduced for 1976, Subaru introduced the larger-engined Rex 5 in May of that year. It retained the earlier bodywork (albeit broadened by 10cm {{and with a}} lengthened bonnet for an overall length of [...] ) but got a 490cc {{version of the same}} engine. The Rex 5 (K23, K43 in the Van version) engine was still of two cylinders and an overhead cam design, and retained the SEEC-T <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Power increased from the emissions choked late 360s to [...] at 6,500rpm, while torque increased to [...] at 4,500 rpm. The AG version was dropped. The Van version received a [...] engine (at 6,000rpm) with the same torque, albeit at 500rpm lower. Van equipment levels were Standard and Super Deluxe. This version (called the Subaru 500 in the export) was short-lived, replaced by the bigger Rex 550 exactly one year after being introduced.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1973 the {{two-stroke}} {{was replaced}} by a 358cc rear-mounted, watercooled, two-cylinder, four-stroke engine called the EK21. This produced [...] at a peaky 8,000rpm and [...] of torque at 6,500rpm, and featured Subaru Exhaust Emissions Control (SEEC). The car also received a minor facelift (with a [...] "frowny" [...] rather than the smiling grille seen on the turqoise four-door in the infobox being the most obvious difference) and a new chassis code: K22. Front disc brakes were also introduced as an option at the same time. The four-stroke Rex could reach a top speed of [...] The three-door, two-seater [...] "Van" [...] (K42) arrived in February of the next year, when a five-speed version (Custom5) was also added. In September (1974), along with a minor facelift consisting of a new grille and bumpers adjusted to allow for the fitment of larger license plates, a [...] "Wagon" [...] version (K26) appeared. This received four permanent seats, but was no longer registerable as a commercial vehicle and had a considerably lower max load. At the same time, a [...] "Super L" [...] version of the Van was added. Vans and Wagons received a lower tuned engine, with [...] at 7,500rpm; but torque increased somewhat to [...] at 5,700rpm. This became the power output of the standard Rex as well for model year 1976 after the SEEC-T (Subaru Exhaust Emission Control - Thermal and Thermodynamic) <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was introduced in December 1975. Torque was down to [...] at 6,000 rpm. The equipment levels were also reshuffled, with the B-type replacing the Standard and then rising from the A via the AG and A to the AG on top. The A and AG versions received disc brakes in front, but the five-speed was no longer available.|$|E
