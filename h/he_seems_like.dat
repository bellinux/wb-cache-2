At Rotterdam he lived, {{he says in a}} letter to his steward Wheelock, at the rate of less than £200 a year, and yet had much to dispose of and spend beyond {{convenient}} living. He returned to England, much improved in health, in August 1704. Although he had received immediate benefit from his stay abroad, he was showing symptoms of consumption, and gradually became a confirmed invalid. His occupations were now almost exclusively literary, and from this time forward he was engaged in writing, completing or revising the treatises which were afterwards included in the Characteristics. He continued, however, to take a warm interest in politics, both home and foreign, and especially in the war against France, of which he was an enthusiastic supporter.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} critics. Commentators from IGN, Paste and TV Fanatic were pleased with Isaacs' performance; {{they felt that}} his performance deserved an Emmy Award. IGN Matt Fowler described Isaacs' performance as [...] "suspense"-worthy, while Paste writer Ross Bonaime thought that his acting deserved an Emmy nomination [...] "at the very least". Although he did not note that his performance was Emmy-worthy, in his [...] "A-" [...] review, Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club claimed that Isaacs' is usually the [...] "bad guy", but <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "dad". Fowler gave the episode itself a [...] "9.5 out of 10", classifying it as [...] "amazing"; the entry's story was called [...] "powerful". However, Bonaime gave the entry a [...] "8.9" [...] rating.|$|E

Everyone counter-rucks {{nowadays}} and, if anything, I was in the wrong place. He just hit me and I was unlucky. So I was surprised to see he got banned. I know we didn't cite him so I don't know why the independent commissioner did. It was just a fair ruck from a hard player. When I have met him before <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a tidy enough bloke so I'm not seeing it as anything malicious." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the season saw Oliver face public furore after he was {{involved}} in separate on-field incidents. At the half-time break of the round fourteen match against West Coast, he was hit by West Coast's Will Schofield in which Schofield was immediately reported and consequently charged by the match review panel for striking. Oliver was publicly criticised by fans for [...] "staging" [...] and [...] "diving" [...] along with former Australian Test cricketer, Damien Martyn, tweeting [...] "am I watching soccer???" [...] in relation to the incident, to which Oliver responded on Twitter [...] "hey Damien, you should just worry about that shot in 1994. #amiwatchingachoker" [...] in reference to a batting shot against South Africa in the 1994 Sydney Test match which eventually saw Australia narrowly losing to South Africa. Former Richmond player, Matthew Richardson, publicly defended Oliver amid claims he was a stager by saying [...] "unless you're the one who's received that contact, how do you really know ... <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a straight-up, honest kid". Schofield successfully appealed the original charge after arguing that while [...] "he intended to strike Oliver and hit him with his forearm to the chin, the contact was so negligible it was not sufficient for a report". Two weeks later during the round sixteen match against , Oliver confronted a Carlton supporter who was sitting in the front row of the Melbourne Cricket Ground after the supporter had yelled something at him over the fence. He was publicly condemned by former players including Leigh Matthews and Nick Dal Santo who stated players needed to ignore the crowd during matches and not confront them.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think not, ma'am," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Merrick. [...] "We {{made these}} investigations {{at the time}} we still feared he would die, so as to communicate with any friends or relatives he might have. But after he passed the crisis so well and fell asleep, the hospital people stopped worrying about him. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> any ordinary, well-to-do young fellow, and a couple of days in the hospital ought to put him upon his feet again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are so {{many ways}} in which a gentleman can be of {{assistance}} to three poor lonely women, especially when he {{is at the same time}} so friendly and so delicate as Mr. Wright. I don't know what we should have done without him, and I feel as if every one ought to know it. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a very old friend. My daughter and I quite worship him. I will not conceal from you that when I saw you coming through the grounds a short time ago without him I was very much disappointed. I hope he is not ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He never says {{anything}} about God, and you don't, {{but when he}} comes in here <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> God to me. He's so peaceful,--he makes me peaceful. I remember the minister in Madison,--he was a putty-faced man with indigestion,--and when he prayed he used to close his eyes and try to look pious, but he never fooled me. He never made me believe he knew anything about God. And don't think for a minute he'd have done what you and Miss Grower and Mr. Bentley did! He used {{to cross the street}} {{to get out of the}} way of drunken men--he wouldn't have one of them in his church. And I know of a girl he drove out of town because she had a baby and her sweetheart wouldn't marry her. He sent her to hell. Hell's here--isn't it?" ...|$|E

60|$|Turnbull's {{face had}} a sudden spasm in the sunlight, a change so {{instantaneous}} that it left no trace behind it; and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare.

6000|$|... 'Not in the least,' she replied, in her {{measured}} way. Loerke laughed, wrinkling up {{his face}} oddly. There was a thin wisp of his hair straying on his forehead, she noticed that his skin was of a clear brown colour, his hands, his wrists. And his hands <b>seemed</b> closely prehensile. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> topaz, so strangely brownish and pellucid.|$|R
6000|$|Ferris {{returned}} her look {{with one of}} comical dismay. This apparent readiness of Miss Vervain's to be taken command of, daunted him, on second thoughts. [...] "I wish you'd dismiss all my stupid talk from your mind," [...] he said. [...] "I feel as if I'd been guiltily trying to set you against a man whom I like very much and have {{no reason not to}} trust, and who thinks me so much his friend that he couldn't dream of my making any sort of trouble for him. It would break his heart, I'm afraid, if you treated him in a different way from that in which you've treated him till now. It's really touching to listen to his gratitude to you and your mother. It's only conceivable on the ground that he has never had friends before in the world. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> another man, or the same man come to life. And it isn't his fault that he's a priest. I suppose," [...] he added, with a sort of final throe, [...] "that a Venetian family wouldn't use him with the frank hospitality you've shown, not because they distrusted him at all, perhaps, but because they would be afraid of other Venetian tongues." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Mr. Tennyson, while fully {{adopting}} Wordsworth's principle {{from the}} very first, seemed by instinctive taste to have escaped the snares which had proved too subtle both for Keats and Wordsworth. Doubtless there are slight niaiseries, after the manner of both those poets, in the first editions of his earlier poems. <b>He</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>like</b> most other great artists, to have first tried imitations of various styles which already existed, before he learnt the art of incorporating them into his own, and learning from all his predecessors, without losing his own individual peculiarities. But there are descriptive passages in them also which neither Keats nor Wordsworth could have written, combining the honest sensuous observation which is common to them both, with a self-restrained simplicity which Keats did not {{live long enough to}} attain, and a stately and accurate melody, an earnest songfulness (to coin a word) which Wordsworth seldom attained, and from his inaccurate and uncertain ear, still seldomer preserved without the occurrence of a jar or a rattle, a false quantity, a false rapture, or a bathos. And above all, or rather beneath all--for we suspect that this has been throughout the very secret of Mr. Tennyson's power--there was a hush and a reverent awe, a sense of the mystery, the infinitude, the awfulness, {{as well as of the}} mere beauty of wayside things, which invested these poems as wholes with a peculiar richness, depth, and majesty of tone, beside which both Keats's and Wordsworth's methods of handling pastoral subjects looked like the colouring of Julio Romano or Watteau by the side of Correggio or Titian.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the great}} {{forests of the}} Far North lives Yowler's cousin, Tufty the Canada Lynx, also called Loup Cervier and Lucivee. He is nearly a third larger than Yowler. From the tip of each ear long tufts of black hair stand up. On each {{side of his face}} is a ruff of long hair. His tail is even shorter than Yowler's, and the tip of it is always wholly black. His general color is gray, mottled with brown. His face ruff is white with black border. Yowler's feet are large, but Tufty's are immense for his size. This is because Tufty lives where the snow lies deep for many months, and these big, broad feet enable him to travel about on the snow without {{breaking}} through. He can travel with ease where Reddy Fox, not half his size and weight, would break through at every step. Tufty's ways are much like those of his cousin, Yowler, save that he is a dweller in the deep woods. Anything he can catch is food for Tufty, but his principal food is the Northern Hare. The color of his coat blends with the shadows so that <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a living shadow himself. In summer food is plentiful, and Tufty lives well, but in winder Tufty has hard work to get enough. Rarely does he know what a full stomach means then. Like Howler he can go a surprising length of time without food and still retain his strength. At that time of year he is a great traveler. He has to be, in order to live.|$|E
