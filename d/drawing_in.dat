5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> pen and ink of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{with the}} Chicago Spire site for sale by Ireland's National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), {{interest}} resumed, <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> {{at least a}} half-dozen offers for the property. Under the involuntary bankruptcy ruling in October 2013, Shelbourne had {{until the end of}} March 2014 to obtain approval of a reorganization plan, and was considering a bid to take back control of the property, reigniting hope that the skyscraper might actually be built.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as {{he also did}} in his paintings of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures. The series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of paint {{to which he was}} more accustomed.|$|E

For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine {{could not be}} <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> the same group or in groups scheduled to be played {{on the same day}} (due to a potential clash of teams and clash of fans). Therefore, if Russia were <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group B, Ukraine had to be <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group C or D, and if Russia were <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group C or D, Ukraine had to be <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group A or B.|$|R

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as <b>drawing.</b> <b>In</b> 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E

5|$|Nevelson's first {{experience}} of art {{was at the}} age of nine at the Rockland Public Library, where she saw a plaster cast of Joan of Arc. Shortly thereafter she decided to study art, taking <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> high school, where she also served as basketball captain. She painted watercolor interiors, in which furniture appeared molecular in structure, rather like her later professional work. Female figures made frequent appearances. In school, she practiced her English, her second language, as Yiddish was spoken at home. Unhappy with her family's economic status, language differences, the religious discrimination of the community, and her school, Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York.|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E
5|$|Powerball is {{a drawing}} {{game in which}} players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins the jackpot. Jackpot amounts begin at $40 million and grow with each <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> which the jackpot is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. The jackpot is pari-mutuel, meaning that if {{multiple}} tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot.|$|E

5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{states that}} names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1–3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier {{homonyms}} and competing synonyms. This {{means that the}} name Hypochnus rubrocinctum has priority over Byssus sanguinea. The type material of H.rubrocinctum was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype. The species {{was transferred to the}} genus Cryptothecia by Swedish lichenologist Göran Thor in 1991, {{on the basis of its}} similarity with C.striata such as the thallus with radiate ridges, granular isidia, and presence of para-depsides (gyrophoric acid in C.striata and confluentic acid in C.rubrocincta).|$|E
5|$|The valleys that delimit the massif {{were used}} as {{communication}} routes by the Romans until they left around the 5thcentury AD. The region has remained of some military importance through to the mid-20thcentury. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18thcentury. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was finally climbed in 1786, marking {{the start of the}} sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> over sixmillion visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and skiing. Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.|$|E
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E

5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E
5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the edges into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered planarity, in which the given graph must be drawn {{in such a way that}} parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) are placed in the <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> a way that reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E
