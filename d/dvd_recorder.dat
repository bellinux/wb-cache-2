25|$|Transmissions may be {{recorded}} {{in many ways}} – such as via the connection of a set-top-box to an existing 'analogue' video or <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder,</b> or {{by the use of}} newer models of such recorders which have built-in digital tuners. However the most common option is by the use of set-top-boxes which incorporate a hard disk drive, and allow the recording of the digital signal directly to disk, for later replay. Recording on such boxes, known as Personal Video Recorders or PVRs, is more convenient, as programmes may be easily selected for recording from an on-screen programme guide, with no need to specify explicit start and end times for recordings, and no need to program more than one piece of equipment.|$|E

It is considered a confidential set of keys used in Restricted Authentication process of the HDCP. Restricted authentication is an AKE method for devices with limited computing resources.This method is used by copying devices of any kind (such as <b>DV</b> <b>recorders</b> or D-VHS recorders) and devicescommunicating with them for authenticating copy-one-generation and no-more-copies contents. The restricted authentication protocol employs asymmetric key management and common key cryptography and relies {{on the use of}} shared secrets and hash functions to respond to a random challenge.|$|R
50|$|Large or L-size {{cassettes}} {{are accepted}} by most standalone <b>DV</b> tape <b>recorders</b> {{and are used}} in many shoulder-mount camcorders. The L-size cassette {{can be used in}} both Sony and Panasonic equipment; nevertheless, they are often called DVCAM tapes.

5000|$|The United States {{converted}} its over-the-air television broadcasts {{to digital}} [...] "ATSC" [...] in June 2009. However {{this will have}} very limited impact in ending the need for DVD recorders to perform realtime MPEG-2 encoding or transcoding. The only setup where ATSC could conceivably eliminate MPEG-2 encoding/transcoding in a <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> would be where an antenna is hooked directly into a <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> that has an integrated ATSC tuner. Even then however, the <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> will have to transcode the ATSC MPEG-2 into DVD-Video-compliant MPEG-2 if the ATSC MPEG-2 stream isn't already DVD-Video-compatible. This would require transcoding for all high-definition broadcasts and some if not all standard-definition broadcasts. The same general situation applies to digital cable service; only DVD recorders with integrated digital cable ("QAM") tuners can possibly avoid transcoding, and then only if the digital cable system is already sending a DVD-Video-compatible MPEG-2 stream, which again requires transcoding of all HD content and some if not all SD content. All other setups (digital cable box's analog outputs to <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder,</b> satellite box's analog outputs to <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder,</b> <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> tuning and recording analog cable channels which are still permitted after 2/2009, etc.) usually always involve an analog step with MPEG-2 encoding being necessary inside the <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1985, Immink joined Philips’ {{magnetic}} recording group, where he {{contributed to the}} design of coding technologies of the digital video tape <b>recorder,</b> <b>DV</b> and the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC). The DCC was short-lived: introduced in 1992 and discontinued in 1996. The DV, launched in 1994, has become a popular tape standard for home and semi-professional video production.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} child behavior management problems (BMP) and to analyze the influence and predictive power of nondental and dental background variables on BMP. Study Design: Prospective analytical study. Materials and Methods: The study group included 165 children aged 7 - 11 years who received comprehensive dental treatment, after obtaining written informed consent. Parents/guardians were interviewed using standardized questionnaire to obtain background information. Each child′s treatment was carried out and was recorded with a fixed digital video (<b>DV)</b> <b>recorder.</b> The treatments were classified into three levels of invasiveness: Noninvasive (NI), moderately invasive (MI), and highly invasive (HI). The entire DV record of each treatment was observed, and child′s dental behavior was rated independently by two precalibrated examiners using modified Venham′s behavior rating scale. Then, the background factors obtained through the questionnaire data were analyzed for its association with child′s dental behavior. Results: Statistical tests used were Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis to {{determine the}} relationship of multiple variables with dental behavior. Comparison of child′s behavior during different visits was done by Wilcoxan matched pairs test. The prevalence of BMP in children aged 7 - 11 years in {{the study sample was}} 0 %, 4. 2 %, and 15. 76 % for NI, MI, and HI procedures, respectively. Three variables were significant predictors of behavior; order of birth that is, first born, history of hospitalization, and unpleasant past dental experience (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Direct conditioning pathway is the major factor in determining child′s behavior. Dental experiences, duration of treatment, and complexity of treatment have greater impact on how the child behaves in a dental setup...|$|R

5000|$|<b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> drives {{have become}} {{standard}} equipment in many, though not all, computer systems {{currently on the}} market, after being initially popularized by the Pioneer/Apple SuperDrive; aftermarket drives as of early 2007 can cost as little as $23. [...] <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> drives {{can be used in}} conjunction with DVD authoring software to create DVDs near or equal to commercial quality, and are also widely used for data backup and exchange.

50|$|A <b>DVD</b> <b>{{recorder}}</b> is {{an optical}} disc recorder that uses Optical disc recording technologies to digitally record analog or digital signals onto blank writable DVD media.

50|$|Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding {{machines}} that physically stamp data onto the DVD.

5000|$|... 8 cm miniDVDs {{are widely}} used on some digital camcorders, {{primarily}} those meant for a consumer market ("point and shoot"); such discs are usually playable on a full-sized DVD player, but may not record on a full-sized <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> system.

50|$|Unlike {{the more}} common digital {{television}} adapter boxes, newer <b>DVD</b> <b>recorder</b> units are able to tune both analog and digital signals - an advantage when receiving low-power television and foreign (analogue) signals.
