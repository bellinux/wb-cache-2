GeoThentic is an online scaffolded learning environment that helps teachers integrate geospatial technologies in the K-12 classroom for learning geography.|$|E
50|$|It was Tim Johns (1991), however, {{who raised}} {{the profile of}} the use of {{concordancers}} in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL). DDL <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen (2011).|$|E

50|$|Active {{learning}} {{occurs when}} a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, {{it is important for}} learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result. In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn. Active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning. Conversely, passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or traditional education).|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the aims}} of PBL is the {{development}} of self-directed learning (SDL) skills. In Loyens, Magda & Rikers' discussion, SDL is defined as [...] "a process in which individuals take the initiative...in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes". [...] By being invited into the learning process, students are also invited {{to take responsibility for their}} learning, which leads to an increase in self-directed learning skills.In Severiens and Schmidt's study of 305 first year college students, they found that PBL and its focus on SDL led to motivation for students to maintain study pace, led to social and academic integration, encouraged development of cognitive skills, and fostered more study progress than students in a conventional learning setting. [...] PBL <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> take a place in the academic world through inquiring and discovery that is central to problem-based learning.|$|E

In contrast, submersion programs attempt to promote skills in a new language by eliminating them from a known language, which may actually limit learner competence in both.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, it is {{a difficult}} task for novices to think about metacognitive questions by themselves without having experience. Therefore, in this study, instead of simply encouraging novices to perform metacognitive questioning, it should be helpful if there is an environment <b>to</b> engage and <b>encourage</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> perform intrinsic comprehension of metacognitive questioning so that they can acquire S 2 SRL, eventually preparing them for the next step of metacognitive training. <b>To</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> gain S 2 SRL, it is necessary to motivate and facilitate them to clarify their own cognitive process of a given task in their mind. Later, they can use the experiences they have gained and stored in their minds as long-term memories as their cognitive target to perform meta-level thinking (Kayashima et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that self-assessment plays a profound role in autonomous language learning and, accordingly, leads to learner independency. It <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> prospect {{their own language}} learning processes and provides them with feedback of their learning progress. Self-assessment also raises the awareness of learners’ individual needs among both students and teachers alike and will therefore {{contribute to the development}} of the whole learning process...|$|E

Using the viewpoint of Triplet Structure Model, we analyze the satisfied constraints of posed problems. If learners pose problems randomly without thinking, they would pose many meaningless problems or less meaningful problems {{in terms of the}} constraints. That is to say, they do not {{think about the}} structure of arithmetic word problems.|$|E
30|$|Building on the {{findings}} of Singer and Goldin-Meadow (2005), Congdon et al. (2017) recently presented evidence that the simultaneous presentation of related but non-redundant information across modalities is particularly valuable for learning and transfer. They argued that simultaneous presentation of distinct information in speech and gesture <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> actively integrate information across modalities; such integration is not necessary when information in the two modalities is redundant. From this perspective, gestures may need to add information in order to be beneficial.|$|E

30|$|In essence, the eSchoolbag <b>encourages</b> <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> develop {{flexible}} understanding {{from multiple}} perspectives by inducing them to link learning contents to their everyday experiences, with the instructor {{as a facilitator}} rather than a focal point (Xie et al., 2015). However, on the other hand, {{it means that the}} eSchoolbag requires learners to allocate more cognitive and emotional effort than traditional learning environments. In fact, some researchers have pointed out that some students had low motivations in using eSchoolbag to assist their learning, since the eSchoolbag impeded them in concentrating their attentions (Dong, 2011; Wang, 2012).|$|E
