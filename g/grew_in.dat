5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler {{intensified}} the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> size and lethal operation, and <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{declined in}} mid-Wales after the 1860s, the weaving industry <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> villages in south-west Wales, which did well until the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Copiotrophic organisms tend to <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> high organic {{substrate}} conditions. For example, copiotrophic organisms <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> Sewage lagoons. They <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> {{organic substrate}} conditions up to 100x higher than oligotrophs.|$|R

50|$|Endospermum <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> humid lowland {{tropical}} climates {{where the}} temperature averages 22-28 degrees Celsius, {{with a mean}} rainfall of 1500-5600 mm annually. The species can <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> a variety of soil including soil that has been deposited by water flow next to rivers. Typically the plant <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> acidic to neutral soil. Additionally, the species <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> swamps.|$|R
5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century, road {{design and construction}} advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was {{the improvement of the}} routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|As the Internet <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> {{popularity}} and its traffic {{was required to}} be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as DHCP, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.|$|E
5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
50|$|Species <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> various {{conditions}} from dry, well-drained mineral-based soils to moist, organic soils; most <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> sunny locations, but {{a number}} also <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> forests (e.g., A. ursinum), or even in swamps or water.|$|R
50|$|It {{typically}} <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> river banks, {{ponds and}} swamps, <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> {{water up to}} 60 cm deep. Like the related genus Taxodium, it produces 'cypress knees' when <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> water, thought to help transport oxygen to the roots.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> soils of decomposing tuff, a {{volcanic}} ash substrate. The plants <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> {{cracks in the}} soil, {{so that they can}} appear to be <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> a straight line. There is little other vegetation in the habitat, but associated plants may include Artemisia arbuscula.|$|R
5|$|As {{the sport}} <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> popularity, new bouldering areas were {{developed}} throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility {{of the sport}} greatly increased in the early 2000s, as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers {{around the world to}} quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.|$|E
5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E
5|$|Bengal Subah {{was one of}} {{the wealthiest}} parts of the Mughal empire. As the Mughal empire began to decline, the Nawabs <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> power, {{although}} nominally subordinate to the Mughal emperor. They wielded great power in their own right and finally became independent rulers of the Bengal region, for all practical purposes, by the early 1700s.|$|E

5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and {{public interest in}} the animals <b>grew.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led {{to the discovery of}} the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{grants and}} subsidies, {{cultural}} events and institutions <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> Fairbanks. The Fairbanks Light Opera Theatre {{was created in}} 1970, and {{groups such as the}} Fairbanks Concert Association and the Northstar Ballet were also created at about the same time. Fairbanks largest arts event, the Summer Arts Festival, began in 1980 and continues today.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the Large Black <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> popularity. A breed association, the Large Black Pig Society, {{was formed in}} 1898 or 1899, in Ipswich, Suffolk. A trademark, {{consisting}} of the letters LBP within a shield, was registered in 1902.|$|E
50|$|Stachyurus praecox var. matsuzakii is a {{deciduous}} shrub that <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> mountainous {{regions that}} {{are near the}} coast.

5|$|From the 1550s to the 1640s, as {{a result}} of {{increased}} foreign trade, Aalborg enjoyed great prosperity, second only to that of Copenhagen. The population <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> parallel with the development of many fine buildings in the city as merchants benefitted from their shipping routes from Norway to Portugal. In 1663, the city suffered yet another serious fire, which destroyed the tower of Budolfi Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} {{woodland}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing development {{on the western side}} of the gorge as Bristol <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, many {{countries}} had women's national football teams. While the sport <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> popularity worldwide {{in the ensuing}} years, Burundi {{did not have an}} official team until more than two decades later. By 2009, however, Burundi had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised Burundi women's under-20 national team. The under-20 team played one international match in 2002, one in 2004 and one in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E
