A model to evaluate effectiveness was developed, followed by the preparation of a self-administered questionnaire of the Likert type. After pilot testing, the questionnaire was despatched. The empirical study was conducted on the majority of Israeli municipalities that possess an <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>unit.</b> The respondent groups also included journalists at local newspapers who cover the annual municipality <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> reports. The returned questionnaires provided the data used in the research analysis. After factor analysis, the model emerged based on the following components: Independence, Competence, Scope of work, Performance of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>unit,</b> and the Implementation of corrective action following the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> findings. The respondents were divided into five groups: (1) Staff of the municipality <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>unit</b> (2) Councillors - elected by the public (3) Top management (4) Middle level management (5) Journalists. Meetings were also held with the mayors of various municipalities to ascertain their opinions on the results of the data analysis. The research findings revealed major differences in the evaluation of effectiveness between different groups of users. In general, the research shows that the closer the user stands to the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> operation, the higher the evaluation. The implementation of corrective action following the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> findings was rated by all the respondent groups as lower than the other components. Another result is that the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>unit</b> tends to be perceived as less effective in smaller municipalities; for this comparison, municipalities were divided into three categories according to population size. The research has yielded various recommendations for operational change in order to improve the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in municipalities.

40|$|Background: Corporate {{governance}} maybe approached {{through several}} {{functions such as}} <b>auditing,</b> an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> committee, information management, compliance, corporate citizenship and risk management. However, most organisations, including governmental bodies, regularly exclude records management from the criteria for a good corporate-governance infrastructure. Proper records management could be the backbone of establishing good corporate governance. Objectives: Utilising the King report III on corporate governance as a framework, this quantitative study explores the role of records management in corporate governance in governmental bodies of South Africa. Method: Report data were collected through questionnaires directed to records managers and auditors in governmental bodies, as well as interviews with purposively selected auditors from the Auditor-General of South Africa. Data were analysed using various analytical tools and through written descriptions, numerical summarisations and tables. Results: The study revealed that records management is not regarded as an essential component for corporate governance. Records management is only discussed as a footnote; as a result it is a forgotten function with no consequences in government administration in South Africa. The study further revealed that most governmental bodies have established <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>units</b> and <b>audit</b> committees. However, records-management professionals were excluded from such committees. Conclusion: The study concludes by arguing that if records management is removed as a footnote of the public-sector operations {{and placed in the}} centre of operational concern, it will undoubtedly make a meaningful contribution to good corporate governance. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{consensus}} among scholars that proper records management {{plays a significant role}} in the auditing process. Despite this role, in South Africa, many governmental bodies are issued with disclaimer opinions every year by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) due to a lack of supporting documentation. Whenever AGSA embarks on an audit assignment, the first constraint it faces is that records either do not exist or, if they do exist, are disorganised, and retrieval becomes problematic, resulting in a disclaimer of opinion. Furthermore, many public organisations rarely see the connection between the lack of proper records management and failures of financial accountability. This article reports on part of doctoral research project by Ngoepe in 2012 that sought to develop a framework to embed the records management function into the auditing process. However, this article seeks to investigate the role of records management in the auditing process in the public sector of South Africa, with a view to entrenching a culture of clean audits. The study relied on both quantitative and qualitative approaches, with thequantitative paradigm as the dominant design, while the qualitative paradigm was used to substantiate numerical data. Data collection adopted a multi-approach with three key sources of data: a questionnaire, interviews and literature review. The results indicate that in most governmental bodies records management did not form part of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> scope, hence many record-keeping issues were identified by external auditors at a later stage.

40|$|Proper records {{management}} plays {{a significant role}} in the auditing process, risk management and wider corporate governance. Despite this role, in South Africa, many governmental bodies are issued with disclaimer reports every year by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) due to a lack of supporting documentation. This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of {{records management}} from the criteria for a sound financial management infrastructure in many governmental bodies. The other dilemma is that some records such as financial records, personnel records and electronic records usually fall outside the jurisdiction of the organisation’s records manager. Utilising the King Report III as a framework, this study sought to develop a framework to embed records management practices into the auditing process in the public sector of South Africa, with a view to entrench a culture of clean audits. The study relied on mixed methods research (MMR), with the quantitative study conducted first through informetrics analysis of audit reports, while the qualitative paradigm was used to substantiate numerical data. Data collection adopted a multi-approach with four key sources of data: a questionnaire, interviews, literature review and publicly available data from the consolidated general reports of AGSA. The study revealed that most governmental bodies have established <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>units,</b> <b>audit</b> committees and records management units, which did not work in unison. In most governmental bodies records management did not form part of the audit scope and records management professionals were not part of the audit committees. As a result, most governmental bodies continued to receive negative audit opinions from AGSA. The study recommends that records management community should utilise auditing and risk management as a springboard to propel records management to the new heights. A further empirical study on the role of auditing and risk management in records management that embraces both the private and public sectors is recommended. Information ScienceD. Litt. et Phil.
