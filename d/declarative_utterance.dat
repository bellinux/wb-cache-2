The external perspective deals with the global system that may consist of several agents exchanging information. The effect of dialogue acts like an assertion or question on the attitudes of agents is modelled by a multi-modal logic. This is the approach taken in chapter 4.

40|$|Sentence final {{particles}} (SFPs) play {{an important}} role in the every-day spoken communication of various languages. For example, the addition of a Dutch intentional particle hè or hoor to a bare <b>declarative</b> <b>utterance</b> such as het is lekker weer ‘the weather is great’ can make the difference between the sentence being interpreted as an agreement-seeking question, or a correction. Still, we know very little about the psycho- and neurolinguistic properties of the processing and production of final particles. The purpose of this thesis is to generate more research on the psycholinguistics side and to deepen the theoretical knowledge we have by gathering experimental data. There are theoretical reasons to assume that intentional SFPs {{play an important}} role from the beginning of sentence formulation. The SFP-head selects for the entire proposition as its complement, so it is possible that speakers plan the particle ahead before they start producing the rest of the sentence. This hypothesis also makes sense from a psycholinguistic perspective, as it is presumed that the intention of the speaker is already determined before he/she starts uttering a sentence. In this thesis, I focus on sentences in isolation, and investigate the production, planning and perception of Dutch pragmatic particles (i. e. SFPs) that convey the speaker’s intention. The question I pursued to answer is whether Dutch sentence final particles are planned in advance, or whether they are inserted at the final moment. To investigate the potential planning of intentional SFPs I conducted three experiments. In a production experiment (Experiment 1) I investigated whether the speaker already starts encoding the intention of the message with prosodic cues preceding the intentional particle. Such cues would indicate that the speaker is already building up the illocutionary force of the sentence before the particle. Results indicate that there are such cues, and that even though they are sometimes quite small, they are used quite consistently across participants. In Experiment 2, the gating-technique is used in a perception experiment to investigate whether these prosodic cues preceding the particle could possibly help the listener anticipate for the intention or attitude expressed by an utterance. The results of this experiment indicate that participants were not that good at anticipating the end of sentences containing the final particles hè and hoor in the given task. Experiment 3 directly addresses the question whether the speaker plans a final particle ahead or whether they integrate the particle at a later stage of production. This question is about how incremental and how far ahead a sentence is planned in production. In this experiment, I examined the production process of the intentional SFPs hè and hoor in Dutch with a variant on the picture-word-interference task to investigate whether the particles are planned in advance, or not. I created an experiment that manipulates the prime preceding colored pictures, which are associated in a training task with a particular final element. The target condition of the experiment contains sentences with the final elements hè and hoor, which are intentional final particles. The effect of the distractor prime on the target condition was compared to a control condition. A congruent prime was assumed to facilitate sentence production at speech onset, only if the speaker is already planning the particle congruent with the prime. In the control conditions, in which it is assumed that speakers are not yet planning ahead for the final element of the sentence at speech onset, facilitation was assumed not to take place at speech onset. The results obtained for this experiment were not significant, due to high standard deviations. In future research it would be interesting to see whether the paradigm of this experiment could be adjusted, to gain more reliable results that can answer the main question we pursued...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we follow two {{beginning}} learners of English, Andrea and Santo, {{over a period}} of 2 years as they develop means to structure the <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> they produce in various production tasks, and then we look at the following problem: In the early stages of acquisition, both learners develop a common learner variety; during these stages, we see a picture of two learner varieties developing similar regularities determined by the minimal requirements of the tasks we examine. Andrea subsequently develops further morphosyntactic means to achieve greater cohesion in his discourse. But Santo does not. Although we can identify contexts where the grammaticalization of Andrea's production allows him to go beyond the initial constraints of his variety, it is much more difficult to ascertain why Santo, faced with the same constraints in the same contexts, does not follow this path. Some lines of investigation into this problem are then suggested. We take the view that there are a limited number of pragmatic, semantic, and phrasal (morphosyntactic) organizational principles at work in learner languages, and that their interaction determines the actual organization of a given learner variety. The kind of interaction, and hence the specific contribution of each princi-ple, may vary as a function of source language influence and of the proficiency level of the learner. Thus, the process of acquisition 1 can be viewed as the change in the interaction of these principles over time, and grammaticalization as one direction this change may (but need not) take, where the learner comes to give relatively more weight to phrasal principles.

Research on speaking styles is still largely based on adult speech. References to teenagers are sparse and cross-analyses of speech types comparing teenagers and adults are rare. We expect CPE-FACES, currently a unique resource in this domain, will contribute to filling this gap in European Portuguese.

40|$|International audienceWithin the Autosegmental-Metrical {{approach}} to French intonation, {{two levels of}} phrasing are generally accepted, the Accentual Phrase (AP) and the Intonation Phrase (IP), while {{the existence of an}} intermediate level, i. e., the intermediate phrase or ip, is controversial.

This mechanism is claimed to result from control over the reference pitch level for the entire ip, which can alternatively be modeled through secondary association of the last pitch accent of the domain. We also report on duration evidence pointing to the existence of preboundary lengthening associated to the last syllable of the ip.

Data was drawn from a production experiment (Hamzah, 2012) involving <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> under different focus patterns in a question-answer context, as well as from story-telling interviews and TV interviews. We find evidence for at least three levels of prosodic organization: (i) an accentual phrase which comprises one or more words and bears an L and H tone at its left and right edges, respectively, (ii) an intermediate phrase, which serves as the domain of catathesis, and (iii) an intonational phrase, which may span the entire utterance and bears an additional H or L tone at its right edge.

The motivation for this study stems from contradictory claims in the literature regarding whether downtrend is governed by local or global factors. Three speakers of Mexican Spanish read a total of 540 <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> (2304 target pitch accents) of varying length (from two to five pitch accents) and varying distance between H * pitch accents (from two to three intervening unstressed syllables). The data reveal that the f 0 value of the previous peak (as opposed to phrasal position) is the most important predictor of peak height. In our data, between 65 and 80 % of the variance of the data is predicted by exclusively using a local downstep ratio or constant reduction in the previous peak’s pitch value. Neither phrasal length nor distance between adjacent pitch accents has a significant ef fect on the height of a given f 0 peak. Utterance-final peaks are best predicted by using a particular ratio of decay (higher than the downstep ratio) and a phrasal length factor: the use of the latter factor reflects a tendency for final peaks in longer utterances to remain at a relatively high f 0 level. ÷ 1996 Academic Press Limited...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of papers, Roy Sorensen has {{identified}} several overlooked categories of lying: bald-faced lying (Sorensen 2007), knowledge-lying (Sorensen 2010), and now lying with conditionals. In each case, he has argued that such lies spell trouble for the traditional philosophical definition of lying. According to that definition (see Mahon 2008, section 1), you are lying if: you believe that {{what you say is}} false (or at least you do not believe it to be true). you intend to mislead your audience into believing what you say. I think that Sorensen is right with respect to bald-faced lies (see Fallis 2009, 39 - 43).

Note: Other philosophers (e. g., Carson 2010) have investigated several categories of phenomena closely related to lying, such as bullshit, half-truths, and keeping someone in the dark. But Sorensen has certainly done the most to tease out the various types of lies. As Sorensen points out, philosophers of lying have focused exclusively on lies that are <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances,</b> such as when the shepherd boy cries, “There is a wolf chasing my sheep! ” Thus, expanding out “diet of examples ” to include lying with conditionals is philosophically beneficial.

40|$|Production {{studies of}} the intonational {{signalling}} of focus in European Portuguese (EP) have shown that focus is expressed by a specific pitch accent type, thus revealing a systematic contrast between nuclear accents associated with different meanings. In <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances,</b> {{the contrast between the}} neutral/broad focus reading and the narrow/contrastive focus reading is essentially realized as an alignment difference: H+L* (neutral accent) and H*+L (focus accent). A pilot perceptual study using natural stimuli has shown that subjects are able to distinguish between members of neutral/focus minimal pairs and to match them to the appropriate production context. However, the perception of the contrast found in production has not yet been investigated in detail. The present paper revisits the production contrast and investigates its categorical nature using a multiple methodology approach that resorts to semantically motivated tasks. Several experiments tested whether differences in F 0 peak and valley alignment would trigger a perceptual change from one meaning to the other, and whether the alignment differences pattern alike in stimuli based on a neutral and a focus sentence. In Experiment 1, stimuli were classified in a context-matching identification task. In Experiment 2, participants rated appropriateness of stimulus to context in a semantic scaling task. Finally, in Experiment 3, pairs of stimuli were discriminated in a context-matching discrimination task. The results of the three experiments provide converging evidence for the distinction between H+L* and H*+L. Moreover, they support the claim that the neutral/focus accent distinction is primarily an alignment contrast phonologically encoded at the pitch accent level. These findings have implications for the {{understanding of the nature of}} intonational contrasts, and the discussion about the approaches and methods to define prosodic categories. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} explores some of {{the salient}} issues relating to the cross-linguistic analyses of constituent ordering in sign languages. There are three main themes which we address: Part 1 considers the exisiting literature on constituent order in sign languages; Part 2 focuses on problems encountered in compiling {{the results of this}} body of data for cross-linguistic comparison, and Part 3 outlines the process of developing a small comparative analysis of <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> in three sign languages using a widely applied elicitation task and a shared set of guidelines regarding interpretation of the data. We expand on our proposal for each theme in greater detail below: Part 1 : Part 1 deals with consideration of the literature regarding constituent order in sign languages, focusing specifically on data collated using the Volterra et al. (1984) picture elicitation task, which discusses three types of declarative sentences (locative, reversible, and non-reversible). We focus on the Volterra data given that this material has been applied {{to a wide range of}} unrelated sign langauges for example, Italian Sign Language (LIS), German-Swiss Sign Language, Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN), British Sign Language (BSL), Irish Sign Language (ISL), and Flemish Sign Language (VGT), which leads one to expect that a broad range of data could be relatively easily compared cross-linguistically. However, there are a range of difficulties involved in comparing and contrasting the data, which we address in part 2 of this paper. Part 2 : Here we problematise the issue of cross-linguistic comparisons which arise for a range of reasons. These include for example, the fact that the linguistic framework for analyses may differ significantly from study to study (e. g. Neidle et al. (2000) use Chomsky’s Minimalist Program while Coerts (1994) use Dik’s Functional Linguistics); the fact that the definition of basic notions, such as subject and object are either not defined at all or are interpreted in different ways; certain structures are dealt with diffently in different analyses – or treated as special cases or marginal cases and excluded from any core discussion of results (e. g. polymorphemic verbs, simultaneous constructions); the assignment of semantic roles/ macro-roles is applied inconsistently across the literature, and more basic issues such as defining the scope of the sentence/ clause often remain undiscussed. All these issues conspire to make valid comparison of the available body of data on constituent order difficult. Given these issues, we designed a small three-way cross-linguistic “test-case” where the criteria for data collection, and most specifically, for the analysis and interpretation of the data were clearly defined at the outset. This is discussed in more detail in Part 3. Part 3 : In this section we outline the results of our collaborative “test-case” which focused on three sign languages, namely Flemish Sign Language (VGT), Irish Sign Language (ISL) and Australian Sign Language (Auslan). The research was driven by the Volterra et al. picture elicitation task data. Four informants contributed to the data in each of the three sign languages (i. e. a total of 12 informants). To minimise sociolinguistic complexities associated with generational variation, we controlled for age range, including signers in the age group 20 - 30 years only. We also considered gender as a potential influencing factor and thus, this test-case includes only male signers. Native competence was also controlled. The presenters suggest that this analysis is unique insofar as it represents a collaborative attempt to apply the same notions to constituents and to the interpretation of data, allowing for a valid cross-linguistic comparison. Summary of Intended Outcomes: This paper will provide the following: •	an overview of issues that are problematic when considering cnstituent order in sign languages – even where similar elicitation materials are used. This will be useful for other researchers considering exploring this issue. •	discussion of the possibility of carrying out cross-linguistic work on constituent order in sign languages through collaboration, with focus placed on the practical issues for consideration at each step in the process from reserach design to data collection and shared analysis protocol. •	the results of a test-case comparison of <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> in three sign languages as an indicator of how more large-scale projects might unfold. We take this opportunity to note that we do not in any way wish to suggest that constituent order in sign langauges can be fully accounted for on the basis of our results regarding simple <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances.</b> We are aware that the idea of identifying ‘basic word order’ is a complex issue and that in-depth analysis thereof requires the use of naturally occurring data and consideration of the range of pragmatic factors that affects word order. Nevertheless, our view is that the analysis of a range of declarative sentences in a controlled manner is a small step on the path to fuller understanding. Such a small-scale and controlled case-study can pinpoint issues and problems that demand further consideration and analysis.

In Sociolinguistics, different style in speaking is known as speech styles. This study investigates speech style produced by Najwa Sihab in Mata Najwa Metro TV talk show. Mata Najwa is one of Metro TV talk show programs hosted by a senior journalist, Najwa Shihab. In conducting the research, the writer tries to find the speech style used by Najwa Sihab in terms of diction and sentence structure. Moreover, the writer also tries {{to find out the}} possible reasons underlying the use of certain style. The main theory used in this study is by Keraf (2008), supported by Kridalaksana (1992), Holmes (2001) and Rais (2012). This study uses qualitative approach since the writer tries to analyze the transcript of Najwa Sihab utterances. The data of the study are Najwa Sihab 2 ̆ 7 s <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> containing speech style in “Di Balik Diam Budiono” episode. The writer finds that Najwa Sihab uses informal style more dominantly than formal style in terms of diction. It means that Najwa tries to be more casual and makes the guest star more comfortable for being interviewed. While in terms of sentence structure, the writer cannot find the parallelism style and the mostly uses by Najwa is repetition style. Repetition is used to emphasize the certain point and also used to affirm something more clearly. From all the styles that are found, the writer interprets the reasons of each style and finds that the types of speech in terms of diction are mostly influenced by the factors of choosing speech style proposed by Holmes (2001), while the reason of choosing speech style in terms of sentence structure are mostly influenced by the function of the speech style itself. Finally, the writer hopes that this study can add knowledge for the students of English Study Program as the reference in conducting further studies of speech style. Moreover, there will be other studies that discuss about speech style with the different object or even the different theory...|$|R

40|$|Human {{social life}} {{relies on the}} {{production}} of mutually-recognisable actions. This study {{is part of a}} project investigating the linguistic resources used by speakers of Italian to make requests. In a corpus of naturally-occurring informal interaction, a large number of requests are implemented through recurrent lexico-syntactic forms such as imperatives (e. g., Passami il piatto ‘Pass me the plate’), second person interrogatives (e. g., Mi passi il piatto? ‘Will you pass me the plate?’), and modal declaratives (e. g., Dovresti passarmi il piatto ‘You should pass me the plate’). A common property of these forms is that they make the act of requesting transparent to co-participants, by specifying both what the target activity is and who is to do it. In contrast to this, the present study focuses on utterances that do not signal a request action in their surface form. More specifically, it looks at <b>declarative</b> <b>utterances</b> that describe a certain state of affairs or event in the immediate environment, such as the lack of something (e. g., Manca sale ‘There isn't enough salt’) or the reaching of a stage in a process (e. g. L'acqua bolle 'The water is boiling'). Linguistic forms of this kind functioning as requests have been traditionally called 'indirect requests'. Indirect requests have attracted much attention by philosophers, linguists, and psychologists, who have been especially interested in the inferential processes underlying their comprehension (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1975; Gordon & Lakoff, 1975; Clark & Lucy, 1975; Ervin-Tripp, 1981; Gibbs 1981; among many others). In this paper, I investigate the use of indirect forms of requesting in video recordings of naturally-occurring interaction. First, I analyse the interactional import of utterances like ‘There isn’t enough salt’ or ‘The water is boiling’ aside from their request function, that is, as statements that present co-participants with new information, and that allow for different kinds of uptake in next position. Second, I focus on co-participants’ responses to these statements that display an understanding of the social relevance of the new information, resulting in their engagement in an appropriate practical task. Third, I examine speakers’ and co-participants’ relative roles in the current activity, and other situational asymmetries between them (e. g., being closer to the salt), as factors that define the rights and obligations to act on the matter in question. By bringing to the fore the social distribution of agency, this analysis offers a new perspective on processes of ‘indirect speech’ comprehension that have been so far primarily considered in their cognitive and individual aspects. Finally, I discuss the affordances and social pay-offs of ‘indirect’ forms of requesting relative to ‘direct’ ones...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} whether the pitch range of a speaker can vary according to the language he speaks. The hypothesis is tested on Finnish university students studying Russian as a foreign language before and after their stay in Russia. First, the global pitch range (max – min) is determined. Second, the pitch range in different types of <b>utterances</b> (<b>declarative,</b> question, exclamation) is examined by superimposing pitch contours. The results indicate that the learners have a narrower pitch range and a less variable pitch than native speakers both in L 1 and L 2. However, the results also suggest that L 2 experience seems to help most students to produce a more native-like pitch range, especially in questions...|$|R
