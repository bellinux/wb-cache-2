5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>life.</b> However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready.

The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances.
