Uncertainty distributions for the decontamination factors and decontamination coefficients as functions of time were developed in the Monte Carlo analyses by considering uncertainties in aerosol processes, material properties, reactor geometry and severe accident progression. Phenomenological uncertainties examined in this work included uncertainties in aerosol coagulation by gravitational collision, Brownian diffusion, turbulent diffusion and turbulent inertia. Uncertainties in aerosol deposition by gravitational settling, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, and turbulent diffusion were examined. Electrostatic charging of aerosol particles in severe accidents is discussed. Such charging could affect both the coagulation and deposition of aerosol particles. Electrostatic effects are not considered in most available models of aerosol behavior during severe accidents and cause uncertainties in predicted natural decontamination processes that could not be taken in to account in this work. Median (50 %), 90 and 10 % values of the uncertainty distributions for effective decontamination coefficients were correlated with time and reactor thermal power.

The low thermal conductivity and the low fission products retention capacity of oxide fuel, combined with important amounts of zirconium in the clad, lead to an uncontrollably soon fuel failure after losing the coolant inside the core. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of replacing current oxide fuel used in Light Water Reactor with an alternative fuel that performs a better behavior <b>under</b> these <b>accident</b> <b>conditions.</b> The alternative fuel studied is the Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel based on the TRISO particles technology, which enhances safety after a loss-of-coolant accident because of its better thermal conductivity and fission products retention capability. The aim of the project is to compare the neutronics behavior and safety parameters between the current 17 x 17 Westinghouse fuel assembly and a new fuel assembly model, designed to replace the original but using FCM fuel.
