5|$|As Cayman-Global attacks Eurocorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's {{office to}} prevent him from {{activating}} the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both Eurocorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the <b>kill-switch</b> order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, Eurocorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.|$|E

However, the Internet has central components that {{are vulnerable to}} monitoring, censorship and Internet <b>kill-switches.</b> Human rights, like the protection of privacy, honor and reputation are endangered by this. Mobile devices with peer-to-peer communication technology {{can be used to}} build a server-less distributed system for information exchange and viral spreading. This thesis work contributes a self-organizing video-on-demand platform that is attack-resilient and can operate autonomously on a mobile device. For this, we make use of Tribler, which was only available for desktop platforms before. An open source prototype is built for Android OS, with a modular architecture specifically designed for portability and maintainability. Various measurements on different devices are conducted to quantify the performance and resource usage of the implementation. The results indicate our prototype can feasibly run Tribler on mobile devices. Therefore, millions of people that own a smartphone can now benefit from Tribler’s attack-resilient and privacy enhancing information exchange.

5000|$|One partial {{solution}} to the <b>kill-switch</b> problem involves [...] "utility balancing": Some utility-based agents can, with some important caveats, be programmed to [...] "compensate" [...] themselves exactly for any lost utility caused by an interruption or shutdown, {{in such a way}} that they end up being indifferent to whether they are interrupted or not. The caveats include a severe unsolved problem that, as with evidential decision theory, the agent might follow a catastrophic policy of [...] "managing the news". Alternatively, in 2016, scientists Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called [...] "safely interruptible agents" [...] (SIA), can eventually [...] "learn" [...] to become indifferent to whether their [...] "kill switch" [...] (or other [...] "interruption switch") gets pressed.|$|E

5000|$|One {{category}} of presence sensing devices is Photoelectric Sensors. Light Curtains {{fall into this}} category. Light curtains use many infrared light beams to form a perimeter around machinery. When two or more consecutively adjacent beams are interrupted, a <b>kill-switch</b> stops the machine until the boundary is reset. Light curtains must be {{placed in front of}} the work area. This makes it difficult for press brake operators to work on small parts. One cannot help but disrupt the beam. The operator might [...] "mute" [...] the light curtain {{in order to get the}} job done. Certain parts of the beam can be muted. For example, muting the front and rear of the beam allows the middle to offer continued protection for the operator.

50|$|Back with Ringer, who {{is still}} paralyzed, Vosch walks towards her. He {{explains}} to her what he told Evan about the Others plans and that he wanted Ringer {{to go with him}} to the mothership. Vosch feels as if he is her father since he has created her, that she is the only person he has ever met that reminds him of himself. She denies his request to join him. During their conversation which acts as a distraction, Cassie appears behind Vosch and shoots him in the head, killing him. She emotionlessly tells Ringer that she killed Evan Walker, and Ringer consoles her, as she thinks the person Cassie killed was just a shell of a person without humanity. Cassie, with her downloaded knowledge, uses a keypad to open a secret door to Vosch's escape pod. She takes a knife and cuts off his thumb to access the biometrics to allow further access. As Cassie gets into the escape pod Ringer stays behind and prepares to take the explosive pill Vosch gave her. As she searches her pockets she can't find it and then remembers that she switched outfits with Cassie and now Cassie has it. Ringer then drags herself to Vosch's dead body and searches his pockets for the <b>kill-switch</b> that will kill all 5000 soldiers at the base who have tracker implants. As she finds it General Order 4 is turned off and all the soldiers begin to ascend towards her.|$|E
50|$|Prankster gathers {{an army of}} {{followers}} who sympathetic to his cause. Upon hacking every screen in the city, Prankster states that the Mayor Wallace Cole isn't what {{he claims to be}} and has been harboring Tony Zucco. Prankster then takes a group of police officers hostage where he has been tying them to an automatic weapon where if they move, they will die. He explains that all of this carnage is merely in keeping with the precedent that Mayor Wallace Cole set profiting while the innocent suffer. He explains that if the Mayor pays back the money he took, they will all live. If not, they will live {{for as long as they}} can stay still. Since the Prankster first issued the mayor an ultimatum to pay back 52 million embezzled tax dollars or the people of Chicago will suffer just like the city has been suffering. Of the policemen the Prankster held hostage at gunpoint, only five survive. An electronic attack on the transportation grid overloaded traffic lights. Explosives at the Navy Pier caused a flaming ferris wheel to cause a lot of damage. As a result, the city was put on lockdown, while protesters at City Hall demanded their money back. All the while, Mayor Wallace Cole claimed that he had done no wrong. Prankster's army {{of followers}} have been causing havoc in Chicago. Upon capturing a Prankster follower named Danny, Nightwing learns where Prankster can be found. Prankster later appears in Mayor Wallace Cole's office where he shoots down the Alderm. As Nightwing attempts to rush Zucco to jail, the man shouts from the back of the Wingcycle that Wallace Cole became mayor of Chicago because of two events. The first was a train line that he and his brother William convinced City Hall to run through their old Pilsen neighborhood. When the project's electrical engineer Harold Loomis died on Halloween, William took the fall. The chaos that the Prankster is causing isn't because Wallace Cole stole money from the City. It's because he wants payback. The Prankster is Harold Loomis' son. Tony had learned this because he shared a cell with William Cole, who had received a reminder from the boy of the crime he had committed: the same mask that the Prankster wears today. It is no coincidence that the Prankster's crimes are taking place in October. Tonight is Halloween, and the Prankster intends to bring things to a boil tonight. Meanwhile, Wallace Cole professes his innocence to the man holding Chicago hostage who turns out to be Oswald Loomis. Angrily, the Prankster explains that the Coles took away what he had loved most and profited from it. So, now he is returning the favor by taking away what was most important to Wallace Cole....the love of Chicago. By going after real corrupt politicians at first, the Prankster established a certain trust with the people of Chicago that he only targeted criminals. So, they would certainly believe him when he accused the mayor of corruption. Blowing up the L-train allowed his people the time they needed to fill old Pilsen station with enough explosives to collapse the south side. Tossing Wallace a remote, he delights in reminding that the only one who can stop the countdown is the man Chicago hates the most. As Wallace runs down the street toward the station, the Prankster fires off a shot, drawing the citizens' attention to the mayor. If the mayor even survives their attempts to get justice by beating him savagely, he may not get to the station in time. Rushing, Nightwing has Zucco get the mayor away from the blast radius, just as he feels the Prankster hacking into his mask's lenses again. Having learned already, Nightwing activates a <b>kill-switch</b> that lets him see again, but by the time he does, the Prankster is long away. Despite that success, is attacked by the Prankster just moments after getting to shore. Suddenly, though, he falls away as three shots hit him in the shoulder from the three bullets shot from Tony Zucco's gun. Dick is relieved to see that the bullets went clean-through, and Oswald Loomis will survive. Wistfully, Tony Zucco explains that he had only started carrying a gun in the first place because he worried that he'd have to kill Nightwing on this encounter. Instead, he had used it to help the vigilante. As the police arrive on the scene, Nightwing swings away, leaving Tony Zucco and Prankster to face justice.|$|E
40|$|The new U. S. Model {{income tax}} treaty {{contains}} an unusual addition: mechanisms for {{the parties to}} unilaterally override the negotiated treaty rates in specified circumstances. Previewed last year in proposed form—a first for the Treasury—these new mechanisms work as kill-switches, partially terminating the treaty as to one or both treaty partners. The idea is to forestall a more problematic outcome, such as an enduring breach {{of one of the}} parties’ expectations, or the opposite, a complete termination of all the treaty terms {{in the face of such}} a breach. Yet embedding a <b>kill-switch</b> in a treaty creates distinct legal, procedural, and political pressures in the tax-treaty relationship that implicate treaty negotiation, ratification, interpretation, and dispute resolution. Kill-switches also communicate a defensive tenor in the tax treaty relationships among many countries.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} an incentive-based {{trust model}} to let wireless spectrum regulation embrace diverse {{current and future}} means of implementing cognitive radio. Cognitive radio {{has emerged as a}} way to combat inefficient spectrum use by allowing independently designed networks to share the same frequency band. This philosophy has been embraced by the FCC, which has already allowed cognitive use in the TV bands, and plans to make spectrum sharing the norm in other bands as well. To enact spectrum sharing, regulatory decisions, like band assignment, are made at runtime so that they can reflect local context. From a regulatory perspective, the most important question is how to trust that these decisions will be made and carried out correctly. Right now, the FCC guarantees correct decisions by directly testing that any deployed technologies are incapable of making bad decisions. This process of testing is called certification. But certification has limitations. For example, a network of nodes could sense for a TV signal and decide as a group that the TV tower is far enough away that their interference to TV receivers would be negligible. However, this network will never pass a certification test. There is no way to prove that the network will stay silent if all the nodes are blocked by the same building so they cannot sense the tower but can cause interference. This thesis provides a new model for trust that would allow networked sensing and any other novel spectrum sharing solution through light-handed regulations. The idea is to build a system that allows regulators to trust secondaries to follow sharing rules regardless of whether they are technically capable of finding spectrum holes. This is accomplished by an incentive mechanism, a spectrum jail, that will punish secondaries caught causing interference by degrading their quality of service. This thesis shows that for such a mechanism to work, cognitive radio must {{be thought of as a}} band-expander. If the same mechanism must apply to all radios, regardless of technology, there must be pretty good unlicensed or licensed bands that secondaries can use if they cannot share spectrum appropriately. The mechanism explored here is inspired by the ideas in the law and economics literature as well as the spectrum policy literature. This thesis takes these mostly rhetorical arguments and develops the first mathematical model for incentive-based trust in spectrum regulation. This model allows identification of the most difficult to enforce cases: the regulator must decide whether a primary will be protected even if it hardly ever uses its band. The regulator must also decide what constitutes harmful interference. Some interference is unavoidable when bands are shared; the regulator must decide how much interference the primary must accept in a shared environment. When these decisions are made, this thesis shows that trust can be guaranteed with a sanction set at certification time and which is applied to all cognitive devices regardless of technology. The model also gives quantitative performance metrics, measuring the ability for secondaries to reclaim spectrum holes, which illustrate the dependence on the regulator's ability to catch wrongdoers. In particular, this thesis shows that while trust depends on the ability to catch those causing interference, runtime performance depends on the wrongful conviction rate. So, even applying the same sanction, as spectrum sharing technology and catching technology improves, performance will improve as well. This model is extended to understand what role the primary can or must play in its own protection as new primary devices are developed to operate in a shared band. By controlling the cost of reporting, the regulator can trust a primary to report interference correctly. This also means that if a secondary is difficult to coexist with, the primary will not use the jail system to try to get rid of the secondary. It will instead hire a ``band-sitter,'' which is a preferred secondary system that coexists more easily with the primary. This thesis also addresses multiple secondaries and aggregate interference by giving a basic framework of results to guide research in this direction. The distribution of aggregate interference from randomly placed nodes is explored to understand placement risk: the threat of too much interference caused by clusters of secondaries too close to the primary. Then, the thesis develops strategies to use the secondary location information that TV whitespace databases already have to address the problem of placement risk. Finally, a basic queuing model is suggested as a future direction to extend spectrum jails to deal with multiple secondaries. Finally, this thesis answers the question of why jails? The original motivation is two-fold. First, jails lend themselves to simple modeling because the utility and the sanction are both measured in quality of service terms. Second, jails can actually be reasonably implemented. The FCC has allowed TV whitespace devices using databases to coordinate spectrum access. In order to actually secure this operation, databases will need to be able to identify malfunctioning devices and turn them off. These same identity and <b>kill-switch</b> technologies will also enable spectrum jails. Jails can even be implemented through the databases themselves as a denial of operating tokens. At a more philosophical level, in-kind and monetary sanctions are fundamentally different things. Which one is actually better suited to the spectrum sharing enforcement problem? The last chapter will apply the same performance-based understanding from the the rest of the thesis to understand when fines or in-kind punishments should be preferred. It shows that in cases of high uncertainty, or when primary protection is the most important consideration, in-kind sanctions are the right approach...|$|E
