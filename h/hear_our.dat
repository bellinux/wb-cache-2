500|$|Actress Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith Palmer, {{attributed}} {{her love of}} the episode to Craig Robinson, because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode [...] "Basketball". She explained, [...] "We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer. We sound good together, but sometimes people {{are not in the}} mood to <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> amazing duets, mostly from the '80s." [...] Flannery believed that Robinson's performance in the episode was [...] "very funny," [...] as his character served as a [...] "great foil for Michael Scott." [...] "The Negotiation" [...] featured the return of character Andy Bernard, who had last been seen in the episode [...] "The Return", as he was attending anger management classes. At the time [...] "The Return" [...] aired, no one was certain Helms would be returning, but in early February, NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

Prior to its release, drummer Jordison proclaimed: [...] "Wait till you <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> fuckin' next record. It smokes our first album. The shit's twice as technical, three times as heavy." [...] Iowa generally received favorable reviews from music critics. The College Music Journal reviewed it as [...] "brutal, unrelenting, scorching..." [...] Many reviews noted its heavy themes; Alternative Press stated, [...] " [...] like having a plastic bag taped over your head for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag.... is over the top...you're {{going to be left}} in stitches." [...] NME said that it is [...] "Exhilarating, brutal and good." [...] Rolling Stone credited the album for its originality, stating that [...] "nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal." [...] Producer Robinson was also praised for his work on the album; Uncut noted, [...] "The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert." [...] Reviewing for Yahoo, John Mulvey said, [...] "They're an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton {{wrote the}} hymn O God of Earth and Altar which was printed in The Commonwealth and then {{included}} in the English Hymnal in 1906. Several lines of the hymn are sung {{in the beginning of}} the song Revelations by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden on their 1983 album Piece of Mind. Lead singer Bruce Dickinson in an interview stated [...] "I have a fondness for hymns. I love some of the ritual, the beautiful words, Jerusalem and there was another one, with words by G.K. Chesterton O God of Earth and Altar â€“ very fire and brimstone: 'Bow down and <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> cry'. I used that for an Iron Maiden song, Revelations.

"During the U.S. Senate {{trial of}} Timothy Pickering in 1809, on {{the charge of}} the {{embezzlement}} of public funds, White defended him in the words: 'The accused is not in default, but under the awful visitation of God: and, as he is deranged, our proceedings scarcely deserve {{the name of a}} mock trial.' Wilson Cary Nicholas, then congressman from Virginia, called out: 'I will not submit to <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> proceedings called by the name of a mock trial." [...] Whereupon White at once replied: [...] "It is a mock trial, and I am ready to give the gentleman, if he is offended, satisfaction at any time or place.' The sentiment in favor of dueling was so strong at that time that it does not appear on the records {{that the president of the}} senate administered any rebuke to the contestants. Mr. White had a national reputation as a marksman, and performed remarkable feats in shooting." [...] By the time of his last session in the U.S. Congress he was one of only a very few Federalists still in office.|$|E
2500|$|Deaf Havana were {{originally}} a five-piece band, incorporating screaming vocals in their music, as demonstrated on their previous work Meet Me Halfway, at Least. Shortly {{after the release}} of this album, vocalist and founding member Ryan Mellor left the band, citing personal reasons, leaving the group without a screamer. It was decided that Mellor would not be replaced; clean vocalist James Veck-Gilodi would become the sole vocalist and act as the band's frontman. This led to a change in the musical style of the group; they moved away from post-hardcore which had characterised their earlier releases towards pop punk and power pop. A demo track, titled [...] "My Life Is Average", showcasing their new, lighter sound, was uploaded to the band's Myspace page shortly after Ryan's departure. In an interview, Veck-Gilodi explained, 'We didn't want to announce Ryan had left, and then have months off, for people to wonder what we were doing. We wanted to get a song out there with just me singing... so people could <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> new sound'.|$|E

2500|$|The {{release date}} for When Your Heart Stops Beating was heavily {{anticipated}} and publicized {{by the music}} press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006 although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the {{months prior to the}} record's release, such as countless impostors posting fake songs online. [...] "It's kind of flattering that some kids would go out there and post songs under our name," [...] Barker added. [...] "I mean, at least it means that people are excited to <b>hear</b> <b>our</b> stuff." [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News. While it [...] "pained" [...] them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to media, instead burying themselves in the studio in the recording of the album. [...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, and now that the record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "We were silent for a year, and we couldn't put into words what we were doing, so we just decided not to say anything and let the music speak for itself," [...] Barker added. [...] "Now it's time for people to hear that music and hear the truth." ...|$|E

If it hadn't been leaked by someone we probably would've leaked it ourselves". Albarn speculated that the leak helped the reception of their live shows, due to the songs' lyrics being more familiar to the audience.|$|R
