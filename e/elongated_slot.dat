50|$|A Guide Plate, {{also known}} as an auto-blocking belay device, is a metal plate with an <b>elongated</b> <b>slot</b> for the bight to go through and then a {{carabiner}} is attached so that when pull from the climber occurs the carabiner will be pulled to lock off the device.|$|E
50|$|Fitted {{with the}} {{characteristic}} Beretta open slide, the M1934 {{has a very}} reliable feeding and extraction cycle; the <b>elongated</b> <b>slot</b> {{in the top of}} the slide acts as the ejection port. It is made with relatively few parts and very simple to maintain. The M1934 is very robust in construction with a long service life if properly maintained.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2, the {{electric}} field magnitude and direction {{can be determined}} and imaged (Fig.  3 d) by taking the x- and y-components of ICOM data and calculating {{the angle of the}} resultant electric field vector and plotting the direction as a function of color and the intensity as a function of shade (upper inset). From the field image, the characteristic annular shape of the in-plane projected electric field can clearly be seen for the heavy Sc and Dy atomic sites, and also quite clearly for the O-sites bordering the Dy-doublets. Furthermore, the resolution is sufficient to distinguish between the single column Sc atoms, where the inner annulus is circular, and the doublet column of the Dy sites where the inner annulus forms an <b>elongated</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted angle iron) is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, frames, work benches, equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of <b>elongated</b> <b>slots</b> punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
40|$|Data were {{obtained}} for a round jet located {{on the center of}} the bottom of a fuselage and for <b>elongated</b> <b>slots</b> separated spanwise by distances of 0. 8 and 1. 2 of the fuselage width. The effect of yawing the slots, inclining the jets laterally, and combining slot yaw with jet inclination was determined. Data {{were obtained}} in and out of ground effect through a range of effective velocity ratios and through a range of sideslip angles...|$|R
50|$|Free-standing shelf {{frames are}} also usually {{manufactured}} from metal (usually steel), though the shelves {{may be made}} of wood. The metal frames may be formed of slotted angle - steel strips longitudinally pressed into a right-angle or L-shaped section (C- and box-section systems are also used where structures have to carry particularly heavy loads); these sections are perforated with circular holes or <b>elongated</b> <b>slots</b> to allow shelves to be mounted directly or fixed using nuts and bolts. The most heavy duty form of adjustable shelving is pallet racking.|$|R
40|$|<b>Elongated</b> (<b>slotted)</b> holes {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for the integration of equipment into Spacelab racks. In the past, this type of interface has been modeled assuming {{that there is not}} slippage between contact surfaces, or that there is no load transfer {{in the direction of the}} slot. Since the contact surfaces are bolted together, the contact friction provides a load path determined by the normal applied force (bolt preload) and the coefficient of friction. Three alternate methods that utilize spring elements, externally applied couples, and stress dependent elements are examined to model the contacted surfaces. Results of these methods are compared with results obtained from methods that use GAP elements and rigid elements...|$|R
40|$|DE 2930454 A UPAB: 19930915 The coupler uses a pair {{of single}} fibre optical {{conductors}} with curved sections in the coupling zone, mounted next {{to one another in}} a block, with their centres of curvature aligned. The coupler is made using a cylindrical block, one face of which has a central bore (31) and two <b>elongate</b> <b>slots</b> (41, 42) either side of it and with the same width as the bore dia. The block is eccentrically attached to the surface of a second larger disc and U-shaped grooves for locating the optical conductors are provided in its peripheral surface at diametrically opposite points. The block is then split into two symmetrical halves and the optical conductors embedded in the grooves, before attaching the two halves to a mounting plate so that their curved surfaces are face to face...|$|R
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in <b>elongated</b> <b>slots,</b> equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
40|$|The results {{reported}} in this paper describe {{some of the main}} flow characteristics and NOx production results which develop in the mixing process in a constant cross-sectional cylindrical duct. A 3 -dimensional numerical model has been used to predict the mixing flow field and NOx characteristics in a mixing section of an RQL combustor. Eighteen configurations have been analyzed in a circular geometry in a fully reacting environment simulating the operating condition of an actual RQL gas turbine combustion liner. The evaluation matrix was constructed by varying three parameter: (1) jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ration (J), (2) orifice shape or orifice aspect ratio, and (3) slot slant angle. The results indicate that the mixing flow field and NOx production significantly vary with the value of the jet penetration and subsequently, slanting <b>elongated</b> <b>slots</b> generally improve the NOx production at high J conditions. Round orifices produce low NOx at low J due to the strong jet penetration. The NOx production trends do not correlate with the mixing non-uniformity parameters described herein...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} is described {{of some of}} the important parameters affecting the mixing process in a quick mixing region of a rich burn/quick mix/lean burn (RQL) combustor. The performance of the quick mixing region is significantly affected by the geometric designs of both the mixing domain and the jet inlet orifices. Several of the important geometric parameters and operating conditions affecting the mixing process were analytically studied. Parameters such as jet-to-mainstream momentum flux ratio (J), mass flow ratio (MR), orifice geometry, orifice orientation, and number of orifices/row (equally spaced around the circumferential direction were analyzed. Three different sets of orifice shapes were studied: (1) square, (2) <b>elongated</b> <b>slots,</b> and (3) equilateral triangles. Based on the analytical results, the best mixing configuration depends significantly on the penetration depth of the jet to prevent the hot mainstream flow from being entrained behind the orifice. The structure in a circular mixing section is highly weighted toward the outer wall and any mixing structure affecting this area significantly affects the overall results. The {{increase in the number of}} orifices per row increases the mixing at higher J conditions. Higher slot slant angles and aspect ratios are generally the best mixing configurations at higher momentum flux ratio (J) conditions. However, the square and triangular shaped orifices were more effective mixing configurations at lower J conditions...|$|R
40|$|A surface replica-based crack {{inspection}} {{method has}} recently been developed for use in Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) hydrogen feedline flowliners. These flowliners exist to ensure favorable flow of liquid hydrogen over gimble joint bellows, and consist of two rings each containing 38 <b>elongated</b> <b>slots.</b> In the summer of 2002, multiple cracks ranging from 0. 1 inches to 0. 6 inches long were discovered; each orbiter contained at least one cracked flowliner. These long cracks were repaired and eddy current inspections ensured that no cracks longer than 0. 075 inches were present. However, subsequent fracture-mechanics review of flight rationale required detection of smaller cracks, and was the driving force for development of higher-resolution inspection method. Acetate tape surface replicas {{have been used for}} decades to detect and monitor small cracks. However, acetate tape replicas have primarily been limited to laboratory specimens because complexities involved in making these replicas - requiring acetate tape to be dissolved with acetone - are not well suited for a crack inspection tool. More recently developed silicon-based replicas are better suited for use as a crack detection tool. A commercially available silicon-based replica product has been determined to be acceptable for use in SSME hydrogen feedlines. A method has been developed using this product and a scanning electron microscope for analysis, which can find cracks as small as 0. 005 inches and other features (e. g., pits, scratches, tool marks, etc.) as small as 0. 001 inches. The resolution of this method has been validated with dozens of cracks generated in a laboratory setting and this method has been used to locate 55 cracks (ranging in size from 0. 040 inches to 0. 004 inches) on space flight hardware. These cracks were removed by polishing away the cracked material and a second round of replicas confirmed the repair...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{mixing of}} cold lateral jets with hot cross-stream flows in {{confined}} configurations is of practical interest in gas turbine combustors as it strongly affects combustor exit temperature quality, and gaseous emissions in for example rich-lean combustion. It is therefore important to further improve our fundamental {{understanding of the}} important processes of dilution jet mixing especially when the injected jet mass flow rate exceeds that of the cross-stream. The results reported in this report describe {{some of the main}} flow characteristics which develop in the mixing process in a cylindrical duct. A 3 -dimensional tool has been used to predict the mixing flow field characteristics and NOx emission in a quench section of an RQL combustor, Eighteen configurations have been analyzed in a circular geometry in a fully reacting environment simulating the operating condition of an actual RQL gas turbine combustion liner. The evaluation matrix was constructed by varying three parameters: 1) jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratio (J), 2) orifice shape or orifice aspect ratio, and 3) slot slant angle. The results indicate that the mixing flow field significantly varies with the value of the jet penetration and subsequently, slanting <b>elongated</b> <b>slots</b> generally improve the mixing uniformity at high J conditions. Round orifices produce more uniform mixing and low NO(x) emissions at low J due to the strong and adequate jet penetration. No significant correlation was found between the NO(x) production rates and the mixing deviation parameters, however, strong correlation was found between NO(x) formation and jet penetration. In the computational results, most of the NO(x) formation occurred behind the orifice starting at the orifice wake region. Additional NO(x) is formed upstream of the orifice in certain configurations with high J conditions due to the upstream recirculation...|$|R
