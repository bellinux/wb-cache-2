50|$|Parts {{cleaning}} {{is essential}} to many industrial processes, {{as a prelude to}} surface finishing or to protect sensitive components. Electroplating is particularly sensitive to part cleanliness, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. ASTM B322 is a standard guide for cleaning metals prior to electroplating. Cleaning processes include solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, <b>electrocleaning,</b> and acid etch. The most common industrial test for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. Hydrophobic contaminants such as oils cause the water to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are hydrophilic and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes a version of this test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but the electroplating process can displace these easily since the solutions are water-based. Surfactants such as soap reduce the sensitivity of the test, so these must be thoroughly rinsed off.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} pulse {{frequency}} and current density {{on the effectiveness}} of biphasic pulse <b>electrocleaning</b> is discussed. Moderate frequency (5 Hz) is found to be more effective than lower or higher frequency on steel surface cleanliness. A novel interpretation of cyclic voltammagrams is used to estimate the surface cleanliness. This correlates very well with XPS determination of surface carbon levels. This result is discussed in terms of mechanisms of <b>electrocleaning.</b> Moderate frequency (5 â€“ 10 Hz) is more effective than lower frequency for inhibiting hydrogen permeation. This method can prevent hydrogen brittleness on the <b>electrocleaning</b> high-strength steel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{scope of}} this work is to create {{different}} biologically active monolayers on gold thin film electrodes applying Self Assembled Monolayer (SAM) technology and to characterize them with electrochemical methods like Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Three monolayer structures applying different methods {{that are used to}} gain better probe orientation were created and compared according to hybridization with complementary target DNA chains in two different lengths. An <b>electrocleaning</b> protocol to gain high quality electrode surfaces without the need of chemical cleaning reagents and a procedure to qualitatively monitor bioreceptor surfaces with good reproducibility were investigated. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of novel reagents and approaches for generating recyclable biosensors. The use of aqueous media {{for the formation of}} protein binding alkylthiolate monolayers on Au surfaces results in accelerated alkylthiolate monolayer formation and improvement in monolayer integrity as visualized by fluorescence microscopy and CV techniques. We have also developed an <b>electrocleaning</b> protocol that is compatible with microfluidics devices, and this technique serves as an on-chip method for cleaning Au substrates both before and after monolayer formation. The techniques for the formation and dissociation of biotinylated SAMs from aqueous solvents reported here may be applied towards {{the development of}} Au-based sensor devices and microfluidics chips in the future. A potential use of these devices includes the specific capture and triggered release of target cells, proteins, or small molecules from liquid samples...|$|E
