25|$|Of {{those who}} {{do believe that the}} Internet {{promotes}} social capital, a longitudinal study in Pittsburgh found that Internet usage increased rates of <b>individual</b> <b>participation</b> in community activities as well as levels of trust. Additionally, these increased levels of involvement were greater for participants who had previously been the least involved. Of those who use the Internet in the United States, studies have found that these individuals tend to be members of community social networks, participate in community activities, and exhibit higher levels of political participation.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} 227 {{undergraduate}} and graduate students enrolled in web-enabled courses at the Naval War College (NWC) and a public university found that social loafing not only exists, but may also be prevalent in the online learning classroom. Although only 2% of NWC and 8% of public university students self-reported social loafing, 8% of NWC and 77% of public university students indicated the perception of others engaging in social loafing. Additional findings generally verify face-to-face social loafing findings from previous studies. The researchers conclude that injustice {{in the distribution of}} rewards increases social loafing, and suggest that self-perceived dominance negatively affects <b>individual</b> <b>participation</b> in group activities.|$|E

25|$|In the lead-up to World War II in 1939, King affirmed Canadian {{autonomy}} {{by saying}} that the Canadian Parliament would make the final decision on the issue of going to war. He reassured the pro-British Canadians that Parliament would surely decide that Canada would be at Britain's side if Great Britain was drawn into a major war. At the same time, he reassured those who were suspicious of British influence in Canada by promising that Canada would not participate in British colonial wars. His Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, promised French-Canadians that the government would not introduce conscription; <b>individual</b> <b>participation</b> would be voluntary. In 1939, in a country which had seemed deeply divided, these promises made it possible for Parliament to agree almost unanimously to declare war.|$|E

[...] According to Dator, the organizational structure of the Soka Gakkai, which values <b>individual</b> <b>participation</b> within small heterogeneous groups and parallel peer associations by age, gender, and interests, fulfills members' socio-psychological needs.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known and oldest {{distinction}} between Open and Exclusive assemblies {{is in the}} nature of relationships among their local churches. Open Brethren assemblies function as networks of like-minded independent local churches. Exclusive Brethren are generally connectional and so feel under obligation to recognize and adhere to the disciplinary actions of other associated assemblies. Disciplinary action normally involves denying the <b>individual</b> <b>participation</b> in the breaking of bread or Lord's table. Generally, this is a Sunday morning service of prayer, singing, teaching, and taking communion, with important assembly-related announcements given at the end. Exclusion from it is a major issue.|$|E

However, gradually also Fal was getting convinced that the regency was a burden rather than an asset. There were almost no calls to terminate it as initially envisioned by Alfonso Carlos, i.e. by staging a grand Carlist assembly, {{and there are no}} signs that Don Javier contemplated such an option; almost all voices called for him simply to assume monarchic rights himself. During the 1950 tour across Vascongadas and 1951 one across Levante he still tried to maintain low profile, but in 1952 Don Javier decided to bow to the pressure, apparently against his own will and considering it another cross to bear. During the Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona he published a document, styled as a letter to his son; it referred to [...] "assumption of royalty in succession of the last king", though also to pending [...] "promulgation at the nearest opportunity" [...] and with no mention about the regency.|$|E

We found that being an urban dweller increases the odds of participating in formal vocational training. It may be indicative of lack of proper vocational training facilities in the rural areas. Further, being male increases the odds of receiving vocational training, implying that certain special interventions are required to encourage the girls to enrol in formal vocational training programmes.|$|R
