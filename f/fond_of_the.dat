5|$|As China {{entered the}} early modern period, the I Ching took on renewed {{relevance}} in both Confucian and Daoist study. The Kangxi Emperor was especially <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I Ching and ordered new interpretations of it. Qing dynasty scholars focused more intently on understanding pre-classical grammar, assisting {{the development of new}} philological approaches in the modern period.|$|E
5|$|Bewick was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{music of}} Northumberland, {{and of the}} Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. He {{especially}} wanted to promote the Northumbrian smallpipes, and to support the piper John Peacock, so he encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters {{of this kind of}} music. One of these pupils was Thomas's son, Robert, whose surviving manuscript tunebooks give a picture of a piper's repertoire in the 1820s.|$|E

5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters, and he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant was a family-owned American-style steakhouse {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB's Lounge. The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas' family. Though Thomas was not particularly <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name of the business Blake had established in 1960, {{he was unable to}} afford new signage and kept the lounge's title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the landlord's death.|$|E

50|$|During this period, a {{fair amount}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microfilms <b>of</b> {{historical}} sources {{dating back to the}} 13th to 19th centuries and of great significance to Lithuania (including the Lithuanian Metrica) were added to <b>the</b> <b>fonds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archives. They were previously kept in Latvia, Poland, Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine. A growing number of documents were being published and presented to the public. After the former secret fonds were declassified and starting with 1989, all documents were made accessible to researchers.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|Postmaster General James Farley {{occupied}} two adjoining suites in {{the current}} Waldorf Astoria during his tenure {{as the chairman of}} the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there until he died in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidential Suite.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket launchers {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of 5,500 metres (3.4mi). But the artillery branch was not <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Katyusha, because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.|$|E

50|$|Florent Couao-Zotti (born 1964) is {{a writer}} of comics, plays, and short stories, who lives in Cotonou, Benin. He is <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> {{employing}} <b>the</b> short-story as a form. He is also editor of several satirical magazines and a cultural columnist.|$|R
5|$|The name durian {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is very <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larvae of tree-boring beetles, {{such as the}} {{longhorn beetle}} Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|To {{tell the}} truth, I wasn't all that <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damned thing by then, {{but it had}} become a symbol for the men of the 8th Wing. I knew McConnell understood. During his visits to Ubon over the past year he had never {{referred}} to my breach of military standards, just seemed rather amused at the variety of 'staches sported by many of the troops. (It) was the most direct order I had received in twenty-four years of service.|$|E
