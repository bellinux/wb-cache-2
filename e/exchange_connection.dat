5000|$|In {{addition}} to the remote control features (screen-sharing), Timbuktu also allows for file transfers, system profiling, voice and text chat, and remote activity notifications. Timbuktu versions 5.1 and earlier initiate connections over UDP port 407, though versions 5.2 and later use TCP port 407. [...] The program has integrated support for Secure Shell (ssh) tunneling for those who require additional security. Both the Mac and Windows versions can use a standalone user database or integrate with the respective platform's [...] "standard" [...] user database (OpenDirectory on the Mac, and Active Directory or NT Users on Windows). The 8.6 version, released in March 2006, added an optional integration with Skype to enable a user to remote-control any of their Skype contacts who have Timbuktu installed. Starting with the 8.6 version, Timbuktu has been released as a Universal Binary supporting both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs. The 8.8 version, released in September 2009, added support for Mac OS X v10.6, although the ability to receive clicks with modifier keys broke {{with the release of}} Mac OS X v10.6.3 (March 2010). Version 8.8.2, released November 2010, resolved the Control session mouse-click modifier key issues as well as <b>Exchange</b> <b>connection</b> performance issues. Version 8.8.3, released in 2011, made Timbuktu compatible with Mac OS X Lion. Version 8.8.4, released in 2012, made Timbuktu compatible with Mac OS X Mountain Lion, resolving a screen rendering issue. [...] Version 8.8.5 for Mac, released in October 2013, made Timbuktu compatible with Mac OS X 10.9 [...] "Mavericks".|$|E

Educational workshops inspired by Paulo Freire’s ideas on critical pedagogy were delivered to 82 community health agents in three Brazilian cities. The workshops utilized evocative objects to link and develop participants’ conceptual and experiential knowledge. The participants <b>exchanged</b> <b>connections</b> and experiences and created hypothetical action plans to be implemented in collaboration with community members.
