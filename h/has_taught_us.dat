500|$|Meanwhile, Solidarity {{had been}} {{transforming}} itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a revolutionary movement. Over the 500 {{days following the}} Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union (Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych [...] "Solidarność" [...] or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union. It {{was the only time}} in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. [...] "History <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> that there is no bread without freedom," [...] the Solidarity program stated a year later. [...] "What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic." [...] Tygodnik Solidarność, a Solidarity-published newspaper, was started in April 1981.|$|E
500|$|Soon after South Carolina {{pretended to}} secession from the Union in 1861 and began their insurrection, Holmes began {{publishing}} pieces—the {{first of which}} was the patriotic song [...] "A Voice of the Loyal North"—in support of the Union cause. Although he had previously criticized the abolitionists, deeming them traitorous, his main concern was for the preservation of the Union. In September of that year, he published an article titled [...] "Bread and Newspapers" [...] in the Atlantic, in which he proudly identified himself as an ardent Unionist. He wrote, [...] "War <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us,</b> as nothing else could, what we can be and are" [...] and inspiring even the upper class to have [...] "courage... big enough for the uniform which hangs so loosely about their slender figures." [...] Holmes also had a personal stake in the war: his oldest son, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., enlisted in the Army against his father's wishes in April 1861 and was injured three times in battle, including a gunshot wound in his chest at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas said that, in his view, [...] "a State's use {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause." [...] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who concluded that [...] "he way to stop {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." [...] Concurring, Thomas wrote that [...] "if our history <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> anything, it <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> to beware of elites bearing racial theories," [...] and charged that the dissent carried [...] "similarities" [...] to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education. In Grutter v. Bollinger, he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's Plessy v. Ferguson dissent: [...] "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." [...] In a concurrence in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court [...] "has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority." ...|$|E

2500|$|A major {{precedent}} {{was formed}} {{on the use}} of linguistic profiling in the case of Sanchez v. People. A witness testified against a suspect based on his overhearing of an argument between two apparent Spanish speakers where the killer was identified as having a Dominican rather than a Puerto Rican accent. The New York Superior Court ruled that distinguishing between accents was permissible {{based on the fact that}} [...] "human experience <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> to discern the variation in the mode of speech of certain individuals." [...] The court found that a certain degree of familiarity with the accents and dialects of a region or ethnic group qualified an individual to identify ethnicity or race in a court based on auditory evidence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} majority opinion Justice Clarence Thomas restated his view, in agreement with Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, that the Constitution is [...] "color-blind." [...] For Thomas, this means that no {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is permitted by the Constitution, even for a so-called [...] "benign" [...] purpose (Thomas rejected the notion that there could be a purely benign purpose in his concurrence in Adarand because the benignity or malignity of race-based discrimination turns on [...] "whose ox is being gored" [...] or is [...] "in the eye of the beholder"). [...] Justice Thomas also rejected the view advanced by the dissent that these school districts were in danger of resegregation. [...] He contended that whatever trends toward classroom racial imbalance have obtained, they were not the result of state-sanctioned segregation as in the pre-Brown era. Justice Thomas goes on to call out the dissent for adopting segregationist reasoning advanced in Brown, particularly its insistence that the Court should defer to local school board knowledge, expertise, and judgment. [...] He also wrote about the unsettled debate concerning whether racial balance or diversity has a positive effect on educational outcomes. [...] Justice Thomas recoils at the suggestion that black students can only learn if they are sitting next to white students. [...] Some of the concurrence consists of social science citations and statistics showing that black students can succeed in majority black schools such as HBCUs. [...] Justice Thomas concludes noting [...] "If our history <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> anything it <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> to beware of elites bearing racial theories." [...] In a footnote the Justice added a personal mention of Justice Breyer: [...] "Justice Breyer's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer's tenure." [...] He goes on to explain that he is skeptical that school boards will always have such good intentions in their race-based decisionmaking, for, as Madison said, [...] "if men were angels, no government would be necessary." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> a great deal, {{but the main}} point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored.

But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time… ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} surrounding Perpessicius' contributions as chronicler and theorist emerged during his lifetime, centered on perceptions {{that he was}} neither polemically engaged nor a proponent of hierarchies, but that he preferred to write equidistantly. Contrary to his contemporaries, Perpessicius believed {{the work of a}} critic to be not the imposition of a direction, but the [...] "registry office" [...] and panorama of naturally occurring trends, an idea notably present in the title of his article În tinda unei registraturi ("In the Parlor of a Registry Office"). The text spoke in favor of diversity and against [...] "sectarianism": [...] "I shall weed out [...] any sectarian prejudice and shall strive to comment on any work", because [...] "the critic would do better not to consider novelty a scarecrow." [...] Elsewhere, he cited Thibaudet for having inspired in him [...] "great comprehension" [...] and the ideal of [...] "plurality in tastes". In a 1962 interview with Luceafărul, Perpessicius stated: [...] "young writers [...] should have the habit of reading the critics, but should not obey their assessments blindly. Just as there are writers who request any verdict, no matter how severe, {{as long as it is}} sincere, there are those pompous critics, who have never doubted the justness of their verdicts.

Add to that he has quietly been a fixture in the tech world for many years: attending major conferences both as a keynote and audience member, making him a sought-after promotional partner, advisor and potential investor. It was in this capacity that he met Upfront partner, Mark Suster, in 2009, becoming one of the earliest co-investors in Maker Studios, now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company."
