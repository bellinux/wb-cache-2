5|$|Howe {{worked to}} place the government-dominated Canadian National Railways (CNR) on a sound {{financial}} basis. He introduced legislation to form the CNR into a crown corporation. Although the opposition complained that Howe was becoming power mad, they had little quarrel with the proposed reorganization itself, and it was passed <b>into</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> June 1936, Howe brought in legislation to establish another crown corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which passed into law with little debate or opposition.|$|E

5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 1906, resulting {{in the creation of the}} Food and Drug Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|Garrow {{also became}} {{involved}} in the repeal of the Corn Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass <b>into</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow {{was one of those who}} found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, talk {{started on the}} {{construction}} of a bridge to cross the Mississippi River at Greenville. In 1936, a group called the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that time) worked with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938, and construction started on the bridge a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Pennington {{assigned}} Sherman {{to serve}} {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Ways and Means, where he spent much of his time on appropriations bills, while cooperating with his colleague Justin Smith Morrill on the passage of {{what became known as the}} Morrill Tariff. The Morrill Tariff raised duties on imports to close the deficit that had resulted from falling revenues. It also had the effect of encouraging domestic industries, which appealed to the former Whigs in the Republican party. Sherman spoke in favor of the bill, and it passed the House by a vote of 105 to 64. The tariff bill would likely have died in the Senate, but the withdrawal of Southern members at the start of the Civil War allowed the rump Senate to pass the bill in the 36th Congress's final session, and President Buchanan signed it <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> February 1861. Likewise, Sherman supported a bill admitting Kansas as a free state that passed in 1861.|$|E

5|$|SSH9E was {{extended}} southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to {{a branch of}} PSH21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and {{was extended}} across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. SR104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and was signed <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 1970. The Hood Canal Bridge, officially named after William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 windstorm {{and was replaced by}} a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South PointLofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes.|$|E
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was created}} in 1930 out of {{the southern end of}} US127. Three sets of reroutings through Adrian have resulted in the creation of two different business loops through the city. A change proposed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s shifted the southern end of US223 to replace M-151 and then run along the US23 freeway between Whiteford Township, Michigan, and Sylvania, Ohio. Since the 1980s, US223 no longer reaches Toledo, instead feeding into the freeway system for the city. Changes proposed and enacted <b>into</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s would upgrade the highway as an Interstate Highway. Congress has designated this corridor as part of Interstate 73 (I-73), although neither state intends at this time to complete the freeway.|$|E

5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it <b>into</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E
