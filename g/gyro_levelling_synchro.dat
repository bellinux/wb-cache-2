2500|$|Example: Sending [...] "Junk Synchron" [...] (Level 3 Tuner Monster) and [...] "Speed Warrior" [...] (Level 2) {{from the}} field to the {{graveyard}} allows the player to special summon [...] "Junk Warrior" [...] (<b>Level</b> 5 <b>Synchro</b> Monster).|$|R
50|$|On a {{practical}} <b>level,</b> <b>synchros</b> resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.|$|R
5000|$|The FKC {{received}} {{vertical reference}} {{information from a}} <b>Gyro</b> <b>Level</b> Corrector and aircraft altitude, range, direction, and speed input information from the Rangefinder-Director, and output to the guns the elevation and deflection data needed to hit the target, along with the correct fuze timing information, so that the shells fired would explode {{in the vicinity of}} the target aircraft. Most guns controlled by the FKC had Fuze Setting Pedestals or Fuze Setting Trays where the correct fuze timing was set on a clockwork mechanism within the AA shell warhead.|$|R
5000|$|Only the RN and USN {{achieved}} 'blindfire' radar fire-control, with {{no need to}} visually {{acquire the}} opposing vessel. The Axis powers all lacked this capability. Classes such as Iowa and South Dakota could lob shells over visual horizon, in darkness, through smoke or weather. American systems, in common with many contemporary major navies, had Gyroscopic stable vertical elements, so they could keep a solution on a target even during maneuvers. By the start of World War II British, German and American warships could both shoot and maneuver using sophisticated analog fire-control computers that incorporated Gyro compass and <b>Gyro</b> <b>Level</b> inputs. [...] Off Cape Matapan the British Mediterranean Fleet using radar ambushed and mauled an Italian fleet, although actual fire was under optical control using starshell. At the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal the , in complete darkness, inflicted fatal damage on the battleship [...] {{using a combination of}} optical and radar fire-control; comparisons between optical and radar tracking, during the battle, showed that radar tracking matched optical tracking in accuracy, while radar ranges were used throughout the battle.|$|R
50|$|Like {{any other}} {{discipline}} of figure skating, {{there are many}} different levels at which synchronized skaters can compete. These <b>levels</b> include: <b>synchro</b> skills (1, 2 or 3), preliminary, pre-juvenile, open-juvenile, juvenile, intermediate, novice, junior, senior, open collegiate, collegiate, open adult, open masters, masters and adult. Synchronized skating uses the same judging system as singles, pairs and ice dancing. The discipline is primarily judged on skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, interpretation and difficulty of elements. What makes the sport so unique is the incredible teamwork, speed, and intricate formations.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} and demonstrated for estimating single-axis <b>gyro</b> noise <b>levels</b> {{in terms of}} the Farrenkopf model parameters. This is accomplished for the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) by comparing gyro-propagated attitudes with less accurate single-frame solutions and fitting the squared differences to a third-order polynomial in time. Initial results are consistent with the gyro specifications, and these results are used to determine limits on the duration of batches used to determine attitude. Sources of error are discussed, and guidelines for a more elegant implementation, as part of a batch estimator or filter, are included for future work...|$|R
2500|$|Introduced {{with the}} Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's anime series. A monster that is summoned from the Extra Deck {{by sending a}} [...] "Tuner" [...] type monster and one or more non-Tuner monsters from the field to the graveyard, whose total levels equal the <b>level</b> of the <b>Synchro</b> Monster you wish to summon. Under normal conditions, only one Tuner Monster can be used per Synchro Summoning (that is to say, a player cannot perform a Synchro Summon using only Tuner Monsters). Some Synchro Monsters may require certain types of monster {{to be used as}} Synchro material.|$|R
40|$|The command {{handling}} {{approach as}} applied to fine guidance sensor guide star acquisition is described in order to illustrate the flexibility it provides to users of the Space Telescope. User control of pointing operations is detailed, and the pointing control system/fine guidance system interface is depicted along with the guide star acquisition sequence. Reaction wheel interaction with vehicle structural modes and the rate <b>gyro</b> assembly noise <b>level</b> are discussed and some test data are shown...|$|R
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of the SABS compared to similar devices like the Norden was the automatic [...] "erection" [...] system. Gyroscopes have no preferred direction of rotation and will hold whatever angle they initially started up in. In the Norden, adjusting the gyros to an absolute [...] "up" [...] required a time consuming operation that could {{take as long as}} eight minutes. The SABS solved this with a pendulum mechanism consisting of a weight on the end of an L-shaped bracket. The weight caused the bracket to be pulled vertically, and if the <b>gyro</b> was not <b>level,</b> the bracket pressed {{against the side of the}} gyro's shaft, forcing it in the appropriate direction.|$|R
2500|$|In its {{original}} incarnation in Kazuki Takahashi's Yu-Gi-Oh! manga series, Duel Monsters, originally known as Magic & Wizards, {{had a rather}} basic structure, not featuring many of the restricting rules introduced later on and often featuring peculiar exceptions to the rulings {{in the interest of}} providing a more engrossing story. Beginning with the Battle City arc of the manga and Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime series, more structured rules such as tribute requirements were introduced to the story, with the series falling more in line with the rules of the real life card-game by the time its spin-off series began. From the Duel Monsters anime onwards, characters use cards which resemble their real life counterparts, though some monsters or effects differ between that of the real life trading card game and the manga and anime's Duel Monsters, with some cards created exclusively for those mediums. Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's featured an anime-original card type known as Dark Synchro, which involved using [...] "Dark Tuners" [...] to summon Dark Synchro Monsters with negative <b>levels.</b> Dark <b>Synchro</b> cards were featured in the PlayStation Portable video game, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4, while Dark Synchro Monsters featured in the anime were released as standard Synchro Monsters in the real-life game. Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V features Action Cards, spell and trap cards that are picked up in the series' unique Action Duels, which are not possible to perform in the real life game. In the film , an exclusive form of summoning known as Dimension Summoning is featured. This method allows players to freely summon a monster by deciding how many ATK or DEF points it has, but they receive damage equal to that amount when the monster is destroyed.|$|R

40|$|Observations are {{presented}} of lunar occultations {{of the earth}} at 250 kHz obtained with the Radio-Astronomy-Explorer- 2 satellite which were used to derive two dimensional maps of {{the location of the}} sources of terrestrial kilometric radiation (TKR). By examining the two dimensional source distributions {{as a function of the}} observer's location (lunar orbit) with respect to the magnetosphere, the average three dimensional location of the emission regions can be estimated. Although TKR events at 250 kHz can often be observed at projected distances corresponding to the 250 kHz electron <b>gyro</b> or plasma <b>level</b> (approximately 2 earth radii), many events are observed much farther from the earth (between 5 and 15 earth radii). Dayside emission apparently in the region of the polar cusp and the magnetosheath and night emission associated with regions of the magnetotail are examined. The nightside emission is suggestive of a mechanism involving plasma sheet electron precipitation in the pre-midnight sector...|$|R
