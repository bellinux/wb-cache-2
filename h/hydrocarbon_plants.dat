50|$|Most <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>plants</b> are not trees, however, so this {{technique}} of tapping {{the tree is}} no longer feasible. Instead of tapping thetree, the hydrocarbons are extracted using various organic solvents. This process is especially useful with single-cell algae, suchas Botryococcus braunii. This algae has two forms, both of which live in brackish water. The first form is a red algae thatproduces odd-numbered carbon chains roughly 25-31 atoms inlength. These carbon chains usually do not possess {{a large number of}} double bonds. Thesecond type of Botryococcus braunii is green and produces even-numbered carbon chains that are between 34 and 38 carbons long, withmany double bonds present. While the cause of this difference is not well-studied, the two different algae can be used for discretepurposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>plants</b> are {{plants that}} follow certain {{metabolic}} pathways that produce hydrocarbon products similar to petroleum. Thesehydrocarbon products are called terpenoids. The plants that produce terpenoids in large enough quantitiesto be harvested {{can be as}} big as trees or as small as single-cell algae. The Euphorbiaceae family has been studied in detail byDr. Melvin Calvin, Nobel Laureate, and discoverer of the Calvin Cycle.One particular tree, the Hevea tree, or more commonly known as the rubber tree, is probably the most famous hydrocarbon plant,supplying an estimated one third of the world’s rubber demand. It is still not as quick and cheap to make as petroleum-based rubber,hence why it does not occupy a larger portion of themarket. The Hevea tree naturally produces a latex substance which can tapped bycutting into the tree, and the latex can then be processed into rubber.|$|E

In order to obtain retrofit schemes that offer significant energy saving potential and are easy to implement, heat integration strategies are also developed in this study. Two case studies based on an aniline plant and an aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>plant,</b> each one comprising several processing units, are presented to illustrate the application of these principles and strategies. The boundary for heat integration in each plant can be the whole plant or its individual processing units, the choice of which is determined by their energy saving potentials.

Both thermochemolysis and spectroscopy indicated that polysaccharides, alkyl, cyclic, and aromatic compounds were the predominant components of HA, the stable fraction of compost. NMR dipolar dephasing (DD) experiments confirmed that HA extracts contained lignin in lower amount than its oxidized degradation products.

In continental ecosystems chlorides act as source of chlorine, and also as a stress factor. Chlorides originate from precipitation of marine cloud masses.

Volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VOCl) represent one group of organically bound chlorines. Several volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons reacts with atmospheric ozone, consequently causing depletion of the ozone layer.
