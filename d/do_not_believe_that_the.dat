For my part, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, {{there is still a}} significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E

5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Christ; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Son of God; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Word of the Father; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the author of the world; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if Moses could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it? In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exodus 3, 13-15)(Augustine on the Gospel of St. John) (Gilson, p. 85) ...|$|R

25|$|The Zaidi {{doctrine}} of Imamah does not presuppose the infallibility of the imam nor that the Imams receive divine guidance. Zaidis also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Imamate must pass from father to son but believe {{it can be}} held by any Sayyid descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case {{after the death of}} Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.|$|E
25|$|The skeletons {{within the}} {{enclosure}} of the lion monument are generally accepted {{to be the}} remains of the Sacred Band, as the number given by Plutarch was probably an approximation. However, historians such as Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Karl Julius Beloch, and Vincenzo Costanzi <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip's lifetime with such a massive and obviously expensive monument.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{believe that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include the {{problems}} of processing, transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong; {{and there have been}} serious nuclear accidents. Critics <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology. In years past, they also argued that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
