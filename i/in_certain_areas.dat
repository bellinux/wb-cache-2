The marginal walking distance to bus stop is a basic parameter to estimate bus service coverage <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>area.</b> And the marginal walking distance could be transformed from the marginal walking time, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. The result of analysis revealed that the age and income of passenger are strongly related to the marginal walking time.

The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E

Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
