40|$|In this work, {{a steady}} state {{simulation}} of a fertilizer granulation circuit is developed {{in order to}} study strategies for reducing the recycle ratio and improving circuit control. A two-stage population balance model for the continuous <b>granulation</b> <b>drum</b> is developed. This {{is based on an}} experimentally observed mechanism of granulation. Models developed for the screen and crusher units are validated against data from an operating granulation plant. Unit models are then used to develop a steady state simulation of the entire granulation circuit. Several case studies are performed to illustrate the effect of changing granulation model parameters, crusher and screen operating characteristics on circuit performance. Recycle ratio goes through a minimum as liquid content in the <b>granulation</b> <b>drum</b> increases. Operation is very sensitive near the liquid content where a second stage of granulation, which broadens the granule size distribution, begins. Multiple steady states are observed under some conditions, these are related to variations in granule porosity with recycle granule size distribution. A reduction in binder viscosity or <b>granulation</b> <b>drum</b> residence time improves circuit stability. Circuit operation is very sensitive to the efficiency of the crushing and screening station. Efficient crushing reduces recycle ratios at high liquid content and also improves circuit stability. A reduction in screen efficiency causes a large increase in the minimum obtainable recycle ratio...|$|E

In this case, the granule is mainly formed by agglomeration through salt bridges [44].|$|E
30|$|Less efficient, {{but still}} beneficial, humic–NPK {{compound}} fertilizers {{can be obtained}} when applying humate solutions during the granulation process on the mass—normally—into the <b>granulation</b> <b>drum</b> [9, 38]. In this case, reaction conditions are milder than those involved in RCF or CSP manufacture, and chemical bonds between HS and nutrients are weaker that those involved in RCF and CSP matrices [38]. Humic–NPK compound fertilizers produced in this way have shown higher efficiency than ordinary NPK compound fertilizers [9, 38]. These effects were mainly related {{to the ability of}} HA to improve nutrient fertilizer availability since normally the active HA dose per ha applied with NPK granules is too low for developing HA-DE mediated effects on plant crops. Indeed, Chen and Aviad [4] calculated that around 75  kg per ha of HA is needed to have consistent biostimulant effects on field crops. This means that the manufacture of a compound NPK fertilizer contains at least 20  % of potentially active HA in the formula, when the NPK fertilizer dose used is 400  kg per ha. Although very expensive, this fertilizer can be prepared by adding HA as a raw material for granulation. However, the above-explained extreme conditions of temperature, and principally, pH within the <b>granulation</b> <b>drum</b> as well as the presence of polyvalent cations in the solution of granulation (Ca++ for instance), normally lead to HA precipitation and insolubility. This fact, in turn, implies a significant potential loss in agronomical efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Biochar {{has shown}} {{potential}} as a soil amendment, but is a fine powder {{that is difficult to}} handle and would be blown away if applied to soils without modifications. Wet <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> of cornstalk biochar using binder solutions of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was initially investigated, establishing that biochar could be granulated into a form that would be easier to handle and apply effectively to the soil. Biochars from three different feedstocks were then tested along with three binder solutions. The biochar granules were free flowing and relatively strong with a significant yield between a size range of 1 to 4 mm. The binder concentration, total binder solution volume and drum rotational speed affected both the optimal granule size yield and granule strength to different extents depending on the biochar and binder combination. The research showed that biochar could be granulated using wet <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> with adjustment of process parameters to ensure production of granules with specified properties...|$|R

Additionally, different liquid jet breakup and different residual moisture of the bed were applied in the tests. The process was conducted periodically in two stages: wetting and proper granulation, during which no liquid was supplied to the bed. The condition of the granulated material after the period of wetting (particle size distribution and moisture of separate fractions) and a change in the particle size distribution during the further conduct of the process (granulation kinetics) were determined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of particle size distribution on the mechanical properties of granular sulphur and its relation to silo blockage at South Pars Gas Complex Phases 2 & 3. Solid elemental sulphur is a relatively hard, friable crystalline material that tends to break up into smaller particles when subjected to force or stress of any magnitude. Conglomeration of the dust so produced clogs storage silos, making truck loading difficult. Grain size selection is based on the “friability value ” and “maximum entropy ” for granules in a static state. The model of the behavior of confined granular sulphur is based on the principle of continuum mechanics. Granules were formed by feeding liquid sulphur and water to a rotating <b>granulation</b> <b>drum.</b> Sample granules were classified into different size fractions (300 µm – 4. 75 mm) by sieve analysis, and friability tests were done by the Fines 28 -inch tumbler S 5 - 77 test. Friability and granule size data collected over four years were studied. The implication of field analysis and laboratory tests is that the granule size should be controlled during sulphur solidification while ensuring that only granular material with the correct mechanical characteristics is stored in the silo and shipped...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{moisture}} content, {{particle size distribution}} and binder properties on the granulation of ammonium sulphate (AS), monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) were investigated using experiments carried out in a 0. 31 m diameter laboratory <b>granulation</b> <b>drum.</b> Broad initial size distributions were used to simulate recycle size distributions in operating granulation circuits. Granulation extent increases with the available solution phase for a given fertilizer salt. However, differences in granulation extent for different salts cannot be explained by their differences in solubility alone. Other properties of the solution phase binder, especially viscosity, are also important. At low moisture content and for low binder viscosity (MAP), an equilibrium size distribution is reached in less than 5 min. At higher moisture contents and binder viscosities (DAP), granulation continues up to at least 15 min before equilibrium size distribution is reached. The initial size distribution has a strong and complex effect on the granulation process. This extent of granulation goes through a maximum as the proportion of fine (minus 1 mm) in the initial size distribution increases. This effect is attributed to the changes in granule porosity and deformability. A two-stage granulation mechanism is proposed based on the analysis of granulation regimes given by Ennis. In the first stage (non-inertial regime), successful coalescence is independent of particle sizes. An equilibrium granule size distribution is quickly attained. In the second stage (inertial regime), at higher moisture contents, preferential coalescence predominates, leading to a significant growth of the large granules. The size distribution is subsequently widened. This mechanism {{is consistent with the}} experimental results. The analysis of granulation regimes given by Ennis successfully explains the effects of process parameters (liquid content, binder viscosity and initial size distribution) on the extent of granulation and the shape of the granule size distributions...|$|E
30|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>granulation</b> {{of three}} {{different}} formulations for pot trials were carried out. Urea was ground into a powder and hand-mixed in weight ratios urea to wet coal of 1 : 3 (i.e. high N urea-brown coal blend, hereafter referred to as UBC-H) and 1 : 10 (low N urea-brown coal blend, UBC-L). A third formulation contained no urea. Some additional water {{was used as a}} binder in the granulation process. For batches made with urea, 500  g of wet coal was used with the appropriate addition of urea. The coal only batch used 1500  g of wet coal and additional water. The granulation was carried out in a stainless steel drum granulator with an internal diameter of 37  cm. The drum speed was set at 34  rpm. Granulation of coal with urea occurred very quickly, in less than 10  min; the product granules appeared very wet on the surface. Granulation of coal alone typically took 45 – 60  min. Granules were air dried for at least 72  h at ambient conditions. Product granules with a typical size of 4  mm were used for further pot trials.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{coalescence}} of deformable granules in wet granulation processes is modelled. The model accounts {{for both the}} mechanical properties of the granules {{and the effect of}} the liquid layer at the granule surface. It is an extension to the model of Ennis ct al. (1991) to include the possibility of grannule plastic deformation during collisions. The model is written in dimensionless groups such as viscous and deformation Stokes numbers and the ratio of granule dynamic yield strength to granule Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus (Y-d/E*). These variables are bulk parameters of the powder-binder mixture and also functions of the process intensify. The model glues the conditions for two types of coalescence - type I and type II. Type I coalescence occurs when granules coalesce by viscous dissipation in the surface liquid layer before their surfaces touch. Type II coalescence occurs wizen granules are slowed to a halt during rebound after their surfaces have made contact. The model explains some of the trends observed in the literature, ale pi preliminary validation of the coalescence criterion with <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> data is encouraging. An extension is also made to the case of surface dry granules, where liquid is squeezed to the surface during granule information...|$|R
40|$|Batch {{granulation}} {{experiments on}} a lab-scale drum granulator for a Calcite/Polyvinyl alcohol in water (Calcite/PVOH–H 2 O) system {{are presented in}} this study. Experimental {{studies were carried out}} to study the aggregation kinetics and mechanism for this granulation recipe, whilst investigating the effects of binder-to-solids ratio and drum load on the granule size, binder content and porosity distributions. In particular, the effect of formulation properties and the granulation operating conditions on the batch process dynamics and the end-granule properties are studied. The formulation properties considered include liquid surface tension, powder-liquid contact angle, dynamic yield stress, powder shape and liquid viscosity. The operating variables include the binder-to-solids ratio, binder addition duration and the binder addition mode. The sensitivity in the process and the non-homogeneity of key particle attributes (size, binder content, and porosity) is evident. The important process manipulations for feedback control and potential disturbances are identified, formulating a comprehensive control configuration for batch and continuous granulation, with the latter case being exemplified in Glaser et al. [T., Glaser, C. F. W., Sanders, F. Y., Wang, I. T., Cameron, R., Ramachandran, J. D., Litster, J. M. -H., Poon, C. D., Immanuel, F. J. Doyle, III, 2007.

The importance of multi-scale process models that link fundamental material properties with the granulation mechanisms and end-granule properties is also evident from the experiments.

40|$|Process {{optimisation}} and {{optimal control}} of batch and continuous <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> processes are studied in this paper. The {{main focus of}} the current research has been: (i) construction of optimisation and control relevant, population balance models through the incorporation of moisture content, drum rotation rate and bed depth into the coalescence kernels; (ii) investigation of optimal operational conditions using constrained optimisation techniques; (iii) development of optimal control algorithms based on discretized population balance equations; and (iv) comprehensive simulation studies on optimal control of both batch and continuous granulation processes. The objective of steady state optimisation is to minimise the recycle rate with minimum cost for continuous processes. It has been identified that the drum rotation-rate, bed depth (material charge), and moisture content of solids are practical decision (design) parameters for system optimisation. The objective for the optimal control of batch granulation processes is to maximize the mass of product-sized particles with minimum time and binder consumption. The objective for the optimal control of the continuous process is to drive the process from one steady state to another in a minimum time with minimum binder consumption, which {{is also known as}} the state-driving problem. It has been known for some time that the binder spray-rate is the most effective control (manipulative) variable. Although other possible manipulative variables, such as feed flow-rate and additional powder flow-rate have been investigated in the complete research project, only the single input problem with the binder spray rate as the manipulative variable is addressed in the paper to demonstrate the methodology. It can be shown from simulation results that the proposed models are suitable for control and optimisation studies, and the optimisation algorithms connected with either steady state or dynamic models are successful for the determination of optimal operational conditions and dynamic trajectories with good convergence properties.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{quantify}} the boundaries and validate the granule growth regime map for liquid-bound granules recently proposed by Iveson and Litster (AlChE J. 44 (1998) 1510). This regime map postulates that the type of granule growth behaviour is a function of only two dimensionless groups: the amount of granule deformation during collision (characterised by a Stokes deformation number, St(def)) and the maximum granule pore saturation, s(max). The results of experiments performed with a range of materials (glass ballotini, iron ore fines, copper chalcopyrite powder and a sodium sulphate and cellulose mixture) using both drum and high shear mixer granulators were examined. The <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> results gave good agreement with the proposed regime map. The boundary between crumb and steady growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 1 and the boundary between steady and induction growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 001. The nucleation only boundary occurs at pore saturations that increase from 70 % to 80 % with decreasing St(def). However, the high shear mixer results all had St(def) numbers which were too large. This is most likely to be because the chopper tip-speed is an over-estimate of the average impact velocity granules experience and possibly also due to the dynamic yield strength of the materials being significantly greater than the yield strengths measured at low strain rates. Hence, the map is only a useful tool for comparing the granulation behaviour of different materials in the same device. Until we {{have a better understanding of}} the flow patterns and impact velocities in granulators, it cannot be used to compare different types of equipment. Theoretical considerations also revealed that several of the regime boundaries are also functions of additional parameters not explicitly contained on the map, such as binder viscosity.

40|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>granulation</b> {{processes}} {{are represented by}} a set of mass transfer, solid transport, as well as population balance equations. The population balance is mathematically described by partial differential-integral equations. The overall granulation model is highly non-linear, large-scale with multiple coordinates and uncertain parameters, leading to tremendous difficulties for optimisation and control. In our previous work, a two-level control strategy is proposed, which consists of an upper level optimal control for the determination of optimal set-points, and a lower level non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) for the simultaneous computations of uncertain parameters and control variables. However, long computing times and insufficient measurement data prevent industrial applications. In this paper, strategies are developed to improve the applicability of the multi-level, model predictive control scheme (ML-MPC) using the multi-form modelling approach. In the multi-form modelling approach, the granulation plants are represented by a variety of model forms for different end-uses. These include: (1) the distributed parameter population balance model (DP-PBM), (2) the lumped parameter population balance model (LP-PBM), (3) matrix representation with off-line computed matrix elements, (4) local linear models, (5) reduced order models using balanced truncating and methods of moment. It can be shown through dynamic simulations that significant computing time reductions can be achieved with properly selected model forms. Since both open-loop optimal control and closed loop MPC rely on iterative dynamic optimisation, overall computing time reduction makes on-line applications possible. Furthermore, the development of local linear models allows the applications of well-established linear system theory and techniques to process control, parameter identification and model order reduction. The demonstrated advantages of the proposed multi-form modelling approach imply a big step forward towards the industrial applications of model-based control for granulation processes.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of DEM (Discrete Element Method) {{simulations}} of rotating drums operated {{in a number of}} different flow regimes. DEM simulations of <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> have also been conducted. The aim was to demonstrate that a realistic simulation is possible, and further understanding of the particle motion and granulation processes in a rotating drum. The simulation model has shown good qualitative and quantitative agreement with other published experimental results. A two-dimensional bed of 5000 disc particles, with properties similar to glass has been simulated in the rolling mode (Froude number 0. 0076) with a fractional drum fill of approximately 30 %. Particle velocity fields in the cascading layer, bed cross-section, and at the drum wall have shown good agreement with experimental PEPT data. Particle avalanches in the cascading layer have been shown to be consistent with single layers of particles cascading down the free surface towards the drum wall. Particle slip at the drum wall has been shown to depend on angular position, and ranged from 20 % at the toe and shoulder, to less than 1 % at the mid-point. Three-dimensional DEM simulations of a moderately cascading bed of 50, 000 spherical elastic particles (Froude number 0. 83) with a fractional fill of approximately 30 % have also been performed. The drum axis was inclined by 50 to the horizontal with periodic boundaries at the ends of the drum. The mean period of bed circulation was found to be 0. 28 s.

40|$|A {{population}} balance model is developed {{to describe the}} <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> of feeds with a broad size distribution (e. g. recycled fertiliser granules). Granule growth by coalescence is modelled with a sequential two-stage kernel. The first stage of granulation falls within a non-inertial regime as defined by Ennis et al. (Powder Technol., 65 (1991) 257 - 272), with growth occurring by random coalescence. The size distribution is observed to narrow and quickly reach an equilibrium size distribution. Further growth then occurs within a second inertial stage of granulation in which the granule size distribution broadens and requires a size-dependent kernel. This stage is much slower and granule deformation is important. Non-linear regression is used to fit the model to the experimental data of Adetayo et al. (Chem Eng. Sci., 48 (1993) 3951 - 3961) for granulation of ammonium sulfate, mono-ammonium phosphate and di-ammonium phosphate {{for a range of}} moisture contents, granulation times and initial size distributions. The model accurately describes the shape of the granule size distributions over the full range of data. The extent of granulation occurring within the first stage is given by kt; the extent of growth kt is proportional to the fractional liquid saturation of the granule, S, and increases with binder viscosity. Here, k represents the rate constant for the first stage of growth and t represents the time required to reach the final equilibrium size distribution for the first stage. Changes to the initial size distribution affect kt by changing granule porosity and, therefore, liquid saturation. A critical saturation, S, is necessary for the second stage of granulation to occur, leading to further growth. For S≤S, a final equilibrium size distribution is reached before 5 min of granulation time. For S>S, granules are sufficiently deformable to continue growing for up to 25 min. S decreases with increasing binder viscosity. This model is suitable for use in dynamic simulation of granulation circuits where both moisture content and recycle size distribution may vary significantly with time...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the dry-grind ethanol {{industry}} produced 23 {{million metric}} tons of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Currently DDGS is sold as a feedstock but due to its quality and handling issues, competing with other feed products is challenging. Pellet mills {{have been used in}} the past to enhance DDGS handling and prevent particle segregation during transportation. The current drawback to pelleting DDGS is the high capital and maintenance costs. Instead of using expensive pellet mills, the use of wet granulation has been proposed to enhance DDGS densification and handling while minimizing costs. ^ A lab scale <b>drum</b> <b>granulation</b> process was used to manufacture granules of DDGS by adding condensed distillers solubles (CDS) to wet distillers grains (WDG) under varying formulation and process conditions. A full factorial experimental design was used to test all combinations of factor levels which included CDS binder addition (30, 35, and 40 % (wt/wt)), CDS solids content (22 and 38 %, wet basis), screen size opening (3. 175 and 6. 35 mm), and residence time (1, 2. 5, 5, and 10 min). Measured response variables included mean particle size, bulk density, true density, granule yield (3. 35 - 1. 68 mm), and porosity. Results from the experiment indicated that as binder addition increased between 30, 35, and 40 % mean particle size of the final granules increased to 2. 08, 3. 15, and 4. 45 mm, respectively. As binder solids content increased, the bulk density increased due to the increased amount of dry matter in the final granular product. Porosity decreased as solids content increased mainly due to greater shrinkage of the granules during the drying process. Screen size opening also affected nucleation which influenced the final size and yield of the granules produced. Compression testing of wet granule compacts indicated that increasing CDS binder addition and increasing solids content enhanced granule plasticity. Growth was observed for granules prepared from high binder additions, and low solids content while minimal growth occurred for material prepared from the high solids content CDS. The highest granular yields (~ 80 %) were observed at residence times between 2. 5 and 10 minutes with 35 % binder addition using the high solids content CDS and the small screen size opening. ...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} used for the particle size enlargement of primary powders. The mixing of a liquid with the powder glues the primary particles together, which results {{in the formation of}} the granules. The mixing action can be performed in many ways, like tumbling (<b>drum</b> <b>granulation),</b> fluidizing (fluid bed granulation) and high-intensity mixing (high shear granulation). In the pharmaceutical industry granulation is commonly used for the production of solid formulations (e. g. tablet or capsules). A problem that is regularly observed during high shear granulation is that the drug substance is poorly distributed over the granules. This means that there is a granule size-dependent variation in composition of the granules. In this thesis the granulation mechanisms that are involved in the formation of non-homogeneous granules in a high shear mixer are elucidated. The relevance of the investigation of these mechanisms is emphasised by the current initiative of the authorities concerning quality assurance. This initiative is focused on quality testing throughout the process, which implies that testing at the final stage is inadequate. High shear granulation is commonly used as an intermediate step in the production process of a solid formulation. Consequently, quality control of high shear granulation with respect to granule uniformity is essential. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the mechanisms underlying the inhomogeneity of the granules. This means that the control is often based on trial-and-error experiments instead of science. This thesis provides new scientific insights into these mechanisms, namely; Granule breakage behaviour, which results in a continuous exchange of primary particles, has a positive influence on granule homogeneity. In contrast, absence of granule breakage means that heterogeneous granules can be formed. During layering small primary particles have a higher affinity for growth than large particles. This mechanism, called preferential growth, is responsible for the inhomogeneity. Penetration of binder liquid into the porous powder bed results in the immediate formation of granules already in the early seconds of the granulation process. If these freshly formed granules are strong enough to withstand the shear forces, these granules can function as kernels for preferential growth. Consequently, this nucleation mechanism can induce the granule inhomogeneity. Furthermore, the effects of changes in process and formulation parameters on these mechanisms are determined. In the different chapters mechanistic models are proposed. Firstly, these models are intended to describe these mechanisms. Secondly, the theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the influence of the process condition. The enumerated mechanisms are not only of importance for the granule inhomogeneity phenomena. In fact, these mechanisms will influence the general granulation behaviour in the high shear mixer. Therefore the content of this thesis is discussed in the perspective of current knowledge of high shear granulation. This discussion points out that comprehension of the rate processes of high shear granulation is a general interest. The understanding of the mechanisms provides a fundamental basis to prevent costly trial-and-error experiments to assure control of the high shear granulation process. For the pharmaceutical industry this control is mainly focused on homogeneity, while other granule properties will be of importance in a different industrial environment...|$|R
