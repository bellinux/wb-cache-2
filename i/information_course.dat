40|$|We utilize {{a unique}} pair of {{experiments}} {{to isolate the}} various ways in which reductions in asymmetric information alter credit market outcomes. First, a Guatemalan microfinance lender began {{the use of a}} credit bureau without the knowledge of borrowers. One year later, we ran a large randomized credit <b>information</b> <b>course</b> which described the existence and workings of the bureau to the clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand side of the market. Our results indicate that credit bureaus generate large efficiency gains for the lender, that these gains are augmented when borrowers understand the rules of the game, and that economic mobility both upwards and downwards is likely to increase...|$|E

A syllabus quiz may be especially valuable in introductory level courses, enhancing students ’ accli-mation to the expectations of the instructor, the department, and the institution.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Team-based {{learning}} (TBL) employs {{active learning}} strategies and encourages students {{to ask questions}} among their peers. PURPOSE: TBL takes an approach that engages every student within each team and alleviates the chance one team member may carry the whole team. Because this technique reinforces the subject matter by having each student take an individual test and then a team test, the increased scores emphasized TBL over standard lecturing. METHODOLOGY: TBL was used in a Drug <b>Information</b> <b>course</b> that focused on learning tertiary databases. Two years of grades using TBL were compared with the two previous years when standard lectures were used. RESULTS: For the two years before incorporating TBL, the average was 81 %, whereas the subsequent average was 90 %. CONCLUSIONS: Students particularly liked to physically look up answers using the databases provided, which resembled real life experience...|$|E
