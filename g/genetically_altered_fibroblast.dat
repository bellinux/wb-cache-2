40|$|Summary — The {{impetus to}} develop useful models of human disease and {{toxicity}} {{has resulted in}} a number of large-scale mouse mutagenesis programmes. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable concern regarding the scientific validity and welfare of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> mice, and the large numbers of mice that are required by such programmes. In this paper, the scientific advantages and limitations of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> mice as models of several human diseases are discussed. We conclude that, while the use of some such mouse models has contributed considerably to an understanding of human disease and toxicity, other <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> mouse models have limited scientific relevance, and fewer have positively contributed to the development of novel human medicines. Suggestions for improving this unsatisfactory situation are made...|$|R

40|$|An {{in vitro}} study was {{performed}} to define in greater detail those factors which favored {{the growth of the}} ts- 1 mutant of respiratory syncytial virus under restrictive conditions and the emergence of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> virus with decreased temperature sensitivity. Replication of ts- 1 occurred at each of the restrictive temperatures of 37, 38, and 39 C, even through plaque formation was not observed. The level of virus growth under restrictive conditions was inversely related to the incubation temperature and directly related to the multiplicity of infection. These relationships appeared to reflect the effect of restrictive temperature in reducing the quantity of virus produced and released from an infected cell. Under restrictive conditions the production of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> virus which exhibited reduced temperature sensitivity was directly related to the multiplicity of infection and inversely related to temperature. Production of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> virus was not observed under permissive conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of second primary tumors {{has a negative}} impact on the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Previously, we detected <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> and tumor-related mucosal lesions in the resection margins in 25 % of unselected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (Tabor MP, Brakenhoff RH, van Houten VMM, Kummer JA, Snel MHJ, Snijders PJF, Snow GB, Leemans CR, Braakhuis BJM: Persistence of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> fields in head and neck cancer patients: biological and clinical implications. Clin Cancer Res 2001, 7 : 1523 – 1532). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether first and second primary tumors are clonally related and originate from a single <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> field. From 10 patients we analyzed the first tumor of the oral cavity or oropharynx, the > 3 -cm remote second primary tumor, and the mucosa from the tumor-free margins from both resection specimens. We compared TP 53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity profiles using 19 microsatellite markers at chromosomes 3 p, 9 p, 13 q, and 17 p. In all patients, <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> mucosal lesions were detected in at least one resection margin from both first and second primary tumor. Evidence for a common clonal origin of the first tumor, second primary tumor, and the intervening mucosa was found for at least 6 of 10 patients. Our results indicate that a proportion of multiple primary tumors have developed within a single preneoplastic field. Based on different etiology and clinical consequences, we propose that independent second primary tumors should be distinguished from second field tumors, that arise from the same <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> field the first tumor has developed from...|$|R

40|$|<b>Genetically</b> <b>altered</b> {{microbes}} {{are used}} widely {{in the conduct}} of scientific study and have facilitated the development of new medical therapies, preventive strategies, and diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, such organisms may also cause infectious disease outbreaks as a result of accidental or intentional transmission to humans. The unique microbial properties of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> pathogens and the clinical symptoms exhibited by persons infected with them may impede the usual diagnostic and clinical evaluations or preventive strategies. Practicing physicians and clinicians at microbiology laboratories, who {{would be the first to}} observe such infections, must consider the broad clinical possibilities of illnesses caused by deliberately altered microorganisms and the potential difficulty in confirming a diagnosis.
