It can also involve oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract {{with a lower}} frequency. The involvement of internal organs and lymph nodes is rare, and its primary compromise is even more uncommon. We report an unusual presentation of classic KS in the lymph nodes of three patients. A 46 years old male had a primary involvement of an inguinal lymph node. Dermal involvement appeared one year later. A 58 years old male and a 76 years old female with simultaneous dermal and lymph node involvement.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} observational studies {{performed at}} the main reference centre for paediatric HIV care and management in Mozambique, {{which is one of}} the countries most strongly affected by the AIDS pandemic. These studies focused on horizontal transmission, treatment outcomes and paediatric antiretroviral drug resistance in a cohort of HIV- 1 -infected children. The majority of children infected by HIV get the infection from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery or through breastfeeding, in what is known as mother-to-child transmission of HIV- 1. However, some of them, in a percentage that is not well ascertained in resource-constrained settings, can be infected through other modes. In the first paper, we explored different risk factors that might have contributed to HIV infection in a small cohort of HIV-infected children born to HIV non-infected mothers. A case control study strongly suggested health care as the possible source of infection for many of these children, with blood transfusion being significantly associated with HIV infection. Paediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been available for children in Mozambique since December 2003. During the period between December 2003 and December 2008, more than 4700 children aged 0 - 18 years were recruited, and 1125 received ART in our centre. Survival frequency was 87 % after 60 months of antiretroviral treatment. The median follow-up time after ART initiation in the cohort was 24. 4 months (IQR 13. 5 - 35. 7). After 5 years of ART, 710 children (98. 1 %) were on first-line treatment, and 21 children (1. 9 %) were on second-line treatment. After 12 months on ART, there was an improvement in mean (SD) CD 4 % from 12. 3 (6. 3) to 27. 7 (8. 8) (p 24 months), with a per month increase of 1. 09 [1. 02 - 1. 16] (p= 0. 0065). Opportunistic infections are frequent in HIV- 1 -infected children, as are oncology-related infections. To date, there are no published reports investigating clinical outcomes of HIV- 1 -infected children with <b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> We described chemotherapy and ART outcomes in a cohort of 28 children with histological confirmed AIDS-associated <b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (AKS). The cohort included twenty (71 %) males and 8 females who were moderately ill, severely immunosuppressed children. The mean patient age was 8. 3 (range 2 - 16) years, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 27. 3 (14. 9) months. All patients were ART naive. Twenty-four children on ART were alive at 6 months after completing chemotherapy, corresponding to a survival rate of 85. 7 %. The CD 4 % increased from a mean (SD) of 16 % (9. 2) to 29. 2 % (27. 1) before initiation and after cessation of chemotherapy (p= 0. 02).

40|$|Mucosal {{melanoma}} of {{the head}} and neck is a relatively rare condition that has been poorly understood, characterized and studied. A 28 -year-old male patient reported a swelling in relation to the right upper incisor teeth. The lesion was mobile, with slight bleeding on probing. Differential diagnosis of gingival hyperplasia/fibrosis, giant cell epulis, <b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> and malignant melanoma were kept. Histopathological sections showed sheets of pleomorphic spindle cells with intracytoplasmic brown-black pigment, involving the lower part of the squamous epithelium- Tumor cells were positive for S- 100 and HMB- 45 (Human Melanoma Black) immunostain and a diagnosis of malignant melanoma was rendered. The patient underwent partial maxillectomy and the case was categorized as stage If. He also received regional radiotherapy: however after five months, the patient presented with a metastasis to the lymph nodes that was confirmed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The patient underwent radical neck dissection that showed a large tumor mass. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, the mucosal melanomas have an aggressive vertical growth phase. Different cell types, like spindled, plasmacytoid, and epithelioid may be observed. The treatment of choice is complete excision with adequate negative margins. The role of radiotherapy is not clearly defined since malignant melanoma is relatively insensitive to radiation. The prognosis for mucosal melanoma is generally quite poor because of its tendency to invade and cause early hematogenous metastasis. Nodal involvement reduces survival time and multiple local recurrences are the most common cause of treatment failure...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Pneumonia {{is still}} {{a major problem in}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -infected patients, and despite extensive investigation the aetiology remains unknown in many cases. The prevalence of the eight human herpesviruses was determined by polymerase chain reaction in 91 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 72 HIV-infected patients with 91 episodes of suspected pneumonia. The presence of herpesviruses was related to clinical and immunological findings and the prevalence of herpesviruses in HIV-infected patients was compared with the prevalence in BAL fluid from 50 healthy, immunocompetent individuals. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus- 8 (HHV 8) were found in 5. 5 %, 36 %, and 5. 5 % of BAL fluid samples from HIV-infected patients. No herpesviruses were detectable in BAL fluid from healthy, immunocompetent individuals. The herpesviruses occurred mainly in patients with CD 4 z counts v 2006106 L- 1. All patients with herpesviruses recovered without specific antiviral treatment. Two patients with HHV 8 had the diagnosis of <b>Kaposi</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> It is concluded that cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus- 8 are frequently present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from severely immunocompro-mised human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms.

40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is the etiological {{agent of}} {{three types of}} malignancies: <b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS), multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Infection by KSHV displays two different phases: latent and lytic replication phase. By using an unbiased gain-of-function human kinome cDNA screen, the work in this thesis identified two kinases, Pim- 1 and - 3, {{to be involved in}} KSHV reactivation. Ectopic expression of Pim- 1 and Pim- 3 induced viral lytic replication leading to production of progeny viruses, whereas depletion of Pim- 1 and Pim- 3 by RNA interference inhibited the induction of lytic reactivation. Pim- 1 and - 3 was shown to regulate viral reactivation by phosphorylation of LANA, which abolished the LANA-mediated repression of lytic transcription. In this thesis project we developed a novel three-dimensional (3 D) cell model to identify novel oncogenic processes involved in the KSHV-induced endothelial cells (EC) transformation. The results demonstrate that KSHV induces transcriptional reprogramming of primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to mesenchymal cells via endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a process implicated in promoting tumor growth and cell invasiveness. Two viral gene products, vFLIP and vGPCR, were found to trigger Notch signaling and lead to the KSHV-induced EndMT. Our data further identifies a membrane associated matrix metalloproteinase MT 1 -MMP as a previously unrecognized regulator downstream of Notch to induce EndMT. 3 D KSHV-infected LECs (K-LECs) transcriptome showed significant up-regulation of invasion related genes that were found co-regulated in 3 D K-LECs and KS biopsies. The results further demonstrate that 3 D culture provides a permissive microenvironment for continuous viral replication and persistence. To summarize, this PhD thesis greatly expands the understanding of host signaling pathways involved in KSHV reactivation and oncogenesis. Furthermore, this thesis provides novel information about cellular targets for pharmacological control in KS and other virus-associated cancers. Ei saatavill...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is tightly {{regulated}} {{in order}} to provide adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for normal cellular function. Tissue oxygenation represents a balance between the requirement for oxygen to maintain the cellular energy level and the potential risk of cellular oxidative damage. The master regulator of oxygen homeostasis is Hypoxia inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1). Our basic hypothesis was therefore that HIF modulation might be relevant for diseases characterised by dysregulated angiogenesis, such as diabetes mellitus and tumors. Chronic complications of diabetes are a major health problem, and a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms could offer a more rational therapy. Both hyperglycemia and hypoxia play important roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and we propose that the interplay between these two factors is essential in determining the devellopement of chronic complications of diabetes. We demonstrated that high concentrations of glucose interfere with hypoxia-dependent stabilization of HIF- 1 alpha against proteasomal degradation in both primary human dermal fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells. The destabilizing effect of glucose was partially independent of prolyl hydroxylases (PHD). Hyperglycemia also inhibited transactivation and function of HIF- 1 as demonstrated by a HRE (hypoxia responsive elements) reporter gene assay. In agreement with our in vitro observations we detect lower expression of HIF- 1 alpha in diabetic wounds then in venous ulcers that share the same hypoxic environment but not the chronic exposure to hyperglycemia. Based on these findings we further investigated the potential therapeutic effect of HIF- 1 alpha up-regulation in diabetic woundsby using DMOG, a chemical inducer of HIF- 1 alpha which showed virtually no toxic effect on primary dermal fibroblasts in vitro. Local treatment with DMOG normalized the healing rate of experimental wounds in db/db mice suggesting that HIF- 1 alpha modulation is a promising therapeutical approach for diabetic wounds. Dysregulated angiogenesis is also a hallmark of tumor diseases. <b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS) is a highly vascularised tumor, which depends strictly on angiogenetic stimuli. We have therefore investigated the HIF pathway in KS and its relation to the insulin like growth factor (IGF) system, known as a major factor in pathophysiology of different tumors. We demonstrated that KS cells express both HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha even in normoxia and that IGF-I induced their expression, showing {{for the first time that}} a growth factor is able to induce accumulation of both HIFalpha congeners. HIF accumulation was followed by functional activation as demonstrated by a HRE reporter gene assay and by induction of HIF target genes (ex. VEGF). IGF-I induced accumulation of both HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha at a posttranscriptional level as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and cycloheximide chasing experiment and we suggest that IGF-I increased the translation of the alpha subunits. The clinical relevance of our findings was confirmed by the identification of high levels of both HIF isofoms in tumor cells in biopsies from patients with AIDS-related KS. It was further demonstrated that IGF-I and IGF-II are potent growth factors for KS cells and have an additive effect with VEGF. IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) was identified as the receptor mediating the IGFs effect and we described an autocrine loop in KS cells in which IGF-II is the endogenous ligand for IGF-IR. Finally, it was demonstrated that blocking the IGF-IR with picropodophyllin, a recently described selective IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor, induced apoptosis and decreased HIF accumulation and function in KS cells, suggesting a potential future therapeutic approach. In conclusion, HIF is an important factor both in chronic complications of diabetes and in vascular tumor KS. We have highlighted that glucose and IGF-I regulate HIF by other mechanisms than the classic hypoxic regulation. Finally it was demonstrated that modulation of HIF can be a successful approach for treatment of both diabetic wounds and KS...|$|E
40|$|<b>Kaposi</b> <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS) studies Kaposi´s sarcoma (KS) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} AIDS tumor (AKS) and associated with HHV- 8, but controversial whether a clonal tumor or mostly a reactive proliferation of endothelial spindle cells (SC). In the present studies AKS and endemic KS (EKS) biopsies were compared for expression of HHV- 8 -LANA, the lymphatic endothelial (LEC) markers LYVE- 1 and Ki- 67 (proliferation). The study material is archival, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical KS biopsies and sera from the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania) at early and late tumor stages of African AKS and EKS cases with cutaneous and oral (OKS) lesions from male, female, adult and juvenile KS patients. KS histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (papers I-III) by single, double and/or triple antibody immunofluorescence (IFA) showed that: a) LANA+/CD 34 - cells were more frequent in early as compared to late KS {{and most of them}} expressed LEC markers LYVE- 1, D 2 - 40 and VEGFR- 3, suggesting that the resident LECs represent an early target of primary HHV- 8 infection; b) LANA+/CD 34 -/LYVE- 1 + cells decreased from early (25 %) to late (4 %) KS while LANA+/CD 34 + SC increased suggesting a phenotype switch from LEC to VEC, c) LANA appeared better correlated to LYVE- 1 (LEC) than to CD 34 (VEC) expression suggesting heterogeneous SC permissiveness to HHV- 8 (paper I), d) the number of HHV- 8 infected (LANA+) SC (CD 34 +) cells as well as LANA+ granules per SC nucleus was significantly higher in male vs. female, juvenile vs. adult and oral AKS [OAKS] vs. cutaneous KS lesions; e) similarly, tumor cell proliferation (Ki- 67 immunoreactivity) in adult OAKS was significantly higher for male vs. female, juvenile vs. adult and OAKS vs. cutaneous KS lesions respectively; f) a positive correlation was apparently found between LANA+ SC and Ki- 67 immunoreactivity (paper II). Together these findings suggest that tumor proliferation correlates with increasing HHV- 8 LANA expression supporting the notion of viral (LANA) -driven cell proliferation during KS oncogenesis (paper II); g) a significantly higher viral load was also seen by quantitative RT-PCR in late nodular OAKS compared with cutaneous AKS lesions corroborating IHC results and indicating that the oral cavity is important for entry and/or reservoir for HHV- 8 infection (papers II & III); h) the frequency of LANA+ SC in the tumor increases during the evolution of both cutaneous and oral KS lesions, suggesting a correlation between tumor growth and viral replication in the lesions, however, by RT-PCR, we observed that serum viral loads appeared to decrease in the corresponding patients whereas (paper III) all sera from early stage (patch-plaque) KS were positive for anti-HHV- 8 antibodies while all HHV- 8 negative sera were from late-stage nodular KS patients (paper IV). This supports our novel notion of a stage-dependent tissue-serum discrepancy in viral loads and HHV- 8 antigen expression probably due to virus tissue retention, immune-segregation and/or selective clearance. Thus serum HHV- 8 viral loads may not be sufficient for clinical and therapeutic prognostication (papers III & IV); i) the frequency of HHV- 8 infection was high among the studied MNH cases and as expected, HHV- 8 and HIV infection was more associated with KS compared to non-KS tumors and non-neoplastic conditions; j) the findings by IFA and ELISA had a high HHV- 8 diagnostic concordance although ELISA seemed to have higher positive predictive value (PPV), specificity as well as a high sensitivity allowing more affordable HHV- 8 screening in a resource-constrained country like Tanzania (paper IV). These findings also indicate the importance of routine HHV- 8 screening among blood/organ donors to prevent transmission as well as in prospective transplant recipients to predict and possibly prevent iatrogenic KS (IKS) development (paper IV). Malignant lymphoma (ML) studies ML are second to KS as AIDS-related malignancies and have been reported to increase steadily with the HIV pandemic particularly in sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania. The WHO classification, HIV and EBV association as well as ploidy and heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in Tanzania is not well documented. Our current study (paper V) has established that the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms can apparently be applied for the diagnosis of Tanzanian ML. Extranodal presentation of ML was frequent particularly for T-cell lymphomas (TCL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) phenotype heterogeneity and frequency at MNH (Tanzania) was similar to that observed in Western countries suggesting applicability of similar, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches (paper V). The attended ML at MNH had frequent aneuploidy, EBV infection as well as high DNA indices and cell proliferation (Ki- 67). HIV infection was apparently associated with increased ML cell proliferation (paper V) ...|$|E
40|$|Vasculogenesis is {{the process}} by which Endothelial Precursor Cells (EPCs) form a vasculature. This process has been {{traditionally}} regarded as an embryological process of vessel formation. However, as early as in the 602 ̆ 7 s the concept of postnatal vasculogenesis was introduced, with a strong resurface of this idea in recent years. Similarly, previous work on a mouse skin tumor model provided us with the grounds to consider the role of vasculogenesis during tumor formation. ^ We examined the contribution of donor bone marrow (BM) -derived cells to neovascularization in recipient nude mice with Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor that most often affects children and young adults between 5 and 30 years of age. Despite multiple attempts to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for the disease, the 2 -year metastases-free survival rate for patients with Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> has not improved over the past 15 years. New therapeutic approaches are therefore needed to reduce the mortality rate. ^ The contribution of BM endothelial precursor cells in the development of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> was examined using different strategies to track the donor-derived cells. Using a BMT model that takes advantage of MHC differences between donor and recipient mice, we have found that donor BM cells were involved in the formation of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> vasculature. ^ Cells responsible for this vasculogenesis activity may be located within the stem cell population of the murine BM. These stem cells would not only generate the hematopoietic lineage but they would also generate ECs. Bone marrow SP (Side Population) cells pertain to a subpopulation that can be identified using flow cytometric analysis of Hoechst 33342 -stained BM. This population of cells has HSC activity. We have tested the ability of BM SP cells to contribute to vasculogenesis in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> using our MHC mismatched transplant model. Mice transplanted with SP cells developed tumor neovessels that were derived from the donor SP cells. Thus, SP cells not only replenished the hematopoietic system of the lethally irradiated mice, but also differentiated into a non-hematopoietic cell lineage and contributed to the formation of the tumor vasculature. ^ In summary, we have demonstrated that BM-derived cells are involved in the generation of the new vasculature during the growth of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> The finding that vasculogenesis plays a role in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> development opens the possibility of using genetically modified BM-derived cells for the treatment of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Ecteinascidin 743 (Et- 743), {{which is}} a novel DNA minor groove alkylator with a unique {{spectrum}} of antitumor activity, is currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trials. Although the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed antitumor activity are poorly understood, recent data suggests that post-translational modifications of RNA polymerase II Large Subunit (RNAPII LS) may {{play a central role}} in the cellular response to this promising anticancer agent. The stalling of an actively transcribing RNAPII LS at Et- 743 -DNA adducts is the initial cellular signal for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). In this manner, Et- 743 poisons TC-NER and produces DNA single strand breaks. Et- 743 also inhibits the transcription and RNAPII LS-mediated expression of selected genes. Because the poisoning of TC-NER and transcription inhibition are critical components of the molecular response to Et- 743 treatment, we have investigated if changes in RNAPII LS contribute to the disruption of these two cellular pathways. In addition, we have studied changes in RNAPII LS in two tumors for which clinical responses were reported in phase I/II clinical trials: renal cell carcinoma and Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Our results demonstrate that Et- 743 induces degradation of the RNAPII LS that is dependent on active transcription, a functional 26 S proteasome, and requires functional TC-NER, but not global genome repair. Additionally, we have provided the first experimental data indicating that degradation of RNAPII LS might lead to the inhibition of activated gene transcription. A set of studies performed in isogenic renal carcinoma cells deficient in von Hippel-Lindau protein, {{which is a}} ubiquitin-E 3 -ligase for RNAPII LS, confirmed the central role of RNAPII LS degradation in the sensitivity to Et- 743. Finally, we have shown that RNAPII LS is also degraded in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> tumors following Et- 743 treatment and provide data to suggest that this event plays a role in decreased expression of the Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> oncoprotein, EWS-Fli 1. Altogether, these data implicate degradation of RNAPII LS as a critical event following Et- 743 exposure and suggest that the clinical activity observed in renal carcinoma and Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> may be mediated by disruption of molecular pathways requiring a fully functional RNAPII LS. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} if insulin treatment {{can enhance the}} antitumor eff ect of 5 -fl uorouracil (5 -FU), and to explore the mech-anism of the enhancement of insulin. METHODS <b>S</b> 180 <b>sarcoma,</b> H 22 liver cancer and human Eca- 109 esophageal cancer cells were transplanted into nude mice to evaluate the inhibitory eff ect on tumor growth of insulin alone or in combination with 5 -FU. The levels of serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) were determined.

40|$|THREE {{different}} forms of mouse leukaemia resulting from cell-free preparations of <b>S</b> 37 <b>sarcoma</b> have been described. Myeloid leukaemia with {{a large proportion of}} chloroleukaemia was isolated from this source among others by Graffi (1957). Franks et al. (1957, 1959) reported a chronic leukosis associated with overgrowth of large anaplastic mononuclear cells appearing in spleen, liver, kidneys and lymph glands. More recently Moloney (1960) described a lymphoid leukaemia which he also isolated from <b>S</b> 37 <b>sarcoma</b> tissue by filtration and differential centrifugation. The disease described by Franks and his associates arose originally in a Swiss mouse which had undergone <b>S</b> 37 <b>sarcoma</b> regression following X-ray treatment. Later it was found that cell-free extracts of diseased spleen or of S 37 tumour tissue itself gave rise to the same condition.

At the largest center for histopathology in Pakistan, we looked at three common bone sarcomas in our practice i. e. osteosarcoma, Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> and chondrosarcoma. Our aim was to compile {{epidemiological data}} regarding age, gender and site distribution, and to correlate our findings with published western data {{in order to determine}} whether there were any significant differences in our population compared to the west. An overwhelming majority of osteosarcomas in our study occurred {{in the second and third}} decades of life, they were common in males, and femur, tibia and hip bone were the commonest bones involved accounting for an overwhelming majority of cases. The large majority of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sarcomas</b> in our study occurred in the first three decades of life, they were more common in males, vertebrae, tibia, femur and hip bone were the commonest sites. In our study, chondrosarcomas showed a wide range of age distribution and occurred quite commonly in the young.

40|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1981 in young homosexual men. Since then, it has spread at an explosive pace across the globe. AIDS is an infectious disease due to HIV. The oral manifestations are mainly {{a result of}} cellular immunodeficiency induced by HIV infection. Some of these have been acknowledged as being of great importance in early diagnosis of the disease. Oral lesions strongly associsted with HIV infection are oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, intraoral Kaposi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> non-Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV-associated periodontal disease. Oral candidiasis occurrs as pseudomembranous and erythematous type. Oral hairy leukoplakia has a white irregular corrugated surface of the lateral border of the tongue.

Because of the vascular proliferative characteristics noted in both Kaposi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS) and BA and occasional colocalization of KS and BA, the possibility was explored that KS-associated herpes virus (KSHV) might be associated with BA lesions.

Only 1 of 10 BA tissues, a splenic biopsy, was positive in this assay; this tissue was from a patient with concomitant KS of the skin.
