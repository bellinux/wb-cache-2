40|$|The {{interface}} between tourism and built heritage is complicated because much built heritage {{is located in}} the middle of living communities. Questions arise about how to achieve a balance between the expectations of tourists and the community. To study this question, this paper reports on tourists’ and residents’ impressions of an international heritage tourism site, the Kampong Taman Sari in Indonesia. Using a linear-numeric semantic differential as the measuring instrument and nine consensus photographs of the site as stimuli, the study investigated similarities and differences in impressions between three groups: tourists (international and <b>domestic)</b> and <b>residents.</b> Three principal dimensions were found to underlie impressions of the site: Attractiveness, Organisation, and Novelty. Significant differences were found among all three groups in their impressions of Attractiveness. In terms of impressions of the Organisation of the site, international and domestic tourists have similar impressions but these differ significantly from the impressions of residents. On the other hand, <b>domestic</b> tourists and <b>residents</b> have similar impressions of the Novelty of the site, which is evaluated differently by international tourists...|$|R

40|$|We {{model the}} effects of consumption-type taxes which differ {{according}} to the base and location of the tax. Our model incorporates a monopolist producing and selling in two countries with three sources of rent, each in a different location: a fixed factor (located with production), mobile managerial skill, and a monopoly mark-up (located with consumption). In the general case, we show that for national governments, there are tradeoffs in choosing between alternative taxes. In particular, a cash-flow tax on a source basis creates welfare-impairing distortions to production and consumption, but is incident on the owners of domestic production who may be non-resident. By contrast, a destination-based cash-flow tax does not distort behavior, but is incident only on <b>domestic</b> <b>residents.</b> In the alternative case of perfect competition, with the returns to the fixed factor accruing to <b>domestic</b> <b>residents,</b> the only distortion from the source-based tax is through the allocation of the mobile managerial skill. In this case, the sourcebased tax is also incident only on <b>domestic</b> <b>residents,</b> and is dominated by an equivalent tax on a destination basis, or by a sales tax. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model to explain two stylised facts about immigration.

In fact such migrants are of the same order of magnitude as their domestic workforce. Secondly, migrants are often segregated in jobs. The <b>domestic</b> <b>residents</b> do not wish to be employed in these jobs due to their unattractive working conditions and payments. The model assumes that <b>domestic</b> <b>residents</b> are all identical in terms of their skills and wealth and furthermore that native and foreign workers have the same skills. However, foreign migrants cannot be excluded from the use of public services, the quality of which decreases due to congestion created or enhanced by migrants.
