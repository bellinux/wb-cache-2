60|$|Then all the sea devils--those {{above and}} the one behind, and the two on the sides--laughed all together, and their {{laughter}} was so horrible that it made <b>even</b> <b>Trot</b> shudder.|$|E
60|$|No {{sign of a}} trail showed {{where the}} base of the slope rolled out to meet the green plain. The earth was gravelly, with dark patches of heavy silt, almost like cinders; and round, black rocks, flinty and glassy, cracked away from the hoofs of the mustangs. There was a level bench a mile wide, then a ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded ridge and ravine, one after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous sea. Indian paint-brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus. There was no sage. Soapweed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren; and it was green only at a distance. Nas Ta Bega kept on a steady, <b>even</b> <b>trot.</b> The sun climbed. The wind rose and whipped dust from under the mustangs.|$|E
60|$|Hare {{watched the}} glimmering {{lights of the}} village vanish one by one, like Jack-o'-lanterns. The horses kept a steady, <b>even</b> <b>trot</b> on into the huge windy hall of the desert night. Fleecy clouds veiled the stars, yet {{transmitted}} a wan glow. A chill crept over Hare. As he crawled under the blankets Naab had spread for him his hand {{came into contact with}} a polished metal surface cold as ice. It was his rifle. Naab had placed it under the blankets. Fingering the rifle Hare found the spring opening {{on the right side of}} the breech, and, pressing it down, he felt the round head of a cartridge. Naab had loaded the weapon, he had placed it where Hare's hand must find it, yet he had not spoken of it. Hare did not stop to reason with his first impulse. Without a word, with silent insistence, disregarding his shattered health, August Naab had given him a man's part to play. The full meaning lifted Hare out of his self-abasement; once more he felt himself a man.|$|E
60|$|That <b>evening</b> <b>Trot</b> gave a grand ball in her palace, {{to which}} the most {{important}} of the Pinkies and the Blueskins were invited. The combined bands of both the countries played the music, and a fine supper was served. The Pinkies would not dance with the Blues, however, nor would the Blues dance with the Pinkies. The two nations were so different in all ways that they were unable to agree at all, and several times during the evening quarrels arose and there was fighting between them, which Trot promptly checked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, you are." [...] That {{was all the}} much-tried Marilla said, but {{something}} in her tone squelched <b>even</b> Davy. He <b>trotted</b> obediently upstairs with Anne.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. My property!' {{returned}} my aunt. 'Agnes, my dear, {{as long as}} I {{believed it}} had been really made away with by your father, I wouldn't--and, my dear, I didn't, <b>even</b> to <b>Trot,</b> as he knows--breathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment. But, now I know this fellow's answerable for it, and I'll have it! Trot, come and {{take it away from}} him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{reached the}} boat safely and while Trot was untying the rope Cap'n Bill reached into a crevice {{of the rock}} and drew out several tallow candles {{and a box of}} wax matches, which he thrust into the capacious pockets of his [...] "sou'wester." [...] This sou'wester was a short coat of oilskin which the old sailor wore on all occasions--when he wore a coat at all--and the pockets always {{contained}} a variety of objects, useful and ornamental, which made <b>even</b> <b>Trot</b> wonder where they all came from and why Cap'n Bill should treasure them. The jackknives--a big one and a little one--the bits of cord, the fishhooks, the nails: these were handy to have on certain occasions. But bits of shell, and tin boxes with unknown contents, buttons, pincers, bottles of curious stones and the like, seemed quite unnecessary to carry around. That was Cap'n Bill's business, however, and now that he added the candles and the matches to his collection Trot made no comment, for she knew these last were to light their way through the caves. The sailor always rowed the boat, for he handled the oars with strength and skill. Trot sat in the stern and steered. The place where they embarked was a little bight or circular bay, and the boat cut across a much larger bay toward a distant headland where the caves were located, right at the water's edge. They were nearly a mile from shore and about halfway across the bay when Trot suddenly sat up straight and exclaimed: [...] "What's that, Cap'n?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{they did}} get acquainted, {{in a very}} short time, and before the <b>evening</b> was over <b>Trot</b> felt that she knew every person and animal present at the reception, and that they were all her good friends.|$|R
60|$|Dale {{was quick}} in the saddle, {{followed}} by John, but the horses {{had to be}} severely punished to force them <b>even</b> to a <b>trot.</b> And that was a lagging trot, which now did not leave Torn behind.|$|R
6000|$|The new Boolooroo seemed rather {{sorry to}} lose his friends, but the people were {{secretly}} glad {{to get rid of}} the strangers, especially of the Pinkies. They maintained a sullen silence while Coralie and Captain Tintint formed their ranks in marching order, and they did not <b>even</b> cheer when <b>Trot</b> said to them in a final speech: ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{six o'clock}} in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman getting better, and also getting himself into his {{obsolete}} little silk stockings and pumps, for the wondering dinner at the Veneerings. And seven {{o'clock in the}} <b>evening</b> finds him <b>trotting</b> out into Duke Street, to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s, {{one of his}} sons, Dexter, trotted {{the mile}} in 2:17Â¼;a record. Dexter was {{immediately}} bought for $25,000 by a Robert E. Bonner for his own private driving pleasure. A rigidly moral man, Bonner did not approve of racing or betting, so {{no one will ever}} know if Dexter could have <b>trotted</b> <b>even</b> faster. But ever since, no horse lacking lines to Hambletonian 10 in their pedigree has ever done better.|$|R
60|$|I had come, perhaps, {{the better}} {{half of the}} {{distance}} I had to travel, and I was giving full rein to my joyous fancy, when suddenly I espied ahead a company of horsemen. They were approaching me at a brisk pace, but I took no thought of them, accounting myself secure from any molestation. If it so happened {{that it was a}} search party from Pesaro, seeking two men disguised as monks who had ravished the coffin of Madonna Paola di Santafior, what should they want of Lazzaro Biancomonte? And so, in my confidence, I advanced <b>even</b> as they <b>trotted</b> quickly towards me.|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Finkel, {{writing in}} The Guardian, {{describes}} it as, [...] "a new Turkish primer... which cuts a brisk and lucid {{way through the}} great themes of Turkish life today", in [...] "a brave attempt to chart the challenges facing the EUs new applicant." [...] Maureen Freely, writing in New Statesman, adds that [...] "This {{is a lot to}} cover in 258 pages", and [...] "The book moves at a pretty fast clip.... Yet, <b>even</b> as we <b>trot</b> along, struggling to keep up, we get a pretty clear idea of how the Turkish state developed, and where the people stand in relation to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Turn {{your chair}} around towards me," [...] she invited. [...] "This is the hour I like best of any during the day. Do {{you see what}} a {{beautiful}} view I have of the Houses of Parliament? And there across the river, behind that mist, the cesspool begins. Sometimes I lie here and think. I see right into Bermondsey and Rotherhithe and all those places and think out {{the lives of the}} people as they are being lived. Then I look through those wonderful windows there--how they glitter in the sunshine, don't they!--and I think I hear the men speak whom they have sent to plead their cause. Some Demosthenes from Tower Hill exhausts himself with phrase-making, shouts himself into a perspiration, drawing lurid, pictures of hideous and apparent wrongs, and a hundred or so well-dressed legislators whisper behind the palms of their hands, make their plans for the <b>evening</b> and <b>trot</b> into their appointed lobbies like sheep when the division bell rings. It is the most tragical epitome of inadequacy the world has ever known." ...|$|R
60|$|They heard a low rumble and {{a shrill}} {{squeaking}} sound, {{and going out}} {{to the front of the}} house, they saw coming around the corner a car drawn by a gorgeous jeweled dragon, which moved its head to right and left and flashed its eyes like headlights of an automobile and uttered a growling noise as it slowly moved toward them. When it stopped before the High Coco-Lorum's house, Toto barked sharply at the sprawling beast, but <b>even</b> tiny <b>Trot</b> could see that the dragon was not alive. Its scales were of gold, and each one was set with sparkling jewels, while it walked in such a stiff, regular manner that it could be nothing else than a machine. The chariot that trailed behind it was likewise of gold and jewels, and when they entered it, they found there were no seats. Everyone was supposed to stand up while riding. The charioteer was a little, diamond-headed fellow who straddled the neck of the dragon and moved the levers that made it go.|$|R
60|$|It was, therefore, perhaps, {{with some}} {{mitigation}} of his usual critical severity {{that he saw}} her walking before him alone in the lane as he rode home to quarters. She was apparently lost in a half-impatient, half-moody reverie, which <b>even</b> the <b>trotting</b> hoof-beats {{of his own and}} his orderly's horse had not disturbed. From time to time she struck the myrtle hedge beside her with the head of a large flower which hung by its stalk from her listless hands, or held it to her face as if to inhale its perfume. Dismissing his orderly by a side path, he rode gently forward, but, to his surprise, without turning, or seeming to be aware of his presence, she quickened her pace, and even appeared to look from side to side for some avenue of escape. If only to mend matters, he was obliged to ride quickly forward to her side, where he threw himself from his horse, flung the reins on his arm, and began to walk beside her. She at first turned a slightly flushed cheek away from him, and then looked up with a purely simulated start of surprise.|$|R
5000|$|In open or all-breed competition, stock horse breeds {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse and Appaloosa tend to be {{favored by}} the judges, though quality {{individuals}} from other breeds such as the Morgan horse and Arabian horse can be competitive if not penalized for their natural conformation that gives them a somewhat higher-set neck. [...] "Gaited" [...] breeds such as the Missouri Fox Trotter and the Tennessee Walker often have their own Western Pleasure classes with standards adapted to evaluate their use of intermediate gaits other than the jog <b>trot.</b> <b>Even</b> breeds that are traditionally shown mostly in English riding disciplines, such as the American Saddlebred or the Friesian, may offer western pleasure classes with judging specifications that are adapted to the conformation and way of going of those breeds.|$|R
60|$|Before it {{had been}} long dark, we had crossed the range and into the {{department}} of Minas. Nothing happened till towards midnight, when our horses began to be greatly distressed. My companions hoped to reach before morning an estancia, still many leagues distant, where they were known and {{would be allowed to}} lie in concealment for a few days till the storm blew over; for usually shortly after an outbreak has been put down an indulto, or proclamation of pardon, is issued, after which it is safe for all those who have taken arms against the constituted government to return to their homes. For the time we were, of course, outlaws, and liable to have our throats cut at any moment. Our poor horses at last became incapable <b>even</b> of a <b>trot,</b> and, dismounting, we walked on, leading them by the bridles.|$|R
60|$|He {{went into}} the shed and Trot went to her mother. Mrs. Griffith, busy with her work, knew nothing {{of what was going}} on in regard to the flight of the Magic Umbrella. She never objected when Trot wanted to go away with Cap'n Bill for a day's picnicking. She knew the child was {{perfectly}} safe with the old sailor, who cared for <b>Trot</b> <b>even</b> better than her mother would have done. If she had asked any questions today and had found out they intended to fly in the air, she might have seriously objected, but Mrs. Griffith had her mind on other things and merely told the girl to take what she wanted from the cupboard and not bother her. So Trot, remembering that Button-Bright would be with them and had proved himself to be a hearty eater, loaded the basket with all the good things she could find.|$|R
60|$|We {{started on}} foot, leaving the horses hobbled near camp. All the hounds {{appeared}} fit. <b>Even</b> Old Dan <b>trotted</b> along friskily. Pyle, {{a neighbor of}} Haught's, had come to take a hunt with us, bringing two dogs with him. For this last day I had formulated a plan. Edd {{and one of the}} boys were to take the hounds down {{on the east side of}} the great ridge that made the eastern wall of Dude Canyon. R.C. was to climb out on this ridge, and take his position at the most advantageous point. We had already chased half a dozen bears over this saddle, one of which was the big frosty-coated grizzly that Edd and Nielsen had shot at. The rest of us hurried to the head of Dude Canyon. Copple and I were to go down to the first promontories under the rim. The others were to await developments and go where Haught thought best to send them.|$|R
6000|$|He was a {{wonderful}} man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color, and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was missing, from the knee down, {{and that was why}} the sailor no longer sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land, or <b>even</b> to take <b>Trot</b> out for a row or a sail on the ocean, {{but when it came to}} [...] "runnin' up aloft" [...] or performing active duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{catch up}} again with him till well outside the gate. I had <b>even</b> to <b>trot</b> {{a bit at}} the last, but when, out of breath at his elbow, I taxed him with running away, he said, [...] "Never!" [...] and at once turned at bay. I {{explained}} I never meant {{to say he was}} running away from me. [...] "From no man--from not a single man on earth," [...] he affirmed with a stubborn mien. I forbore to point out the one obvious exception which would hold good for the bravest of us; I thought he would find out by himself very soon. He looked at me patiently while I was thinking of something to say, but I could find nothing {{on the spur of the}} moment, and he began to walk on. I kept up, and anxious not to lose him, I said hurriedly that I couldn't think of leaving him under a false impression of my--of my--I stammered. The stupidity of the phrase appalled me while I was trying to finish it, but the power of sentences has nothing to do with their sense or the logic of their construction. My idiotic mumble seemed to please him. He cut it short by saying, with courteous placidity that argued an immense power of self-control or else a wonderful elasticity of spirits--"Altogether my mistake." [...] I marvelled greatly at this expression: he might have been alluding to some trifling occurrence. Hadn't he understood its deplorable meaning? [...] "You may well forgive me," [...] he continued, and went on a little moodily, [...] "All these staring people in court seemed such fools that--that it might have been as I supposed." ...|$|R
