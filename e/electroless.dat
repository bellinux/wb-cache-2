5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard <b>electroless</b> nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

25|$|Thiourea {{is used in}} the Clifton-Phillips and Beaver {{bright and}} semi-bright {{electroplating}} processes. It is also used in a solution with tin(II) chloride as an <b>electroless</b> tin plating solution for copper printed circuit boards.|$|E
25|$|Chemical etching {{is usually}} done with {{ammonium}} persulfate or ferric chloride. For PTH (plated-through holes), additional steps of <b>electroless</b> deposition are done after the holes are drilled, then copper is electroplated {{to build up}} the thickness, the boards are screened, and plated with tin/lead. The tin/lead becomes the resist leaving the bare copper to be etched away.|$|E
2500|$|Other platings {{used are}} OSP (organic surface protectant), {{immersion}} silver (IAg), immersion tin, <b>electroless</b> nickel with immersion gold coating (ENIG), <b>electroless</b> nickel <b>electroless</b> palladium immersion gold (ENEPIG) and direct gold plating (over nickel). [...] Edge connectors, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{convenient}} reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. [...] Thus, {{it is used}} as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. [...] It {{is also used to}} reduce metal salts and oxides to the pure metals in <b>electroless</b> nickel plating and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. [...] Some colour photographic processes also use a weak solution of hydrazine as a stabilizing wash, as it scavenges dye coupler and unreacted silver halides. Hydrazine is the most common and effective reducing agent used to convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via hydrothermal treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Its main {{industrial}} use is for <b>electroless</b> nickel plating (Ni–P), {{although it is}} primarily used as a salt (sodium hypophosphite). In organic chemistry, [...] H3PO2 {{can be used for}} the reduction of arenediazonium salts, converting [...] to Ar–H. [...] When diazotized in a concentrated solution of hypophosphorous acid, an amine substituent can be removed from arenes, selectively over alkyl amines. Owing to its ability to act as a mild reducing agent and oxygen scavenger it is sometimes used as an additive in Fischer esterification reactions, where it prevents the formation of colored impurities. Hypophosphorous acid is also used in the formulation of pharmaceuticals, discoloration of polymers, water treatment, retrieval of precious or non-ferrous metals.|$|E
2500|$|Debate {{over the}} corona's finish {{continued}} into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the scrim, as {{it created a}} [...] "shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions" [...] and [...] "conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty". Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting {{that it had a}} [...] "putty-like appearance under overcast conditions" [...] and visually fell [...] "far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design". A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration. <b>Electroless</b> plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A physical vapor deposition process involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF). This coating was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts on February 20, 2014, and by the National Capital Planning Commission in April 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through physical vapor deposition techniques, electrodeposition or <b>electroless</b> deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} dithiol SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or photoinduced processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained substitutional self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second assembly phase is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electroless</b> {{nickel plating}} layers {{are known to}} provide extreme surface {{adhesion}} when plated properly. <b>Electroless</b> nickel plating is non-magnetic and amorphous. <b>Electroless</b> nickel plating layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another <b>electroless</b> nickel-plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits <b>electroless</b> nickel-plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electroless</b> nickel is no {{different}} than its electroplated counterparts in that it is only as strong as the weakest link in the process cycle.

50|$|<b>Electroless</b> nickel plating, {{also known}} as enickel and NiP, offers many advantages: uniform layer {{thickness}} over most complicated surfaces, direct plating of ferrous metals (steel), superior wear and corrosion resistance to electroplated nickel or chrome. Much of the chrome plating done in aerospace industry can be replaced with <b>electroless</b> nickel plating, again environmental costs, costs of hexavalent chromium waste disposal and notorious tendency of uneven current distribution favor <b>electroless</b> nickel plating.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electroless</b> plating, {{also known}} as {{chemical}} or auto-catalytic plating, is a non-galvanic plating method that involves several simultaneous reactions in an aqueous solution, which occur {{without the use of}} external electrical power. The reaction is accomplished when hydrogen is released by a reducing agent, normally sodium hypophosphite (Note: the hydrogen leaves as a hydride ion) or thiourea, and oxidized, thus producing a negative charge {{on the surface of the}} part. The most common <b>electroless</b> plating method is <b>electroless</b> nickel plating, although silver, gold and copper layers can also be applied in this manner, as in the technique of Angel gilding.|$|E
