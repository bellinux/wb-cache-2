25|$|The {{state of}} New York, {{which also has}} a civil law history from its Dutch colonial days, began a {{codification}} of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete {{is known as the}} Field Code applying to civil procedure. The original colony of New Netherland was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was recaptured by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique {{in the history of the}} British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the patroon system of land holding, based on the feudal system and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of Roman-Dutch law continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of <b>general</b> <b>obligations</b> shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.|$|E
2500|$|The {{essential}} {{principles of}} English contract law, however, remained stable and familiar, as an offer for certain terms, mirrored by an acceptance, supported by consideration, and free from duress, undue influence or misrepresentation, would generally be enforceable. The rules were codified and exported across the British Empire, as {{for example in}} the Indian Contract Act 1872. Further requirements of fairness in exchanges between unequal parties, or <b>general</b> <b>obligations</b> of good faith and disclosure {{were said to be}} unwarranted because it was urged by the courts that liabilities [...] "are not to be forced upon people behind their backs". Parliamentary legislation, outside general codifications of commercial law like the Sale of Goods Act 1893, similarly left people to the harsh realities of the market and [...] "freedom of contract". This only changed when the property qualifications to vote for members of parliament were reduced and eliminated, as the United Kingdom slowly became more democratic.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be argued that in a democracy, because the {{government}} is the party performing the act of imposing taxes, {{society as a whole}} decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution's [...] "No taxation without representation" [...] slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the <b>general</b> <b>obligations</b> of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, [...] "An old tax is a good tax". Conservatives advocate the [...] "fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government 'services'." [...] Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision {{of a wide range of}} services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Tony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. Many libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty.|$|E
40|$|The City of Detroit's {{filing for}} {{municipal}} bankruptcy in July, 2013, {{has added to}} a continuing controversy of whether <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders have a secured lien. The City of Detroit claimed its <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders {{did not have a}} fully secured lien because the law of the state of Michigan did not create a statutory lien. Without the creation of a lien by state law, during the insolvency or bankruptcy of municipalities, <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders will potentially have a mere promise to pay versus a binding obligation to pay, and therefore, will not have a secured lien. Treating otherwise secured <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds as unsecured will create more risk for investors and increase the cost of borrowing for cities. This article discusses the treatment of <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds in recent municipal bankruptcies; identifies the states that create a binding <b>obligation</b> to pay <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders; describes problems of not treating <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds as secured; and proposes that states create clear laws that grant statutory liens for <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders...|$|R

60|$|There was a {{struggle}} {{in the mind of}} the young commander, between his duty and his feelings. Remembering the artifice by which he had formerly fallen into the power of the smugglers, he had taken his precautions so well in the present visit to the villa, that he firmly believed he had the person of his lawless rival at his mercy. To avail himself of this advantage, or to retire and leave him in possession of his mistress and his liberty, was the point mooted in his thoughts. Though direct and simple in his habits, like most of the seamen of that age, Ludlow had all the loftier sentiments that become a gentleman. He felt keenly for Alida, and he shrunk, with sensitive pride, from incurring the imputation of having acted under the impulses of disappointment. To these motives of forbearance, was also to be added the inherent reluctance which, as an officer of rank, he felt to the degradation of being employed in a duty that more properly belongs to men of less elevated ambition. He looked on himself as a defender of the rights and glory of his sovereign, and not as a mercenary instrument of those who collected her customs; and though he would not have hesitated to incur any rational hazard, in capturing the vessel of the smuggler, or in making captives of all or any of her crew on their proper element, he disliked the appearance of seeking a solitary individual on the land. In addition to this feeling, there was his own pledge that he met the proscribed dealer in contraband on neutral ground. Still the officer of the Queen had his orders, and he could not shut his eyes to the <b>general</b> <b>obligations</b> of duty. The brigantine was known to inflict so much loss on the revenue of the crown, more particularly in the other hemisphere, that an especial order had been issued by the Admiral of the station, for her capture. Here then was an opportunity of depriving the vessel of that master-spirit which, notwithstanding the excellence of its construction, had alone so long enabled it to run the gauntlet of a hundred cruisers with impunity. Agitated by these contending feelings and reflections, the young sailor left the door of the villa, and came upon its little lawn, in order to reflect with less interruption, and, indeed, to breathe more freely.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledges at {{the local}} {{government}} level include a pledge to levy a property tax to meet debt service requirements, in which case holders of <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds {{have a right to}} compel the borrowing government to levy that tax to satisfy the local government's obligation. Because property owners are usually reluctant to risk losing their holding due to unpaid property tax bills, credit rating agencies often consider a <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledge to have very strong credit quality and frequently assign them investment grade ratings. If local property owners do not pay their property taxes on time in any given year, a government entity is required to increase its property tax rate by as much as is legally allowable in a following year to make up for any delinquencies. In the interim between the taxpayer delinquency and the higher property tax rate in the following year, the <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledge requires the local government to pay debt service coming due with its available resources.|$|R
