25|$|A gastric {{peptic ulcer}} is a mucosal {{perforation}} which penetrates the muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, usually produced by acid-pepsin aggression. Ulcer margins are perpendicular and present chronic gastritis. During the active phase, {{the base of}} the ulcer shows 4 zones: <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis, inflammatory exudate, granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. The fibrous base of the ulcer may contain vessels with thickened wall or with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Small vessel disease {{involves}} the smaller arteries inside the brain: {{branches of the}} circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and basilar artery. Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): lipohyalinosis (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel {{as a result of}} high blood pressure and aging) and <b>fibrinoid</b> degeneration (a stroke involving these vessels are known as a lacunar stroke) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques).|$|E
25|$|The atherosclerotic, hypertension-related {{vascular}} lesions in {{the kidney}} primarily affect the preglomerular arterioles, resulting in ischemic {{changes in the}} glomeruli and postglomerular structures. Glomerular injury {{may also be a}} consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries due to glomerular hyperperfusion. Glomerular pathology progresses to glomerulosclerosis, and eventually the renal tubules may also become ischemic and gradually atrophic. The renal lesion associated with malignant hypertension consists of <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis of the afferent arterioles, sometimes extending into the glomerulus, and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.|$|E
30|$|The {{most intense}} {{luminescence}} is {{observed in the}} maternal erythrocytes and fetal erythrocytes, {{as well as in}} the intervillous <b>fibrinoids.</b> Less intense, but still well defined, luminescence is seen in the syncytiotrophoblast and endotheliocytes of the blood vessels of the chorial villi which are preliminarily identified as stromal cells, taking into account the dimensions, forms, and the specific characteristics of the location (most reliably, with due regard for the term of pregnancy—fibroblasts).|$|R

25|$|HUS occurs after 3–7% of all {{sporadic}} E. coli O157:H7 {{infections and}} up to approximately 20% or more of epidemic infections. Children and adolescents are commonly affected. Grossly, the kidneys may show patchy or diffuse renal cortical necrosis. Histologically, the glomeruli show thickened and sometimes split capillary walls due largely to endothelial swelling. Large deposits of fibrin-related materials in the capillary lumens, subendothelially, and in the mesangium are also found along with mesangiolysis. Interlobular and afferent arterioles show <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis and intimal hyperplasia and are often occluded by thrombi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the histopathological changes of the spleen caused by parasite infection and steroid use to investigate pathologi-cal effects due to infection in ICR mice. The mice were divided into 5 groups: non-malaria infected mice served as controls, mice with parasite infection only, and the other three groups; mice that were injected with dexamethasone (Dex) only, mice injected with Dex prior to and mice injected with Dex after malaria inocula-tion. Differences in spleen color between the groups were found. Compared to controls, malaria infected mice, and those injected with Dex only were signifi-cantly different (p < 0. 05) in spleen weights and sizes. Histological changes were also seen in these two groups. Fused white pulps were found in the spleens of mice infected with malaria only, clear zones of white and red pulp were observed in the spleens of mice treated only with Dex; <b>fibrinoids</b> were also found in this group. The histology of spleens appeared normal except for infiltration by numer-ous megakaryocytes in the spleens of mice given Dex before or after parasite in-oculation. Infection with malaria and use of Dex leads to destruction of typical features of spleen morphology and histology. However, uptake of Dex after ma-laria infection seems to reverse the pathology of the spleen. Key words: malaria, dexamethasone, spleen, histolog...|$|R
2500|$|The {{rheumatoid}} nodule, {{which is}} {{sometimes in the}} skin, {{is the most common}} non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a [...] "necrotizing granuloma". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.|$|E
5000|$|Within the decidua, {{occasional}} <b>fibrinoid</b> deposits form {{where the}} syncytiotrophoblast is damaged. The region of <b>fibrinoid</b> deposition where trophoblasts meet the compact {{portion of the}} decidua basalis is called Rohr's layer, while the <b>fibrinoid</b> deposits that occur between the compact and spongy layer of the decidua basalis is termed Nitabuch's layer. This layer is absent in placenta accreta.The decidua has a histologically-distinct appearance, displaying large polygonal decidual cells in the stroma. These are enlarged endometrial stromal cells, which resemble epithelium (and {{are referred to as}} [...] "epithelioid").|$|E
50|$|In {{small vessel}} vasculitis, fibrin plugs {{frequently}} {{occur in the}} vessel lumen, but the term <b>fibrinoid</b> is usually {{used to refer to}} material outside the lumen of a vessel. <b>Fibrinoid</b> necrosis also occurs in the walls of arterioles in malignant hypertension (blood pressure greater than 200/130 mmHg).|$|E

50|$|Although {{they are}} usually {{indicative}} of <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis associated with malignant hypertension, Siegrist streaks also occur in patients with temporal arteritis. They are named after Swiss ophthalmologist, August Siegrist (1865-1947).|$|E
50|$|Common sites {{undergoing}} <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis are, SLE, Aschoff bodies seen in rheumatic heart disease, Arthus reaction, serum sickness, polyarteritis nodosa, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, hyperacutely rejected grafts, malignant hypertension (>200/130 mm Hg).|$|E
50|$|Malignant nephrosclerosis {{occurs in}} {{presence}} of malignant hypertension (when DBP > 130mmHg). Vessels feature intimal thickening, <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis, {{red blood cell}} fragmentation, extravasation, thrombosis. These changes create an exaggerated layered appearance (onion skinning).|$|E

50|$|<b>Fibrinoid</b> {{necrosis}} {{is a form}} of necrosis, or tissue death, {{in which}} there is accumulation of amorphous, basic, proteinaceous material in the tissue matrix with a staining pattern reminiscent of fibrin.

50|$|They are pathognomic foci of <b>fibrinoid</b> {{necrosis}} {{found in}} many sites, most often the myocardium. Initially they are surrounded by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells, but they are slowly replaced by a fibrous scar. Aschoff bodies are found in all the three layers of the heart, least chance in the pericardium.|$|E
50|$|Endothelial injury {{can occur}} as a {{consequence}} of severe elevations in blood pressure, with <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis of the arterioles following. The vascular injury leads to deposition of platelets and fibrin, and a breakdown of the normal autoregulatory function. Ischemia occurs as a result, prompting further release of vasoactive substances. This process completes the vicious cycle.|$|E
50|$|Most of the time, scleritis is {{not caused}} by an {{infectious}} agent. Histopathological changes are that of a chronic granulomatous disorder, characterized by <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis, infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. The granuloma is surrounded by multinucleated epitheloid giant cells and new vessels, {{some of which may}} show evidence of vasculitis.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the term}} {{histiocyte}} {{has been used}} for multiple purposes in the past, and some cells called [...] "histocytes" [...] do not appear to derive from monocytic-macrophage lines. (The term Histiocyte can also simply refer to a cell from monocyte origin outside the blood system, such as in a tissue (as in rheumatoid arthritis as palisading histiocytes surrounding <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis of rheumatoid nodules).|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "onion-skin" [...] is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} this form of blood vessel with thickened concentric smooth muscle cell layer and thickened, duplicated basement membrane. In malignant hypertension these hyperplastic changes are often accompanied by <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis of the arterial intima and media. These changes are most prominent in the kidney {{and can lead to}} ischemia and acute kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|A gastric {{peptic ulcer}} is a mucosal defect which penetrates the muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, {{produced}} by acid-pepsin aggression.

50|$|Histological {{examination}} of nodules {{shows that they}} consist of a shell of fibrous tissue surrounding a center of <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis. Pea-sized nodules have one centre. Larger nodules tend to be multilocular, with many separate shells or with connections between the necrotic centres. Individual necrotic centres may contain a cleft or several centres of necrosis may all open on to a large bursal pocket containing synovial fluid.|$|E
5000|$|Kawasaki disease {{presents}} with set {{of mouth}} symptoms, the most characteristic changes are the red tongue, swollen lips with vertical cracking and bleeding. The mucosa {{of the mouth}} and throat may be bright red, and the tongue may have a typical [...] "strawberry tongue" [...] appearance (marked redness with prominent gustative papillae). These mouth symptoms are caused by the typical necrotizing microvasculitis with <b>fibrinoid</b> necrosis.|$|E
5000|$|Microscopically, Aschoff {{bodies are}} areas of {{inflammation}} of the connective tissue of the heart, or focal interstitial inflammation. Fully developed Aschoff bodies are granulomatous structures consisting of <b>fibrinoid</b> change, lymphocytic infiltration, occasional plasma cells, and characteristically abnormal macrophages surrounding necrotic centres. Some of these macrophages may fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. Others may become Anitschkow cells or [...] "caterpillar cells", so named because of the appearance of their chromatin.|$|E
