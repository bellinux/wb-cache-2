40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to discuss how dynamic parameters of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> intended to transfer hydraulic power from a source of hydraulic power (a hydraulic pump) to an actuating device (a hydraulic motor) can affect operation of an avionic hydraulic drive. Avionic hydraulic drives are operated with fast-varying waveforms of flow intensities and pressures. It is why analysis of most hydraulic drive systems must take account of compressibility of working fluid and elasticity of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines.</b> It leads to a wave model for propagation of energy variation down a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> (a pipe). The paper deals with flow of a compressible liquid via a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> with flexible walls. Theoretical deliberations were successfully verified by experimental research studies that were carried out on a dedicated test bench, therefore the presented amplitude vs. frequency characteristic curves of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> could be obtained from both theoretical considerations and experimental research studied. The experimental research {{studies were carried out}} for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> terminated with a fixed flow restrictor alone and a flow restrictor combined with a hydraulic accumulator as well as for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> supplied from a source of constant pressure and terminated with a valve with adjustable flow together with a hydraulic accumulator. The theoretical calculations for the amplitude vs. frequency characteristic curve are based on a model for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> with its resistance depending on frequency...|$|R

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} power steering systems of motor vehicles, often unintended acoustic phenomena can result from certain driving situations. The acoustic phenomenon known as “rattling” is generated by impacts on the steering cylinder, if the car rides over bumps, kerb stones or similar obstacles. In special friction conditions between tyre and road surface during parking, a phenomenon called “shuddering” occurs and leads to strong vibrations. These are audible by the driver as noise, and sensory through shaky steering wheel torque. In this PhD thesis the reasons for rattling and shuddering are analysed. The design of two test benches afford {{easy access to the}} steering systems´ components and allow measurement equipment to be easily installed. Furthermore, the development of simulation models are used to study different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> designs of the steering system. With the simulation models, physical data can be calculated, which can not be measured at the test benches. A comparison between measured and simulated data then verifies the simulation models. To evaluate measured and simulated data of different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> designs, characteristic numbers are calculated and compared. Active components, to eliminate both phenomena, are worked out systematically and structured in a matrix of principle solutions. The choice of an intelligent switch element out of the matrix leads to the design of three prototype valves, which are installed in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> of the power steering system and analysed at the two test benches. Characteristic numbers of the three valve lines are calculated and compared to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> of the series. With the designed valve lines the rattling and shuddering problem can be solved...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> for remote control of electro-hydraulic servo drive (EHSD) with throttle control. This type of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> is designed as a backup to replace the electrical connections, which are used to control EHSD being remote from the site with devices located to form the control signals of any object. A disadvantage of electric connections {{is that they are}} sensitive to magnetic fields and thereby do not provide the required reliability of the remote control. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> have no this disadvantage and therefore are used in aircraft and other industrial systems. However, dynamic characteristics of hydraulic systems still have been investigated insufficiently in the case of transmitting control signals at a distance at which the signal may be distorted when emerging the wave processes. The article results of mathematical simulation, which are verified through physical experimentation, largely eliminate the shortcomings of said information. The mathematical model described in the paper is based on the theory of unsteady pressure compressible fluids. In the model there are formulas that provide calculation of frequency characteristics of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> under <b>hydraulic</b> oscillations of the laminar flow parameters of viscous fluid. A real mock-up of the system under consideration and an experimental ad hoc unit are used to verify the results of mathematically simulated hydraulic systems. Calculated logarithmic amplitude and phase frequency characteristics compared with those obtained experimentally prove, under certain conditions, the proposed theoretical method of calculation. These conditions have to ensure compliance with initial parameters of fluid defined under stationary conditions. The applied theory takes into consideration a non-stationary hydraulic resistance of the line when calculating frequency characteristics. The scientific novelty in the article material is presented in verification results of the mathematical model of the hydraulic system in the space-distributed parameters. </p...|$|R
