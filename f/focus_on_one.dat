5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese Buddhist Pantheon designates the {{multitude}} (the Pantheon) of various Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and lesser deities and eminent religious masters in Buddhism. A Buddhist Pantheon exists {{to a certain}} extent in Mahāyāna, but is especially characteristic of Vajrayana Esoteric Buddhism, including Tibetan Buddhism and especially Japanese Shingon Buddhism, which formalized it to a great extent. In the ancient Japanese Buddhist Pantheon, more than 3,000 Buddhas or deities have been counted, although nowadays most temples <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> Buddha and a few Bodhisattvas.|$|E
25|$|Psychodynamic {{psychotherapy}} (PP) {{are different}} types of psychotherapy, derived from psychoanalysis. The duration of psychodynamic psychotherapy is very different. It reaches from 10–25 sessions (short term psychodynamic psychotherapy) up to over 200 sessions. The main emphasis of these measures are very different. Similar treatment principles mainly <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> or several target problems by using the foundation of modern psychoanalytical theories. Results of meta-analysis show that psychodynamic psychotherapy has large effects {{in the treatment of}} personality disorders.

However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tanks at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking maneuvers and combined arms.|$|E

25|$|RPGs rival {{adventure}} {{games in}} terms of their rich storylines, in contrast to genres that do not rely upon storytelling such as sports games or puzzle games. Both genres also feature highly detailed characters, {{and a great deal of}} exploration. However, adventure games usually have a well-defined character, whereas while RPGs may do so, many allow the player to design their characters. Adventure games usually <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> character, whereas RPGs often feature an entire party. RPGs also feature a combat system, which adventure games usually lack. Whereas both adventure games and RPGs may focus on the personal or psychological growth of characters, RPGs tend to emphasize a complex eternal economy where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes.|$|E
25|$|Javas {{had nearly}} {{vanished}} {{by the end}} of the 20th century, having been pushed to fringes of the poultry world by the intense <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> or two breeds by commercial growers, and the introduction of innumerable new and exotic breeds to poultry fancy. Beginning in the 1990s, breeders and conservation organizations began to make a more concerted effort to save the Java. In particular, the Garfield Farm Museum in Illinois has played a pivotal role in the preservation of Javas in the 21st century. Beginning with Mottled and Black Javas, sports from the Garfield flock have revived the White variety. The Garfield Farm was also supported by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which hatched Java chicks as part of their exhibit on genetics.|$|E
