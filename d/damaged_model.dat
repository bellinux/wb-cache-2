INTRODUCTION This paper is focused on model-based structural damage detection methods, which make use of both a reference and a <b>damaged</b> <b>model</b> of the structure. The model-based damage detection methods can be categorized into methods which utilize a global model versus a localized one.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{construction}} method of non-homogeneous {{solutions for the}} traction problem of an elastic damaging bar. This bar has a softening behavior that obeys a gradient <b>damaged</b> <b>model.</b> The method is applicable {{for a wide range}} of brittle materials. For sufficiently long bars, we show that localization arises on sets whose length is proportional to the material internal length and with a profile that is also a material characteristic. From its onset until the rupture, the damage profile is obtained either in a closed form or after a simple numerical integration depending on the model. Thus, the proposed method provides definitions for the critical stress and fracture energy that can be compared with experimental results. We finally discuss some features of the global behavior of the bar such as the possibility of a snapback at the onset of damage. We point out the sensitivity of the responses to the parameters of the damage law. All these theoretical considerations are illustrated by numerical examples...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{constitutive}} model for porous ductile metals with spheroidal voids is investigated. The constitutive model {{used to describe}} void growth prior to void coalescence is the Gologanu-Leblond model which is a Gurson like model taking into account not only the void volume fraction but also the void shape. To describe ductile rupture, coalescence criteria {{have been added to}} this model. It has been shown that a critical porosity used in the Gurson model for the void coalescence stage is limited to a restricted range of triaxiality. In this work we describe the onset of coalescence using both the Thomason and the Brown and Embury criteria. The first one is a plastic limit load criterion, based on the mechanism of plastic localisation in the intervoid ligament. The second one is based on a simple geometric consideration to predict the fracture of the ligament between two voids. This model is implemented into a User Subroutine for Abaqus/Explicit.

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} induces {{damage in}} Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS). Therefore damage development in these steels shall be studied and {{incorporated in the}} simulations for accurate failure predictions in forming processes and for determination of the product properties after forming. An efficient anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> suitable for large scale metal forming applications has been developed. The standard Lemaitre anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> was modified to incorporate lower damage evolution under compression, strain rate dependency in damage and Material Induced Anisotropic Damage (MIAD).

40|$|The Lemaitre's {{continuum}} <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> is {{well known}} in the field of damage mechanics. The anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> given by Lemaitre is relatively simple, applicable to nonproportional loads and uses only four damage parameters. The hypothesis of strain equivalence is used to map the effective stress to the nominal stress. Both the isotropic and anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>models</b> from Lemaitre are implemented in an in-house implicit finite element code. The <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> is coupled with an elasto-plastic material model using anisotropic plasticity (Hill- 48 yield criterion) and strain-rate dependent isotropic hardening. The Lemaitre continuum <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> is based on the small strain assumption; therefore, the model is implemented in an incremental co-rotational framework to make it applicable for large strains. The damage dissipation potential was slightly adapted to incorporate a different damage evolution behavior under compression and tension. A tensile test and a low-cycle fatigue test were used to determine the damage parameters. The damage evolution was modified to incorporate strain rate sensitivity by making two of the damage parameters a function of strain rate. The model is applied to predict failure in a cross-die deep drawing process, which {{is well known}} for having a wide variety of strains and strain path changes. The failure predictions obtained from the anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>models</b> are in good agreement with the experimental results, whereas the predictions obtained from the isotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> are slightly conservative. The anisotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model</b> predicts the crack direction more accurately compared to the predictions based on principal stress directions using the isotropic <b>damage</b> <b>model.</b> The set of damage parameters, determined in a uniaxial condition, gives a good failure prediction under other triaxiality conditions...|$|R

40|$|A flight-weight, {{metallic}} {{thermal protection}} system (TPS) model applicable to Earth-entry and hypersonic-cruise vehicles {{was subjected to}} multiple cycles of both radiant and aerothermal heating in order to evaluate its aerothermal performance, structural integrity, and damage tolerance.

The model was subjected to 10 radiant heating tests and to 3 radiant preheat/aerothermal tests. Under radiant-heating conditions with a maximum surface temperature of 2050 R, the TPS performed as designed and limited the primary structure away from the support ribs to temperatures below 780 R. During the first attempt at aerothermal exposure, a failure in the panel-holder test fixture severely damaged the model. However, two radiant preheat/aerothermal tests were made with the <b>damaged</b> <b>model</b> to test its damage tolerance.

40|$|AbstractLinear static {{analysis}} with an alternate load path using dynamic amplification factor (DAF) {{is often used}} for redundancy and progressive collapse analysis of steel truss bridges to avoid using the more time-consuming dynamic analysis. This study presents an empirical equation to calculate the DAF {{for this type of}} analysis against the initial sudden member fracture. Currently, this analysis employs an approximate model with a single degree of freedom to calculate the DAF. With a 5 % damping ratio, the constant DAF of 1. 854 is used for all types of steel truss bridges. However, this approach is inaccurate because the DAF varies between bridges and with the location of the fractured members as well.

Two 3 D models were developed and analysed for acase-study building: one was designed for earthquake resistance according to Eurocode 8 (EC 8); the other was designed only for gravity loads according to codes and practice going back to the 1970 s. Several blast scenarios were considered and a two-step analysis procedure was used. Local analysis was carried out to identify columns directly failing under blast scenarios, whereas global pushdown analysis was performed on each 3 D <b>damaged</b> <b>model</b> to assess robustness. Dynamic increase factors at both material and structural levels were assumed. Flexural–shear interaction and limited strength of beam–column joints were also addressed in the case of EC 8 -nonconforming building. Local pressure–impulse analysis was carried out in addition to simplified static and dynamic analyses; the same numbers of collapsed columns were found for the EC 8 -conforming building, while static analysis was too conservative for the EC 8 -nonconforming building. Pressure–impulse diagrams let to predict residual load-carrying capacity of adjacent columns. Seismicdesigncriteria provided sufficient robustness only against some blast scenarios. In the case of EC 8 -nonconforming building, inclined beams in the staircase induced higher robustness against explosions occurring there and global ductility reduced under increasing load-bearing capacity. The latter can enhance by increasing longitudinal rebar in a way to avoid flexural–shear interaction, and/or reducing stirrup spacing...|$|E
