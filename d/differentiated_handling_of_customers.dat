40|$|In {{order to}} reach the EU 2020 goals for the climate, Danish {{vocational}} training units are currently {{in a process of}} institutional change triggered by the need of providing energy, and new process competences for the skilled and semiskilled workforce active in construction. The aim of the present paper is to analyze enablers and barriers for this institutional change. The vocational education system in Denmark is strongly institutionalised with unions, employer's associations and the schools in central roles. Drawing on institutional theory contributions on labour market -, educational - and professional institutions, the paper presents a study of institutional work inside and across schools and craft disciplines working in SMEs involved in new building and renovation with an energy aspect. Collaboration between four education committees for carpenters, masons, electricians and plumbers and interviews with seven companies come to focus on competences of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustainable innovation in SME. The anticipation of future building regulation of 2015 and 2020 creates an institutional pressure in education for change including <b>handling</b> <b>differentiated</b> demands <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> and contractors, not always just following regulation but occasionally ahead of it. At a time this needs to be balanced with customer needs with a comfort orientation and issues of cost and financing. The committees act in a contradictory, sometimes conservative manner in this change of institutions of knowing. In the future specialization will be supplemented by horizontal and vertical interdisciplinary and innovative competences integrating the complex process industrialized construction sector. Schools, teachers and digital teaching materials need be developed to support this change supported by front running companies and results from innovative building projects. The education committees in Denmark can have a leading role in this development and set high and motivational standards for the improvements. The analysis sees however a lot more barriers than enablers...|$|R

Avaliaram-se as características: resistência à difusão do vapor de água na folha (Rd), condutância estomática (Ce), transpiração, teor relativo de água na folha (TRA) e potencial de água na folha (Yf) das plantas de pimentão, além de temperatura e radiação solar fotossinteticamente ativa (PAR). Os resultados demonstraram que as plantas de pimentão apresentam alterações no mecanismo fisiológico em função das condições hidro-climáticas ocorrentes ao longo do dia. O horário entre 12 h e 14 h é o mais indicado para a realização de determinações fisiológicas em plantas onde se deseja comparar o efeito do manejo diferenciado da disponibilidade hídrica, devido ser intervalo onde as variações destas características são mínimas.

40|$|Abstract — Modern {{information}} and communication technologies offer a variety of support options for the efficient <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> relationships. CRM systems have been developed, which are designed to support the processes in the areas of marketing, sales and service. Along with technological progress, CRM systems are constantly changing, i. e. the systems are continually enhanced by new functions. However, not all functions are suitable for every company because of different frameworks and business processes. In this context the question arises whether or not CRM systems are widely used in Austrian companies and which business processes are most frequently supported by CRM systems. This paper aims to shed light on the popularity of CRM systems in Austrian companies in general and the use of different functions to support their daily business. First of all, the paper provides a theoretical overview of the structure of modern CRM systems and proposes a categorization of currently available software functionality for collaborative, operational and analytical CRM processes, which provides the theoretical background for the empirical study. Apart from these theoretical considerations, the paper presents the empirical results of a field survey on the use of CRM systems in Austrian companies and analyzes its findings.

They describe business objects such as e. g. customers, articles or suppliers which are represented in information systems using data records. Today, many companies employ several business applications, each with its own datasets, to support their business processes. As a rule, this involves heterogeneous information systems whose master data are often neither current nor consistent between systems.

Benefit potentials of master data management are thus {{to be found in the}} improvement <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> service (e. g. through an integrated view on customer interactions and product configurations) as well as in cost savings (e. g. through consistent and error-free processes) and increased productivity (e. g. through time savings in the creation of master data due to the electronic distribution).

These have been analysed using a set of tools developed to capture complex Interactions and priorities in managers' activities and roles. The first stage of the study identified an emergent framework of four sets of activities: Diagnosing, Routing, Resourclng and Archiving. In the second phase, the relationships between different management behaviours and their contexts are analysed using the framework. Analysis of the four 'Decision Centres' has allowed shared goals, customer value and the challenges that arise in proposal processes to be investigated. A new model of Front-End processes Incorporating the Decision Centres has been developed from this extensive study of practice.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how customer complaints regarding mobile terminals are handled and managed during the after-sales phase. Mobile communication devices have become essentials {{of daily life}} {{in most parts of}} the world. The annual increase in the number of mobile handsets produced and sold brings challenges in maintaining standards of performance in accordance with customer expectations. Such expectations give rise to the issues of device quality and service quality. By reviewing existing literature, four published articles, and a proceedings paper, this thesis analyzes the best strategy for improving the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> complaints regarding mobile terminals. The case studies in the articles employ different statistical methods for analyzing different variables and parameters that affect customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. The articles focus only on the customer-raised technical problems that are encountered in mobile terminals deployed in the field. The main customers in the current thesis are authorized service vendors that interact with terminal end-users. The statistical methods in the aforementioned articles are used to create a model that is useful for significantly optimizing problem resolution time. Results show that the perceived quality of problem resolution is closely associated with the perceived quality of problem description and perceived quality of the time spent in resolving problems. On the basis of the findings, several managerial implications are established. As a rule, training on new products should be provided to internal and external service staff to effectively manage the problems raised by customers in the field. Communication between mobile manufacturers and authorized vendors should be maintained on a regular and systematic manner to capture the business opportunities available to both parties. Such opportunities can be evaluated through panel analysis...|$|R
