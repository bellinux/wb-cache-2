50|$|The {{most common}} phosphenes are {{pressure}} phosphenes, caused by rubbing or applying pressure {{on or near}} the closed eyes. They have been known since antiquity, and described by the Greeks. The pressure mechanically stimulates the cells of the retina. Experiences include a darkening of the visual field that moves against the rubbing, a <b>diffuse</b> <b>colored</b> patch that also moves against the rubbing, a scintillating and ever-changing and deforming light grid with occasional dark spots (like a crumpling fly-spotted flyscreen), and a sparse field of intense blue points of light. Pressure phosphenes can persist briefly after the rubbing stops and the eyes are opened, allowing the phosphenes to be seen on the visual scene. Hermann von Helmholtz and others have published drawings of their pressure phosphenes. One example of a pressure phosphene is demonstrated by gently pressing the side of one's eye and observing a colored ring of light on the opposite side, as detailed by Isaac Newton.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a simple but}} {{effective}} specular highlight removal method using a single input image. Our method {{is based on a}} key observation- the maximum fraction of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>color</b> component (so called maximum diffuse chromaticity in the literature) in local patches in color images changes smoothly. Using this property, we can estimate the maximum diffuse chromaticity values of the specular pixels by directly applying low-pass filter to the maximum fraction of the color components of the original image, such that the maximum diffuse chromaticity values can be propagated from the diffuse pixels to the specular pixels. The <b>diffuse</b> <b>color</b> at each pixel can then be computed as a nonlinear function of the estimated maximum diffuse chromaticity. Our method can be directly extended for multi-color surfaces if edge-preserving filters (e. g., bilateral filter) are used such that the smoothing can be guided by the maximum diffuse chromaticity. But maximum diffuse chromaticity is to be estimated. We thus present an approximation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Recent development in fast bilateral filtering techniques enables our method to run over 200 Ã— faster than the state-of-the-art on a standard CPU and differentiates our metho...|$|E

These methods typically {{require the}} solution of a global optimization problem (over either the pixel grid or an intermediate tessellated representation) to produce the final image, making fully parallel implementation challenging. An alternative approach, inspired by global illumination, uses 2 D ray tracing to independently compute each pixel value.

We leverage an intermediate triangular representation with cubic patches to synthesize smooth images faithful to the per-pixel solution.

In this thesis, various systems were used to achieve this task, and a psychophysical paired comparison experiment was conducted to evaluate their performance. A pair of strobe lights arranged at 60 Â° from the normal {{on either side of}} the painting captured color information where the strobes produced either directional or diffuse illumination geometry. By adding a third strobe, arranging them 120 Â° apart annularly, and cross polarizing, <b>diffuse</b> <b>color</b> and surface normal maps were measured. A fourth strobe was added and the four lights were rearranged 90 Â° apart annularly, capturing similar data.

An overview of precomputed radiance transfer and spherical harmonics is also presented, {{as well as a}} short introduction to global illumination. The proposed method uses a low-order spherical harmonics basis to represent incident radiance and visibility on the hemisphere of a receiver point. Diffuse reflecting geometry and shadow casting geometry is represented as sets of spheres. The spheres of an object approximate its shape and <b>diffuse</b> surface <b>color</b> as seen from any viewpoint. In a first pass, the direct illumination of an object is projected to its spheres and stored along with an approximation of the <b>diffuse</b> surface <b>color</b> as SH vectors defined over the surface of each sphere.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of volumetric objects {{is still a}} difficult problem. Solid texture synthesis methods enable the design of volumes with homogeneous textures, but global features such as smoothly varying colors seen in vegetables and fruits are difficult to model. In this paper, we propose a representation called diffusion surfaces (DSs) to enable modeling such objects. DSs consist of 3 D surfaces with colors defined on both sides, such that the interior colors in the volume are obtained by <b>diffusing</b> <b>colors</b> from nearby surfaces. A straightforward way to compute color diffusion is to solve a volumetric Poisson equation with {{the colors of the}} DSs as boundary conditions, but it requires expensive volumetric meshing which is not appropriate for interactive modeling. We therefore propose to interpolate colors only locally at user-defined cross-sections using {{a modified version of the}} positive mean value coordinates algorithm to avoid volumetric meshing. DSs are generally applicable to model many different kinds of objects with internal structures. As a case study, we present a simple sketch-based interface for modeling objects with rotational symmetries that can also generate random variations of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through various DSs models with simple non-photorealistic rendering techniques enabled by DSs.

The diffuse components of both images are then used to obtain the surface normals of depicted objects by application of shape from shading algorithm (SFS). The robustness of the method is limited mostly by precise estimations of surface normals and the light direction needed to acquire a reflectance of depicted objects.

Our aim is to determine how variations in physical properties of young stellar objects (e. g., mass infall rate, disk size) affect their observed colors and morphology, and use this information to highlight observable differences between different evolutionary states. We show that the near-IR colors are a function of envelope mass infall rate and inclination; hence both parameters must be constrained if colors are to be used to infer a source's true evolutionary state. Sources with more opaque envelopes have redder <b>diffuse</b> <b>colors,</b> because the scattered light suffers reddening as it propagates through the envelope. Somewhat counterintuitively, colors are reddest at intermediate inclinations (i ~ 45 Â°- 70 Â°) and then become bluer edge-on, where light is ~ 100 % scattered. Thus a source with relatively blue colors could be an evolved source or a younger source oriented edge-on. Importantly, we find that at inclinations where scattered light dominates, it is erroneous to derive extinction A_V from observed colors; fully half of all objects will underestimate A_V by at least an order of magnitude. We use our models to interpret six protostellar sources in the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud observed with HST NICMOS. Of the six young stellar objects modeled in this paper, five require an infalling envelope to match the colors and should thus be classified as young embedded sources.
