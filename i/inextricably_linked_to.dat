5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> himself that it could not survive him.|$|E

In educational settings, Bloom's affective and cognitive taxonomies serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} {{computer}} security techniques practice today, cryptography {{has been identified}} {{as one of the most}} important solutions in the integrated digital security system. Cryptographic techniques such as encryption can provide very Long passwords that are not required to be remembered but are in turn protected by simple password, hence defecting their purpose. In this,paper, we proposed a novel two-stage technique to generate personalized cryptographic keys from the face biometric, which offers the <b>inextricably</b> <b>link</b> <b>to</b> its owner. At the first stage, integral transform of biometric input is to discretise to produce a set of bit representation with a set of tokenised pseudo random number, coined as FaceHash. In the second stage, FaceHash is then securely reduced to a single cryptographic key via Shamir secret-sharing. Tokenised FaceHashing is rigorously protective of the face data, with security comparable to cryptographic hashing of token and knowledge key-factor. The key is constructed to resist cryptanalysis even against an adversary who captures the user device or the feature descriptor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Failure of the South Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{to develop an}} effective political narrative and civil/military administration. Some of this failure {{grew out of the}} difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established, with a weak political and military organization that compared poorly with the well-oiled machine of the North. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, inefficient administration and military incompetence.

The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain.

25|$|In Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed {{films were}} used as {{propaganda}} tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad. One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was {{the driving force behind}} the film's production. The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s. However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media. For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura ("Aeropainting"). While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.|$|E

500|$|While this {{administrative}} structure was decreed {{by a government}} anxious to deal with [...] interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, {{the leader of the}} village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.|$|E

Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the politics of}} settler colonialism and indigeneity in Taiwan and Hokkaidō, Japan in the last {{one hundred and fifty}} years. I argue that the histories of these two settler colonial formations are <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> due <b>to</b> their shared experience of Japanese imperialism {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. By analyzing a wide range of archival materials such as newspaper accounts, legal texts, and government documents, I first trace the emergence of what I term "settler colonial biopower" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and its mutations in the immediate postwar period on both islands. This mode of settler colonial power, however, has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of multiculturalism over the last few decades.

40|$|Submitted to the Undergraduate Library Research Award {{scholarship}} competition: 2012 - 2013. 24 pagesAlthough {{not well}} known, Oregon’s intentional communities date back {{over one hundred}} and fifty years. Oregon communalism reached its peak in the 1970 s when there was a huge growth in lesbian intentional communities in Southern Oregon. These communities developed out of the back-to-the-land movement and the women’s movement. However, besides thinking about communalism and women’s liberation, the women were also harkening back to a long-held component of American cultural mythology: the pastoral ideal. Pastoral idealism, or the idea that a simple, egalitarian, and spiritually pure life is possible in the countryside, has been a driving force in American writing and cultural movements. Although the members of intentional communities attempted to isolate themselves from patriarchal American culture, their writings demonstrate continued engagement with pastoral idealism. In doing so, these women <b>inextricably</b> <b>linked</b> themselves <b>to</b> American culture and must be seen as part of America’s history of idealism, communalism and activism...|$|R
