40|$|Continuous chips {{removed by}} single point diamond turning of single crystal silicon have been {{investigated}} by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy/Transmission Electron Microscopy and micro-Raman Spectroscopy. Three different chip structures were probed {{with the use of}} electron diffraction pattern: (i) totally amorphous lamellar structure, (ii) amorphous structure with remnant crystalline material and, (iii) partially amorphous together with amorphous with remnant crystalline material. Furthermore, micro-Raman spectroscopy from the chips left in the cutting tool rake face showed different silicon phases. We have found, from a detailed analysis of the debris, five different structural phases of silicon in the same debris. It is proposed that material removal mechanisms may change along the cutting edge from shearing (yielding lamellar structures) to extrusion. Shearing results from structural changes related to phase transformation induced by pressure and shear deformation. Extrusion, yielding crystalline structures in the chips, may be attributed to a pressure drop (due to an increase in the contact area) from the tool tip towards the region of the cutting edge where brittle-to-ductile transition occurs. From this region upwards, pressure(stress) would be insufficient to trigger phase transformation and therefore amorphous phase would not <b>form</b> <b>integrally</b> along the chip width...|$|R
40|$|Infrared image sensors {{based on}} high density {{rectangular}} planar arrays of nano tunnel junctions have been proposed. These sensors would differ fundamentally from prior infrared sensors based, variously, on bolometry or conventional semiconductor photodetection. Infrared image sensors based on conventional semiconductor photodetection must typically be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to reduce noise to acceptably low levels. Some bolometer-type infrared {{sensors can be}} operated at room temperature, but they exhibit low detectivities and long response times, which limit their utility. The proposed infrared image sensors could be operated at room temperature without incurring excessive noise, and would exhibit high detectivities and short response times. Other advantages would include low power demand, high resolution, and tailorability of spectral response. Neither bolometers nor conventional semiconductor photodetectors, the basic detector units as proposed would partly resemble rectennas. Nanometer-scale tunnel junctions would be created by crossing of nanowires with quantum-mechanical-barrier layers {{in the form of}} thin layers of electrically insulating material between them (see figure). A microscopic dipole antenna sized and shaped to respond maximally in the infrared wavelength range that one seeks to detect would be <b>formed</b> <b>integrally</b> with the nanowires at each junction. An incident signal in that wavelength range would become coupled into the antenna and, through the antenna, to the junction. At the junction, the flow of electrons between the crossing wires would be dominated by quantum-mechanical tunneling rather than thermionic emission. Relative to thermionic emission, quantum mechanical tunneling is a fast process...|$|R
40|$|The copper- 8 {{atomic percent}} chromium- 4 atomic percent niobium (CuCrNb) alloy was {{developed}} by Glenn Research Center (formally Lewis Research Center) as an improved alloy for combustion chamber liners. In comparison to NARloy-Z, the baseline (as in Space Shuttle Main Engine) alloy for such liners, CuCrNb demonstrates mechanical and thermophysical properties equivalent to NARloy-Z, but at temperatures 100 C to 150 C (180 F to 270 F) higher. Anticipated materials related benefits include decreasing the thrust cell liner weight 5 % to 20 %, increasing the service life at least two fold over current combustion chamber design, and increasing the safety margins available to designers. By adding an oxidation and thermal barrier coating to the liner, the combustion chamber can operate at even higher temperatures. For all these benefits, however, this alloy cannot be formed using conventional casting and forging methods because of the levels of chromium and niobium, which exceed their solubility limit in copper. Until recently, the only forming process that maintains the required microstructure of CrNb intermetallics is powder metallurgy formation of a billet from powder stock, followed by extrusion. This severely limits its usefulness in structural applications, particularly the complex shapes required for combustion chamber liners. Vacuum plasma spray (VPS) has been demonstrated as a method to form structural articles including small combustion chambers from the CuCrNb alloy. In addition, an oxidation and thermal barrier layer can be <b>formed</b> <b>integrally</b> on the hot wall of the liner that improve performance and extend service life. This paper discusses the metallurgy and thermomechanical properties of VPS formed CuCrNb versus the baseline powder metallurgy process, and the manufacturing of small combustion chamber liners at Marshall Space Flight Center using the VPS process. The benefits to advanced propulsion initiatives of using VPS to fabricate combustion chamber liners while maintaining the superior CuCrNb properties are also presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA shear hydro-bending {{process was}} {{proposed}} {{to form the}} titanium alloys tubes with small bending radius, {{which can not be}} <b>integrally</b> <b>formed</b> by the conventional bending methods. Numerical simulation and experimental research were conducted to investigate effects of internal pressure and feeding ratio on defects, strain state and thickness distribution. The results show that the sound part can be successfully manufactured as the internal pressure ranges from 0. 2 σs to 0. 6 σs and the feeding ratio ranges from 1. 0 to 1. 3, while the defects occur if the internal pressure and the feeding ratio exceed to these scopes. The strain state of the inner and outer sides of the bend are tensile and compressive, and the thicknesses are thinning and thickening, respectively, which is influenced prominently by the internal pressure and the feeding ratio. The strain state of the lateral side is shear and the thickness is generally invariable. It can be conducted that shear hydro-bending method is suitable to manufacture the titanium alloys tube with small bending radius. There is a process window for the internal pressure and the feeding ratio, in which the tubes can be successfully formed without defects...|$|E

The knowledge of cell geometry the reupon allows the characterization of cell deformation due to varying impact loads.

Finally the restrictions of the methods are outlined and discussed with respect to the application range and application possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} decade, {{hydroformed}} structural components {{have been widely}} used in industrial areas in North American and Europe and there is a large potential market in Asia with the development of automotive industry. An extraordinary feature of tube hydroforming is that a hollow component with a three dimension axis and variable closed-sections can be <b>integrally</b> <b>formed,</b> so that the number of component parts is minimized, weight is reduced and stiffness of the part is increased. The section shapes in many automotive hollow components are complex and it is usually difficult or impossible to hydroform these typical sections directly from circular section tube, so that satisfactory preforms are necessary. In this paper, a method to reduce the friction and calibration pressure through a petal-like cross-section shape preform is presented and its mechanism is analyzed. Preforms for rectangular, trapezoidal and polygonal sections used in hollow components are investigated and satisfactory preforms are obtained. Taking an engine cradle as example, satisfactory preform section shapes have been designed, by which the thickness distribution was controlled and the flash generated from the die-parting surface in the final forming was avoided. So a carefully selected preform process can contribute significantly to the reduction of friction and calibration pressure and it is a dominant factor for successful hydroforming...|$|E

Optionally, solid panel face sheets can be <b>formed</b> <b>integrally</b> during casting. In either form, lattice block panels can easily be produced with weights less than 25 percent {{of the mass of}} a solid panel. Inconel 718 (IN 718) and MarM- 247 superalloy lattice block panels have been developed under NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Project and Higher Operating Temperature Propulsion Components Project {{to take advantage of the}} superalloys' high strength and elevated temperature capability with the inherent light weight and high stiffness of the lattice architecture (ref. 1). These characteristics are important in the future development of turbine engine components. Casting quality and structural efficiency were evaluated experimentally using small beam specimens machined from the cast and heat treated 140 - by 300 - by 11 -mm panels. The matrix of specimens included samples of each superalloy in both open-celled and single-face-sheet configurations, machined from longitudinal, transverse, and diagonal panel orientations. Thirty-five beam subelements were tested in Glenn's Life Prediction Branch's material test machine at room temperature and 650 C under both static (see the following photograph) and cyclic load conditions. Surprisingly, test results exceeded initial linear elastic analytical predictions. This was likely a result of the formation of plastic hinges and redundancies inherent in lattice block geometry, which was not considered in the finite element models. The value of a single face sheet was demonstrated by increased bending moment capacity, where the face sheet simultaneously increased the gross section modulus and braced the compression ligaments against early buckling as seen in open-cell specimens. Preexisting flaws in specimens were not a discriminator in flexural, shear, or stiffness measurements, again because of redundant load paths available in the lattice block structure.

BackgroundPotential backfiltration of cytokine-inducing material is a clinical concern during hemodialysis conducted with high-flux membranes. Novel hollow-fiber membranes were developed that had asymmetric convective solute transport properties, {{aimed at reducing}} the passage of potentially harmful molecules from dialysate to blood, while maintaining the desired fluid and solute movement from blood to dialysate. MethodsSieving coefficient {{as a function of}} molecular weight was measured in vitro using polydisperse dextrans. Measurements were conducted using two different flat-sheet membranes in series or using hollow fiber membranes having two <b>integrally</b> <b>formed</b> skin layers. Based on measured experimental parameters, model calculations simulated the performance of a clinical-scale dialyzer containing these new membranes versus that of a commercially available high-flux dialyzer. ResultsAsymmetric convective solute transport was demonstrated using both commercial flat-sheet and newly developed hollow-fiber membranes. For two flat-sheet membranes in series, the extent of asymmetric transport was dependent on the order in which the solution was filtered through the membranes. For the hollow-fiber membranes, the nominal molecular weight cut-off was 20 kD in the blood-to-dialysate direction and 13 kD in the dialysate-to-blood direction. For this membrane, model calculations predict that clearance of a β 2 -microglobulin–sized molecule (11, 800 D) would be significantly greater from blood to dialysate than in the reverse direction, even under conditions of zero net ultrafiltration. ConclusionA novel hollow-fiber dialysis membrane was developed that allows greater convective solute transport from blood to dialysate than from dialysate to blood...|$|E
