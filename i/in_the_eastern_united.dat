5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939.

In addition, temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{with its}} {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property.

5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have shown it to be common in oak forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States.

American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their hub in Nashville in April 1986. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight to from Nashville to London (flying into Gatwick Airport). The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} North America, Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{distinctive}} and easily recognizable. Two {{other species of}} Calostoma also occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has a reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E

5|$|Bothia is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Boletaceae. A {{monotypic}} genus, it contains the single species Bothia castanella, a bolete mushroom first described scientifically in 1900 from collections made in New Jersey. Found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, Costa Rica, China, and Taiwan, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with oak trees. Its fruit body is chestnut brown, the cap is smooth and dry, and {{the underside of the}} cap has radially elongated tubes. The spore deposit is yellow-brown. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Historically, its unique combination of morphological features resulted in the transfer of B.castanella to six different Boletaceae genera. Molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2007, demonstrated that the species was genetically unique enough to warrant placement in its own genus.|$|E

Exsudoporus frostii is distributed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica.
