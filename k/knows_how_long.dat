[...] Allen told Billboard magazine, [...] "The video looks great. It was really fun shooting it-we shot it from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. so it was an all-night thing with no breaks. [...] set up like a digital clock, but it's huge, it's this monstrous thing-like 25 feet tall and who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> I get to hold a flare, which was pretty cool.

Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas {{to have a look}} at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest of this stuff is stayin' put for who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest}} of the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E

500|$|In August, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{the recording of}} its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly {{after the release of}} Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: [...] "You know, time is short. Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge {{surprisingly}} agreeable, {{and slowly}} became reconciled to her situation. [...] At {{the end of}} July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her {{that her mother was}} about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. [...] This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, [...] "for God <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> or what events may occur before we meet again". [...] Charlotte would never see her mother again. [...] In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. [...] She had asked to go to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. [...] As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, [...] "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen". [...] On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece [...] "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory". [...] Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. [...] She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would [...] "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence ... that man is the P of S-C" [...] In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she [...] "had a very sudden and great shock" [...] when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. [...] In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.|$|E
500|$|Server Sundaram {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema, and is believed by many critics to be Nagesh's breakthrough {{role as an}} actor and Balachander's first success in Tamil cinema. Actor Kamal Haasan compared his 2015 film Uttama Villain (which also starred Balachander) to Server Sundaram, finding it to be [...] "both emotional and humorous" [...] like the latter. The success of Server Sundaram led to many collaborations between Nagesh and Balachander, notable of which include Neerkumizhi (1965), Major Chandrakanth (1966), Ethir Neechal (1968) and Apoorva Raagangal (1975). Film historian Mohan V. Raman noted, [...] "By casting [...] in Server Sundaram, ... made the comedian a serious actor." [...] The film also became noted for introducing the anti-hero to Tamil cinema {{as well as the}} style of delivering short and fast-paced dialogues. A dialogue spoken by Nagesh's character, [...] "Long, long ago... so long ago, nobody <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago" [...] became popular. Balachander mentions the dialogue in Uttama Villain as a build-up to the film his character directs. Actor Appukutty worked in several hotels and restaurants as a cleaner and server before making his debut as the lead actor with Azhagarsamiyin Kuthirai (2011) which won him the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor; Kumar Chellappan of Daily News and Analysis compared this to the plot of Server Sundaram. Bharatiya Janata Party member L. Ganesan considered Server Sundaram to be an example [...] "of good Tamil cinema globally." [...] Following Nagesh's death in 2009, Sify ranked Server Sundaram fourth in its list, [...] "10 Best Films of late Nagesh", commenting, [...] "A hotel waiter becomes a superstar and the transformation is shown brilliantly by the actor." [...] Sri Lankan historian Sachi Sri Kantha included Server Sundaram in his list compiling [...] "the ten landmark Tamil movies, spanning all genres, which delighted the multitude of fans immensely". The sequence where Sundaram balances several vessels in one hand, referred to by the Hindustan Times Gautaman Bhaskaran as the [...] "dumara-tumbler" [...] sequence, attained popularity, as did the scene where Sundaram's mother realises that he is not a hotel manager but a waiter.|$|E

2500|$|This is a {{mathematical}} problem of solving a triangle. [...] If a navigator <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the ship has sailed on the erroneous course, he can calculate its current distance from its intended course, and estimate {{how long it}} must sail back on a new bearing until it recovers its old course. [...] In the Corsica-to-Genoa example, there is an implied triangle ACD, with one side given (AC = 70 miles on actual NW course), a 45° angle at A (angle of difference between actual course NW and intended course N) and another angle of 90° at C (angle of difference between actual course NW and return course NE). [...] The challenge to the navigator is to find how long one must sail on the NE return course (the length of side CD, {{what is called the}} ritorno) and how far one has advanced on the intended course by the time one straightens out (the length of the hypotenuse AD, or what is called the total avanzo).|$|E
2500|$|.....Then further west, The Tibetans {{encountered}} a distinctly foreign nation—Shangshung, with its capital at Khyunglung. Mt. Kailāśa (Tise) and Lake Manasarovar formed {{part of this}} country, whose language has come down to us through early documents. Though still unidentified, {{it seems to be}} Indo-European.... Geographically the country was certainly open to India, both through Nepal and by way of Kashmir and Ladakh. Kailāśa is a holy place for the Indians, who make pilgrimages to it. No one <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they have done so, but the cult may well go back to the times when Shangshung was still independent of Tibet. How far Zhangzhung stretched to the north, east and west is a mystery... We have already had an occasion to remark that Shangshung, embracing Kailāśa sacred Mount of the Hindus, may once have had a religion largely borrowed from Hinduism. The situation may even have lasted for quite a long time. In fact, about 950, the Hindu King of Kabul had a statue of Vişņu, of the Kashmiri type (with three heads), which he claimed had been given him by the king of the Bhota (Tibetans) who, in turn had obtained it from Kailāśa." ...|$|E
