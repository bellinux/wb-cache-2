5|$|While heparin was {{introduced}} <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use</b> {{in the late}} 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed.

40|$|Background. There is no {{consensus}} regarding the definition of frailty <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>uses.</b> Methods. A modified Delphi process was used to attempt to achieve consensus definition. Experts were selected from different fields and organized into five Focus Groups.

5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use.</b> Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E

25|$|Levodopa {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid-20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967, {{and the first}} large study reporting improvements in people with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with levodopa was published in 1968. Levodopa brought about {{a revolution in the}} management of PD.

25|$|Pantoprazole was {{identified}} after nearly {{seven years of}} research and registered <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use</b> after a further seven years of development, and finally reached its first market in 1994 in Germany.

Pantoprazole obtained high selection criteria in its development process—especially concerning the favorable low potential for interaction with other drugs. Good solubility of pantoprazole and a very high solution stability allowed it to become the first marketed PPI for intravenous use in critical care patients.|$|E
