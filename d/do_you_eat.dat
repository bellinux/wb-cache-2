Jacob came to me the other day, to make his court; but I told him it was too late, and that it was not my doing. I reckon they will lose it in a week or two. Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and as if we had seen one another yesterday; and Steele and I were very easy, though I writ him lately a biting letter, in answer to one of his, where he desired me to recommend a friend of his to Lord Treasurer. Go, get you gone to your waters, sirrah. Do they give you a stomach? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat</b> heartily?--We have had much rain to-day and yesterday.|$|E

40|$|Let us ask the {{following}} questions concerning any given mental process: (i) which are the reasons for its being, (ii) which are the ostensible characteristics of its evolution, (iii) which is the inner essence of the process, its identity, its suchness, and (iv) which are the relations between such why, how, and what. Sometimes these questions can be answered to our complete satisfaction: when somebody asks “Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat</b> the pie?” {{and the answer is}} “Because I was hungry” the exchange can at a neutral level be considered complete. But when one reflects further into the more profound reasons of anything that happens, then it is impossible to say if a good explanation can always be given concerning such why. Obvious answers to daily questions may satisfy our unreflecting curiosity, but not our deeper inquisitiveness...|$|R

There was an end of the subject." ...|$|R
