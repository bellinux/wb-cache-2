25|$|Lancia {{is renowned}} in the {{automotive}} world for introducing cars with numerous innovations. These include the Theta of 1913, {{which was the}} first European production car to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment. Lancia's first car adopting a monocoque chassis – the Lambda produced from 1922 to 1931 - featured 'Sliding Pillar' independent front suspension that incorporated the spring and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> into a single unit (a feature that would be employed in subsequent Lancia's, up to the Appia that was replaced in 1963). 1948 saw the first 5 speed gearbox to be fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia, after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first manufacturer to produce a V4 engine. Other innovations involved the use of independent suspension in production cars (in an era where live axles where common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car) and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia range. This drive for innovation, constant quest for excellence, fixation of quality, complex construction processes and antiqued production machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to increase extensively, while demand did not eventually affecting Lancia's viability.|$|E

An {{engine oil cooler}} (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an automatic choke. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath.

50|$|With his son Anders, Fisker started {{designing}} a new machine in 1932 and in 1934 they demonstrated a new Nimbus motorcycle, the Type C. It retained the shaft drive, a completely redesigned ohv and ohc engine of 18 (later 22) hp, and a frame made from steel strips riveted together, which were shaped {{to go around}} the gas tank much like on the pressed steel frames on several other motorcycles of the period. Front suspension was by telescopic fork; although this was introduced a year before the BMW R12, the R12's fork had <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> upon introduction while the Nimbus's fork did not have <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> until 1939. Its distinctive humming exhaust note led to it being nicknamed Humlebien ("The Bumblebee").|$|R

The SZ was originally equipped with Pirelli P Zero tyres (front 205/55 ZR 16, rear 225/50 ZR 16) and is able to sustain over 1.1 G in cornering, some drivers have measured a cornering force of 1.4 G, which remains an excellent performance figure.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Bentley to {{dispense}} with a leaf-sprung front beam axle. It followed Rolls-Royce's lead from 1936 and instead used a new design of independent front suspension in its completely new chassis. Low rate open coil springs sat within pairs of triangulated wishbones holding the front wheels at their outer point. The upper wishbones acted on a piston-type <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper,</b> the arms at the bottom were set wide apart so that the rearward one could act as a torque member under braking. These assemblies on each side were linked by a strong anti-roll bar.|$|E

Quick the FVA was awarded a research contract to develop an Automatische Wölbklappenverstellung für Segelflugzeuge (Automatic flap system for gliders), by the DFG (Deutschen Forschungs-Gemeinschaft - German research foundation). Using a system of hydraulic dampers, mass balances, rods and levers the flaps can be adjusted automatically to cater for stick movement, in pitch, and 'g'. Initial problems with sensitivity were resolved by changes to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper.</b> For the initial application the FVA was donated a VFW-Fokker FK-3 two-seat glider, into which the system was fitted. Results were very encouraging, with the system also being fitted to the Akaflieg München Mü28 aerobatic glider and a Rolladen-Schneider LS3a competition glider.|$|E

5000|$|HSFV1 was {{intended}} for fundamental empirical research into wheel-rail interaction and suspension dynamics to be better understood, following from work on wheel tread profiles. It was regularly run at speeds of up to 140 mph (225 km/h) on the Vehicles Laboratory's roller rig. It also performed at 90 mph whilst under test on the main line. Its suspension had two vertical coil springs and two vertical and one lateral <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> at each corner of the vehicle. This was {{at a time when}} few freight trains travelled at more than forty mph and most passenger trains averaged about seventy mph. It supported theories of vehicle design which led to most later designs of train.|$|E
50|$|Self-dumping grabs {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the grab closed. When the grab is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the grab to open when lifted. A lever may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a banksman, releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the grab to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper). The grab usually is fitted with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> to restrict the speed of opening. The clamshell bucket on the left hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a self-dumping chain grab.|$|E

5000|$|It was the Moors {{who brought}} with them to Ibiza the {{expertise}} and knowledge to turn dry parched land into usable fertile agricultural land. They constructed a complicated network of cisterns, reservoirs, waterwheels and irrigation canals. These schemes which included Ses Feixes transformed the original wetland into extremely productive land, by moving vast amounts of water away. This in turn gave the moors the water supply to free up the potential of dryer tracts of land. These schemes turned both wetland and the parched ground into fertile agricultural land. At Ses Feixes [...] These ingenious irrigation systems transformed the original wetland into extremely productive land, farmed until the late 1950s. Once the loose marshes soil of these wetlands had been reclaimed from the sea, a mosaic of long narrow plots (feixa or field) were created by running narrow canals (séquies) [...] around the plots. These plots or strips were then crossed laterally by underground drainage culverts (Fibles). These culverts kept the soil above well watered. At the entrance to each tract of land there was a distinctive gateway called a (Compuertas) which also acted, in some cases, as a <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>damper.</b> The gateways where built from rendered stone and whitewashed and are reminiscent of similar structures seen in ancient Egypt and the Middle East.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a modification to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> to utilize its energy {{lose in the}} form of heat. During the working of actual <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper,</b> when the suspension fluid is compressed inside the damper cylinder in order to absorb the vibration shocks,the frictional energy of the vehicle is dissipated as heat loss by the suspension fluid in order to minimise the effect of bumps and ridges in road. So in order to harness this power loss, we have developed an energy saving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> by modifying the existing model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper.</b> We create a separate flow path with rotating turbine parallel to the damping cylinder connecting the upper and lower end of damper. When the vehicle travels down from a bump, the coil spring compresses forcing the piston to push the suspension fluid upwards and this high pressure fluid travels through the flow path rotating the turbine which in turn runs the generator for power generation. A check valve is provided at the flow path end to prevent the fluid back flow. Thus the suspension fluid kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy by means of the turbine...|$|E

Newly developed Displacement Dependent Semi-Active <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Damper</b> (DSHD) is one of the hydraulic dampers. For this damper, the hydraulic cylinder is acting as a damper connector. This damper connector is like a flexible switch with tight-loose and close-open functions and is used to connect a structure and a resistance component. For a DSHD-added structure, to linearize the nonlinear behavior of DSHD is required for preliminary design. Using the damping ratio as a parameter, the DSHD is modeled as a fixture of a linear spring and linear viscous damper. This approach is valid for application in the engineering practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical damping {{systems have}} been widely used to various {{industrial}} structures and are mainly hydraulic and pneumatic devices nowadays. In this work, a novel damping system based on the colloidal suspension in the field of nanotechnology is investigated. The colloidal suspension consists of lyophobic working fluid and hydrophobic-coated porous particle. The mechanism of mechanical energy dissipation in damping system based on the colloidal suspension with nano-porous particles is {{different from that of the}} existing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> system. The damping system using colloidal suspension was studied by experimental equipment. The energy dissipation can be occurred in the case that compression time is different from that of relaxation. The sequence in the compression (loading) and relaxation (unloading) cycle plays an important role to control the performance on energy dissipation of mechanical damping system using colloid suspension with hydrophobic porous particle and working fluid. Consequently, it is noted that mechanical damping system using colloid suspension can be applicable in diverse mechanical structures under various loading condition and replace with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> system as an anti-vibration structure...|$|R
