40|$|Radar {{provides}} a useful and powerful tool to wildlife biologists and ornithologists. However, radar also {{has the potential for}} errors on a scale not previously possible. In this paper, we focus on the strengths and limitations of avian surveillance radars that use marine radar front-ends integrated with <b>digital</b> <b>radar</b> <b>processors</b> to provide 360 ° of coverage. Modern <b>digital</b> <b>radar</b> <b>processors</b> automatically extract target information, including such various target attributes as location, speed, heading, intensity, and radar cross-section (size) as functions of time. Such data can be stored indefinitely, providing a rich resource for ornithologists and wildlife managers. Interpreting these attributes in view of the sensor’s characteristics from which they are generated is the key to correctly deriving and exploiting application-specific information about birds and bats. We also discuss (1) weather radars and air-traffic control surveillance radars {{that could be used to}} monitor birds on larger, coarser spatial scales; (2) other nonsurveillance radar configurations, such as vertically scanning radars used for vertical profiling of birds along a particular corridor; and (3) Doppler, single-target tracking radars used for extracting radial velocity and wing-beat frequency information from individual birds for species identification purposes...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a performance-based {{technique}} to help synthesize high-bandwidth <b>radar</b> <b>processors</b> on commodity platforms. This problem is innately complex, {{for a number of}} reasons. Contemporary radars are very compute-intensive: they have high pulse rates, and they sample a large amount of range readings at each pulse. Indeed, modern <b>radar</b> <b>processors</b> can require CPU loads of in high-gigaflop to tera-flop ranges, performance which is only achieved by exploiting the radar's inherent data parallelism. Next-generation radars are slated to operate on scalable clusters of commodity systems. Throughput is only one problem. Since radars are usually embedded within larger realtime applications, they also must adhere to latency (or deadline) constraints. Building an embedded <b>radar</b> <b>processor</b> on a network of workstations (or a NOW) involves partitioning load in a balanced fashion, accounting for stochastic effects injected on all software-based systems, synthesizing runtime parameters for [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An {{architecture}} for a Direct RF-digitization Type <b>Digital</b> Mode <b>RADAR</b> {{was developed}} at GSFC in 2008. Two variations of a basic architecture were developed {{for use on}} RADAR imaging missions using aircraft and spacecraft. Both systems can operate with a pulse repetition rate up to 10 MHz with 8 received RF samples per pulse repetition interval, or at up to 19 kHz with 4 K received RF samples per pulse repetition interval. The first design describes a computer architecture for a Continuous Mode RADAR transceiver with a real-time signal processing and display architecture. The architecture can operate at a high pulse repetition rate without interruption for an infinite amount of time. The second design describes a smaller and less costly burst mode RADAR that can transceive high pulse repetition rate RF signals without interruption for up to 37 seconds. The burst-mode RADAR was designed to operate on an off-line signal processing paradigm. The temporal distribution of RF samples acquired and reported to the <b>RADAR</b> <b>processor</b> remains uniform and free of distortion in both proposed architectures. The majority of the RADAR's electronics is implemented in digital CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor), and analog circuits are restricted to signal amplification operations and analog to digital conversion. An implementation of the proposed systems will create a 1 -GHz, Direct RF-digitization Type, L-Band <b>Digital</b> <b>RADAR</b> [...] the highest band achievable for Nyquist Rate, Direct RF-digitization Systems that do not implement an electronic IF downsample stage (after the receiver signal amplification stage), using commercially available off-the-shelf integrated circuits...|$|R

40|$|Monopulse <b>radar</b> <b>processors</b> {{are used}} to track targets that appear in the look {{direction}} beamwidth. The target tracking information (range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle) are affected when manmade high power interference (jamming) is introduced to the <b>radar</b> <b>processor</b> through the <b>radar</b> antenna main lobe (main lobe interference) or antenna side lobe (side lobe interference).

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>radar</b> systems {{now have}} {{capabilities}} {{far beyond that}} of their predecessors. Digital systems now offer thunderstorm tracking surveillance. This provides users {{with the ability to}} acquire detailed information of each storm cloud being tracked. Thunderstorms are first identified by matching precipitation raw data received from the radar pulse to some sort of template preprogrammed into the system. In order for a thunderstorm to be identified, it has to meet strict definitions of intensity and shape that set it apart from any non-convective cloud. Usually, it must show signs of organization in the horizontal and continuity in the vertical: a core or a more intense center to be identified and tracked by <b>digital</b> <b>radar</b> tracking systems. Once the thunderstorm cell is identified, speed, distance covered, direction, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) are all tracked and recorded to be utilized later.|$|R
