2500|$|On December 1, 2006, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan {{submitted}} {{a report to}} the Security Council president maintaining [...] "there were no serious incidents or confrontations" [...] since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel [...] "almost on a daily basis", which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon. In one case, a UNIFIL <b>demining</b> <b>team</b> was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with AK-47 rifles. UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day. There were also [...] "13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in Rachaiya El-Foukhar, and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of Bourhoz. Annan also reported that as of November 20, 2006, 822 cluster bomb strike sites had been recorded, with 60,000 cluster bomblets having been cleared by the UN Mine Action Coordination Center.|$|E
50|$|CSHD {{has set up}} a Landmine Relief Fund {{to support}} the {{demining}} process. The main aim of the Fund is to seek contributions from external organizations to finance the cost required to maintain the <b>demining</b> <b>team.</b> It costs approximately $9,000USD per month to maintain a <b>demining</b> <b>team</b> in the field, with the deminers paid up to $250USD per month. In 2011, CSHD had only 1 <b>demining</b> <b>team,</b> comprising 18 deminers working in the field and 7 support staff. It has been a continuing challenge for CSHD to raise funds.|$|E

50|$|Since early 2016, HeroRATs {{have been}} {{deployed}} with CMAC <b>demining</b> <b>teams</b> on operations in minefield for further trials. The trials are aimed at measuring {{factors such as the}} speed in which the MDR are able to search the ground and assisting APOPO and the local mine action authorities to develop specific Standard Operation Procedures for the mine detection work in Cambodia.|$|R
50|$|Zimbabwe is a {{signatory}} of the Ottawa Convention and, by January 2015, must {{produce a}} detailed plan {{of how it}} will achieve its Convention undertakings. It is therefore imperative that both survey and clearance operations start as soon as possible. Survey teams will refine {{the information on the}} extent of the problem while <b>demining</b> <b>teams</b> will start addressing areas of the highest humanitarian priority. Sufficient information exists for <b>demining</b> <b>teams</b> to be able to deploy immediately. HALO has been given initial responsibility for survey and clearance of the border minefields running from Musengeli in Mashonaland Central to Rwenya in Northern Manicaland, some 139 square kilometres in total. Zimbabwe is one of the worldâ€™s most highly mine impacted countries {{in the world and the}} time and resources required to deal with it will be correspondingly large. It will be possible to make more accurate estimations of time and cost once the next phase of survey has been completed and some clearance has been undertaken to establish mine density and corresponding clearance rates.|$|R
50|$|Blast {{waves are}} {{generated}} in research environments using explosive or compressed-gas driven shock tubes {{in an effort}} to replicate the environment of a military conflict to better understand the physics of blasts and injuries that may result, and to develop better protection against blast exposure. Blast waves are directed against structures (such as vehicles), materials, and biological specimens or surrogates. High-speed pressure sensors and/or high speed cameras are often used to quantify the response to blast exposure. Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs or test dummies) initially developed for the automotive industry are being used, sometimes with added instrumentation, to estimate the human response to blast events. For examples, personnel in vehicles and personnel on <b>demining</b> <b>teams</b> have been simulated using these ATDs.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of landmines poses a considerable risk to indigenous populations {{in areas of}} past conflict all around the world. While the number of mines in existence is subject to question, the role of such mines in creating high levels of injury and death is well documented. Most methods of location for such mines {{include the use of}} a metal probe to search the ground ahead of the <b>Demining</b> <b>team,</b> and then removing the soil from over the mine, prior to its neutralization. These steps are dangerous and mine sweeping is a slow and laborious task, as the probes are inserted at roughly 5 -cm intervals manually, in order to sense for the smallest of the antipersonnel mines. It is shown that a pulse of high-pressure water can penetrate to depths of over 30 -cm into the ground, and that the sound made by the jet in striking any target material along that path changing with the target. Based on this it is possible to build a remotely operated discriminator which can, through an array of such [...] ...|$|E
25|$|Along the China-Vietnam border are {{numerous}} minefields. These are {{the legacy of}} border clashes in the 1980s. The mines are mainly anti-personnel, and have kept large areas of arable land from use by local farmers. A typical demining process deployed by the Chinese is as follows. Firebreaks are dug around the minefield to be cleared. Then engineers would set the minefield on fire with flamethrowers. Key factors of this burning process are: thick vegetation covering the minefields; most anti-personnel mines are buried {{very close to the}} ground level; the mines are made of mostly either wood, thin metal or plastic. This burning process would usually destroy about 90% of the mines, as the mines are either detonated or melted. Mines which have trip wires would have these wires burned off. <b>Demining</b> <b>teams</b> then would plow the area with mine detectors. When the teams have cleared the mines, they would walk over the field hand in hand themselves to show to the locals that all the mines have been cleared.|$|R
40|$|Human-robot teamwork, multi-agent systems, {{cooperative}} workflows, knowledge-based systems, <b>demining</b> <b>Teams</b> {{of humans}} and robots pose a new challenge to teamwork. This {{stems from the fact}} that robots and humans have significantly different perceptual, reasoning, communication and actuation capabilities. This paper contributes to solving this problem by proposing a knowledge-based multi-agent system to support design and execution of stereotyped (i. e. recurring) human-robot teamwork. The cooperative workflow formalism has been selected to specify team plans, and adapted to allow activities to share structured data, in a frequent basis, while executing. This novel functionality enables tightly coupled interactions among team members. Rather than focusing on automatic teamwork planning, this paper proposes a complementary and intuitive knowledge-based solution for fast deployment and adaptation of small scale human-robot teams. In addition, the system has been designed in order to provide (humans with) information about the mission status, contributing this way to the human overall mission awareness problem. A set of empirical results obtained from simulated and real missions demonstrates the capabilities of the system. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the activities of}} the <b>Demining</b> Technologies (DeTec) <b>team</b> from the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL), and personnel of Brooks Enterprises International, Inc., Huntsville, Al, USA, while testing the prototype DeTec- 2 Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) in Cambodia. The team, under the direction of Prof. J. D. Nicoud, tested the prototype radar from 18 - 21 November 1997 in the village of Thmar Pouk, near the Thai border. A test minefield had been prepared by personnel from Hazardous Areas Life-support Organization (HALO Trust). The minefield represented several different soil types and contained hundreds of false targets and a few selected antipersonnel (AP) mines which had been deactivated. A significant amount of useful GPR data was collected and is currently being processed. A description of current demining operations is presented, describing the incredibly tedious prodding method, and we propose guidelines for the use of GPR in the field. Lessons learned, [...] ...|$|R
