30|$|The binding {{capabilities}} of cys-anxA 5 constructs were analysed via competition measurements between active anxA 5 -DTPA 6 and anxA 5 -FITC, inactive M 123 -anxA 5 -DTPA and anxA 5 -FITC {{as well as}} wildtype anxA 5 and anxA 5 -FITC for binding to apoptotic Jurkat T cells. The <b>dose–response</b> <b>graph</b> summarising three independent experiments (Figure 1) shows that active anxA 5 -DTPA 6 can effectively inhibit anxA 5 -FITC, with an IC 50 of 6.2 nM (95 % confidence interval 4.8 to 8.1 nM, R 2 = 0.97), whereas wildtype anxA 5 displaces anxA 5 -FITC with an IC 50 of 5.3 nM (95 % confidence interval 3.3 to 8.7 nM, R 2 = 0.95). These results indicate that active anxA 5 -DTPA 6 has a similar affinity as wildtype anxA 5. The inactive M 1234 -anxA 5 -DTPA {{was not able to}} inhibit anxA 5 -FITC binding to apoptotic Jurkat cells, as expected.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if platelet reactivity is altered {{in the first}} trimester of pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: 10 healthy pregnant volunteers were recruited at time of first trimester screening (between 11 - 13 weeks gestation). Controls included 10 age-matched healthy subjects with prior good obstetric outcome. A 30 ml blood sample was taken and platelet function assessed using a novel assay of platelet reactivity. Platelet aggregation to multiple concentrations of Arachidonic Acid (AA), Collagen (Col),Epinephrine (Epi) and Adenosine-Diphosphate (ADP) were measured simultaneously over successive time-points using a modification of light transmission aggregometry. <b>Dose–response</b> curves were <b>graphed</b> with the maximum aggregatory response calculated to multiple doses of each agonist. RESULTS: The pregnant group were significantly less reactive to all submaximal doses of Epi: 1...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In current practice, {{patients}} {{scheduled for}} radiotherapy are treated according to 'rigid' protocols with predefined dose prescriptions {{that do not}} consider risk-taking preferences of individuals. The therapeutic operating characteristic (TOC) graph is applied as a decision-aid to assess the trade-off between treatment benefit and morbidity to facilitate dose prescription customisation. METHODS: Historical dose-response data from prostate cancer patient cohorts treated with 3 D-conformal radiotherapy is used to construct TOC graphs. Next, intensity-modulated (IMRT) plans are generated by optimisation based on dosimetric criteria and <b>dose-response</b> relationships. TOC <b>graphs</b> are constructed for dose-scaling of the optimised IMRT plan and individualised dose prescription. The area under the TOC curve (AUC) is estimated to measure the therapeutic power of these plans. RESULTS: On a continuous scale, the TOC graph directly visualises treatment benefit and morbidity risk of physicians' or patients' choices for dose (de-) escalation. The trade-off between these probabilities facilitates the selection of an individualised dose prescription. TOC graphs show broader therapeutic window and higher AUCs with increasing target dose heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The TOC graph gives patients and physicians access to a decision-aid and read-out of the trade-off between treatment benefit and morbidity risks for individualised dose prescription customisation over a continuous range of dose levels...|$|R
