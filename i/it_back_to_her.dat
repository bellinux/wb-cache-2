5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
5|$|Miceli {{wrestled}} {{a six-week}} tour for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling {{at the beginning}} of 1989, where she won the IWA Women's title from Chigusa Nagayo before dropping <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the very next day. She then began training in Japan, learning the Japanese wrestling style, as well as Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing. She eventually signed a three-year deal with All Japan, which made her the first non-Japanese wrestler to do so. In addition, she worked for the TWA, feuding with Luna Vachon, whom she faced in a Hair vs Hair Mixed Tag Team match in September 1991. Miceli and her partner Eddie Gilbert defeated Vachon and Cactus Jack, which resulted in Vachon having her head shaved.|$|E
5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} closely fought until MSJ pulled {{away in the}} closing minutes. With the Lions having the ball with 30 seconds to play and a safe 9-point lead, Benjamin called a timeout and sent Hill back into the game. They ran another play for Hill, this time for a {{right-handed}} layup, but she missed. One of her teammates rebounded the ball and passed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for a second right-handed layup, which she made to close out the scoring in the Lions' 66–55 win. After the game, MSJ announced that $40,000 had been raised for TCSN.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public explanation on the program. Rumours in magazines and newspapers suggested she had been caught stealing items from other members. Six years later in 2006, Barry appeared on the program Where Are They Now?, {{to speak for the}} first time over the incident. She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance with the intention of giving <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> but forgot to do this and was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep quiet on the matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "But I hope to be, one day." [...] She spoke without thinking, {{not quite}} knowing what she meant. But <b>it</b> came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in after years.|$|R

500|$|Montgomery {{went on to}} {{say that}} the video is full of [...] "temptation, love and lust," [...] and [...] "about {{distance}} and the effect it has on all those things." [...] He goes on to say that in the video [...] "All Ush wants to do is make <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> to do all those things that husbands and wives tend to do. The only problem is he can't." [...] At the end of the video, Lenoir has enough, and walks out. Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite." [...] In resolving the video's review, Montgomery said, [...] "Distance may make the heart grow fonder, but there are limits to everything. Usher may want to be no place but home, but there's a big, wide world out there with pitfalls aplenty. He's a superstar, a businessman, a father and an (ex-) husband, but at the end of the day, Ush is also human, and [...] "Hey Daddy" [...] is proof of that." [...] In a review of the video, Rap-Up said that [...] "Even though it’s been a minute since his last video, the ladies man still knows how to bust a move." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Chris MacNeil gives Father Dyer Father Karras' medal, {{he gives}} <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and says [...] "I {{think you should}} keep it", as {{depicted}} in the novel and instead of simply keeping it as in the original version.

2500|$|The {{professional}} wrestler Warrior (born James Hellwig) legally {{changed his}} name to the mononym [...] "Warrior" [...] in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the World Wrestling Federation. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. Chyna did likewise when the now-WWE attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.|$|E
2500|$|Private Norman Demuth, who {{had been}} {{discharged}} from the British Army after being wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after returning from the Western Front, and decided that if the women that handed them out {{were going to be}} rude to him, {{he was going to be}} rude back. One of the last feathers he received was presented to him whilst he was travelling on a bus, by a lady who was sat opposite him. She handed over the feather and said, [...] "Here's a gift for a brave soldier." [...] Demuth replied, [...] "Thank you very much - I wanted one of those." [...] He then used the feather to clean out his pipe, handed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and remarked, [...] "You know we didn't get these in the trenches." [...] The other passengers subsequently became angry with the woman and started shouting at her, much to Demuth's amusement.|$|E
2500|$|The two briefly become {{best friends}} while he suffers a {{concussion}} in [...] "The Injury". In the season 6 episode [...] "The Delivery", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he {{is sent to}} the Halperts' house to retrieve Pam's iPod, while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering mold. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during [...] "Viewing Party", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in [...] "Doomsday". At this point, Pam is {{the only one in the}} office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.|$|E

25|$|Dwijendranath {{edited the}} {{magazine}} for seven years. Thereafter for eleven years, Swarnakumari took charge as editor and {{worked hard to}} enhance {{the uniqueness of the}} journal.

Rabindranath was only sixteen years old when Bharati was first published. He started contributing to the magazine from the first issue. Indeed, the demands of the magazine enforced certain regularity in Rabindranath’s writing and over the years he contributed enormously to it.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} her outraged {{feelings}} were forgotten. The man had fascinated <b>her.</b> <b>To</b> be told, in this authoritative manner, {{that she was}} wicked was a new and delightful experience. <b>It</b> brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the real motive of her visit, which had in reality been inspired {{not only by the}} sermon of the day before, but by sheer curiosity.|$|R
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} from Korean into English by Deborah Smith, a British translator, {{who has been}} translating Korean into English since 2010. She {{is the founder of}} Tilted Axis Press, a non-profit publishing house focusing on contemporary fiction specifically from Asia. Speaking at the Seoul International Book Fair on 15 June 2016, Smith said that a translator [...] "must be unfaithful to some aspects in order to be faithful to others. I try to stay faithful to the spirit, and faithful to the letter as much as I can, without compromising the spirit." [...] Talking about the process, Kang said, [...] "Deborah usually sends me the file of her translation after she finishes, with notes and questions. And I send <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with my answers and notes. It is just like having a chat endlessly. I truly enjoy this process. I am lucky to have met Deborah, a wonderful translator who can render subtlety and delicacy." [...] Smith has said that her first attempt at Korean translation involved [...] "looking up practically every other word in the dictionary". Smith has translated some of Kang's other works, including Human Acts (2016) and The White Book (2017).|$|E

But no one saw her, the hall being vacant, and she {{breathed a sigh of relief}} as she locked her own door against possible intruders.|$|R
60|$|She had as yet no {{distinct}} {{interest of}} her own, and Bathurst's earnestness had struck a cord {{in her own}} nature and seemed to open a wide area for thought.
