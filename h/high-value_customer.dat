Three strategies are proposed and examined to improve the operation efficiency of a ticket-booking system. Their objective is to assist high-value customers in obtaining the tickets they want and/or reduce cancellations and failure-to-pays from low-value customers. Our simulation results demonstrate that the high-value, customer-friendly strategy beats all in assisting high-value customers and simultaneously improves railway operation performance. Additionally, the indirect, low-value customer abandonment strategy also has improved slightly in all aspects. Applying these strategies is expected to result in a decrease in complaints regarding booking system rejections and an increase in <b>high-value</b> <b>customer</b> satisfaction. On the other hand, the direct abandonment strategy to reject all low-value customers does not make any improvement...|$|E

Unfortunately, our knowledge is limited on long-term marketing effectiveness in this space and on how it differs across customer segments. Managers appear overwhelmed by the combination of rich online data on hundreds of thousands of customers and the typical aggregate-level data on offline marketing spending. This paper is the first to investigate the long-term impact of coupon promotions, TV, radio, print, and Internet advertising across customer segments for a major digital music provider with over 500, 000 customers. We first segment customers and subsequently analyze how these segments respond in the long run to different marketing activities when purchasing music downloads. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of marketing differs across segments, while standard segmentation approaches fail to identify the most valuable catches in a sea of consumers. In contrast to empirical generalizations on consumer packaged goods, heavy users of digital music products are least sensitive to price and most sensitive to TV advertising and to multiple touch points. Light users, the majority of consumers, are price sensitive and tend to opt out of targeted communication. Our research enables managers in the digital media space to target <b>high-value</b> <b>customer</b> segments with the most effective actions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} dynamic pricing with endogenous customer behavior. In the model, there is a monopolist who sells a finite inventory over a finite time horizon. The seller adjusts prices dynamically {{in order to maximize}} revenue. Customers arrive continually over the duration of the selling season. At each point in time, customers may purchase the product at current prices, remain in the market at a cost in order to purchase later, or exit, and they wish to maximize individual utility. The customer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions: they may have different valuations for the product and different degrees of patience (waiting costs). We study this continuous-time game between the seller and the customers, show that it can be reduced into a single-variable nonlinear program, and characterize the equilibrium that maximizes revenue for the seller. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in both valuation and patience is important because they jointly determine the structure of optimal pricing policies. In particular, when <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> are proportionately less patient, markdown pricing policies are effective because the <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> would still buy early at high prices while the low-value customers are willing to wait (i. e. they are not lost). On the other hand, when the <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> are more patient than the low-value customers, prices should increase over time in order to discourage inefficient waiting. Our results also shed light on how the composition of the customer population affects optimal revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare.

40|$|We {{show that}} prices and {{incentives}} {{recommended by the}} salesforce literature when targeting a profitable segment can attract unprofitable customers, particularly when salespeople have high productivity and low risk (i. e., risk aversion times uncertainty). Therefore, when customers are unidentifiable, unprofitable customers may also enter the market creating an adverse selection problem for the salespeople. By solving the moral hazard and adverse selection problems simultaneously, we show that firms can prevent the entry of unprofitable customers by 9 ̆ 3 screening 9 ̆ 4. Although, screening generally requires a higher price to dissuade unprofitable customers, when firms hire salespeople, however, it requires lowering of both selling effort and the price. It also leads to a 9 ̆ 3 sales trap 9 ̆ 4 restricting the sales to the profitable segment to a fixed level. Screening, therefore, lowers firm profits obtained from the profitable customers.

40|$|Consider a {{firm that}} sells {{products}} over repeated seasons, each of which includes a full-price period and a markdown period. The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates {{the existence of a}} monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one. consumer behavior, pricing and revenue management, dynamic programming...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{the interaction between}} revenue management and customer relationship management for a firm that operates in a customer retention situation but faces limited capacity. We present a dynamic programming model for how the firm balances investments in customer acquisition and retention, as well as retention across multiple customer types. We characterize the optimal policy and discuss how the policy changes depending on capacity limitations. We then contrast the modeling results with those of a behavioral experiment in which subjects acted as managers making acquisition and retention decisions. In the modeling part of the paper, we introduce a concept {{of the value of}} an incremental customer (VIC), and show that when capacity is unlimited, VIC equals customer lifetime value (CLV), but when capacity is limited, VIC is much smaller and changes dynamically depending on the number of customers and their mix. As a result, the optimal spending is constant and depends on CLV for the firms with unlimited capacity, but changes dynamically and is generally unrelated to CLV when capacity is limited. In the experimental part, we introduce a concept of conditional optimality for the analysis of state-dependent decisions. Applying this concept to our data, we document a number of decision biases, specifically the subjects' tendency to overspend on retaining <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> and underspend on lower-value customers retention and acquisition.

40|$|In retail management, {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} and critical decisions for managers is how to motivate, staff, and organize their sales force. This task becomes more challenging when employees work in teams so that their productivity will be influenced by peers. Recent work empirically demonstrates peer effects in single-firm work settings under one compensation structure, but these studies leave important questions unanswered. We use a three-year dataset of Chinese cosmetic sales transactions to examine how compensation and firm boundaries influence worker productivity spillovers and sales strategies. We demonstrate three important new sets of findings. First, while high-ability workers under the team-based compensation system significantly improve the sales productivity of their peers, under individual-based compensation they have a strong negative effect on peers while gaining little in the process. Second, we find that peer effects exist across firm boundaries, with workers at team-based compensation counters more capable in competing against peers at other counters. Third, when faced with high-ability peers, workers under individual-based compensation respond by strategically discounting prices offered to customers and focusing on retaining <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> who may be more brand loyal. Our results suggest that while heterogeneity in worker productivity enhances total team performance under team-based compensation, it impacts firms with individual-based compensation negatively. This paper provides a unique contribution to the literature by being the first to simultaneously estimate peer productivity spillovers both within and across firms under multiple compensation systems. It is also the first identifying how workers respond to peer effects with discretionary strategies, and provides important implications for managerial decisions on staffing, compensation, and pricing discretion.

In particular, the potential of Eco-efficient PSS to promote more sustainable industrial practices, such as re-use and re-manufacturing, has been discussed outlining the possible environmental advantages deriving from a more intense use of resources and emphasizing the economic benefits for producers as well. In recent years, together with barriers hindering the implementation of such strategies, authors started discussing also some ‘rebound effects’ that could limit the expected re-manufacturing environmental benefits, such as the obsolescence of re-manufactured products, especially in case of fast technology cycles. To overcome these criticalities and to target <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> segment, the concept of product upgrade in re-manufacturing has been introduced. Upgrade cycles would allow embedding technological innovation into products, to reach advanced environmental performances over time and to satisfy evolving customers’ preferences. However, the concept of product re-manufacturing with upgrade has been treated mainly theoretically with limited evidence of industrial applications in PSS. Producers currently engaged in established remanufacturing practices are mainly big manufacturers of durable or long life-time products, in particular in the B 2 B sector, while only few pioneering cases of PSS offering product upgrade are cited in literature, mainly referring to B 2 C. To contribute to {{the progress of the}} state of the art and to move from theory to industrial application, this article takes a business model perspective for the implementation of remanufacturing with upgrade PSS. A coherent configuration value proposition, supply chain and reverse logistics, revenue model and ownership scheme is proposed, aiming at addressing the major criticalities and barriers encountered in the literature for the implementation of remanufacturing strategies. The producer will play a central role in the business model, since he has the knowledge and capability to conceive product's design and supply chains suited to perform remanufacturing and upgrade cycles. Potential benefits, and unsolved barriers to the implementation of the proposed business model are finally introduced in order to suggest future research directions...|$|R
40|$|Firms are {{interested}} in identifying customers who generate the highest revenues. Typically, customers are regarded as isolated individuals whose buying behavior depends solely on their own characteristics (e. g., previous purchase behavior, demographics etc.). In a social network setting, however, customer interactions {{can play an important}} role in purchase behavior. This thesis develops a generalizable methodology to identify <b>high-value</b> <b>customers</b> in a network. Previous work on social networks has focused most attention on modeling the interaction between individuals and understanding the positions of individuals in a network (e. g., measuring the influence of an individual based on his/her degree of network centrality). Little is known about how network influence directly translates into the benefits to the firm. In this study, the importance of taking into account both an individual characteristics and network effects when measuring customer value is argued. Drawing upon the spatial statistics literature, a spatial autocorrelation model is constructed that explicitly shows how these effects interact in generating firm revenue. This model is applied to a unique user-level dataset from a popular online gaming company in Korea. The data contain information about demographics of individual gamer, interaction between gamers, behavior within the game environment, and revenues generated by each individual. First, we propose a static model studying gamers 2 ̆ 7 revenue in one period. We quantify the relative impact of an individual characteristics and network effects on revenue. The proposed static model shows better forecasts of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s value within a network for the firm than the benchmark models. The empirical analysis shows that individuals who are most influential in a network sense are not necessarily individuals who have the highest customer value. Next, we incorporate the spatio-temporal aspects of social influence in a network into the static model. This model is extended to construct the spatial dynamic model to forecast revenue in a social network. Second, we account for the homophily effects by separating the contemporaneous network effects out into the contemporaneous, temporal, and spatio-temporal effects. The proposed spatial dynamic model allows us to quantify an individual value in a network in a long-term perspective. The dynamic model is shown to outperform the static, and the other benchmark models in quantifying an individual value in revenue generation to the firm. Lastly, a dynamic coevolution model to account for homophily is suggested and discussed for future research...|$|R
