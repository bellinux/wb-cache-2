25|$|In California and Geneva (Switzerland), ravens {{have been}} {{witnessed}} taking walnuts into their beaks, flying up to 60 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in the air, and dropping {{them to the}} ground to crack the shells and eat the nut inside.|$|E
25|$|The central shrine: In the centre, {{under the}} dome, {{is a very}} {{beautiful}} shrine for the idol, who is sitting serenely at a height of ten <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> under a fine baldachino of white inlaid marble. If the whole could be transported to Italy, and a statue of the Virgin substituted for the idol, its beauty would be raved about. A sparrow was perched familiarly on the shrine, and gave us some little friendly chirps to show he did not object to our presence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on the upper}} {{surfaces}} of the leaves on rutaceous plants at ten <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the ground. [...] The newly laid egg is spherical and light green but darkens over time to orange yellow.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} folded {{himself up}} another <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> until his knees {{were higher than}} his head, and lit a cigarette.|$|R
50|$|This statue is hung only a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> off of {{the ground}} - enough to see its shadow, but not so high that it seems about to fall down.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Mr.--Mr. Lee--listen to me, will you?" [...] {{burst out}} Neale. [...] "It's all {{here in my}} notes. You've hurried over the line and you just slipped up a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in your {{observations}} of that section." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{last major}} Cascade Mountain to be conquered by Rusk {{that he wrote}} about was Mount Shasta. He and four members from the Cascadians made an attempt to climb the peak in 1922. The four from the Cascadians were Wayne and Fern Richardson, Clarence Truitt, and Rolfe Whitnall. They nearly {{made it to the}} summit, but were balked by sheets of ice in the last hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The next year Rusk made a solo ascent and this time he was successful. Rusk closed his Tales by stating [...] "y third of a century of {{mountaineering}} was more than rounded out, and, if this should be my last journey to the ice-bound heights, I could not complain." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Devol {{applied for}} the first {{robotics}} patents in 1954 (granted in 1961). [...] The first company to produce a robot was Unimation, founded by Devol and Joseph F. Engelberger in 1956. Unimation robots were also called programmable transfer machines since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart. They used hydraulic actuators and were programmed in joint coordinates, i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation. [...] They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later). [...] Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN, manufacturing Unimates in Japan and England respectively. [...] For some time Unimation's only competitor was Cincinnati Milacron Inc. of Ohio. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.|$|E
60|$|Harry led {{him forward}} where the boat's sheer was higher {{and he could}} stand a couple of <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the water.|$|E
60|$|In another instant {{we were at}} {{the edge}} of the cliff, and a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below us was spread the dense, impenetrable blanket of mist. I stopped and hesitated, for the next step might be my last.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] he whispered. [...] "Jove, he's gone a {{long way}} with it, too!" [...] he muttered, looking upward. [...] "Another <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and he would have been outside. I wonder the place didn't collapse." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door {{suddenly}} quite wide, but he made no motion to depart. On the contrary two men, who must have been standing within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of it, stepped quickly in. Phineas Duge closed the door.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen was}} a little out-house, not unlike a {{gigantic}} dog-kennel, separated by a space of six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the principal dwelling.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, {{a hundred}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away, {{she saw a}} patch of violently {{disturbed}} snow--snow stained a dreadful colour, a snow of scarlet crystals! Three strides and Trafford was in sight.|$|E
60|$|After {{crawling}} {{for forty}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> over this caked mud, Smith suddenly {{found himself on}} a rising stair. Then he understood the plan; the tomb itself was on a higher level.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it IS strange," [...] remarked {{the small}} {{voice of the}} kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away {{from the edge of}} the roof.|$|R
60|$|The indefatigable {{stage manager}} ran {{in and out}} among us while we sang, driving this couple back a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> this other forward, herding this group closer together, {{throughout}} another making space, suggesting {{the idea of a}} sheep-dog at work.|$|R
6000|$|... "A <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of steel," [...] Rotherby explained, {{and struck}} the hilt of his sword. [...] "I might pick a quarrel with him. 'Twould not be difficult. Come upon him unawares, say, and strike him. That should force a fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Arrived at the Shubak al-Nabi, Hamid {{took his}} stand about six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{out of reach}} of the railing, and at that respectful {{distance}} from, and facing[FN#33] the Hazirah (or presence), ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course not}} quite so tall as yourself, say six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> with a slight, {{feminine}} beard--no? you shake your head; well, smooth-faced and rosy, immense breadth of shoulders--ah! I have often pictured to myself that sister of yours--" ...|$|E
60|$|He had again {{approached}} to within three <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> {{and again the}} playful steed had protruded its nose and even touched his hand, but before that hand could grasp the halter, tail and heels were in the air, and away it went a second time.|$|E
6000|$|... "You missed me twice," [...] {{he began}} coolly, {{shifting}} both pistols to one hand. [...] "The last time within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By every rule of single combat your life belongs to me. That {{does not mean}} that I want to take it now." ...|$|R
60|$|The big {{weighing}} machines {{had been}} pushed into corners, and all round the sloping walls swords, cullivers and muskets were piled in orderly array, also a row of iron boxes standing a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart from one another and away from any other objects in the room.|$|R
50|$|A {{cruising}} chute {{is a form}} of {{asymmetric spinnaker}} used by cruising yachts and designed for easy use when short handed. Two sheets are used, with the tack line eased by a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before gybing. Alternatively only one sheet is used, with the sail snuffed before a gybe.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] he {{said with}} a moan. [...] "Each step now is {{carrying}} us lower. I remember hearing some of the old hands say the abandoned drifts were a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> farther down the hill. We must be considerably below the deepest shaft." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bensington evidently {{enjoyed his}} line of high {{intellectual}} detachment. [...] "The thing that interests me most, Redwood, of all this, is to think that his brain {{at the top of}} him will also, so far as my reasoning goes, be five-and-thirty <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above our level.... What's the matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{smallest}} of the pines rose two hundred feet above her; and they ran up until they dwindled to insignificance far aloft {{at the foot of}} a great scarp of rock that rose beyond them for a thousand <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and then gave place in turn to climbing fields of snow.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{heart and}} lungs! I never {{see such a}} boy," [...] so I present Carshot's refrain; and {{even when he was}} within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the customer's face the disciplined ear of Kipps would still at times develop a featureless, {{intercalary}} murmur into--well, [...] "my heart and lungs!" ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "Flooded Ten-year-old Jimmy Rodriguez was able to do what many motorists at NW 31 and Portland weren't Saturday evening - cross the {{intersection}}. Rians left the intersection under a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of water, and road-blocks were set up to keep motorists out. ...|$|R
50|$|Near Fleming Point, {{south of}} Point Richmond, {{the waters of}} the bay have cut low cliffs in which even alternations of {{sandstone}} and shale are observable. In some instances the black shale shows a decided lenticular character. Some lenses are fifteen to twenty feet long and a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> thick in the central part.|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord Julian {{realized}} the position. He released his hilt, {{and a couple of}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of steel slid softly back into the scabbard. But Don Miguel smiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, and held out his hand.|$|E
60|$|At a {{distance}} of some five {{hundred yards from the}} river's bank rose a sheer precipice of granite, two hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in height, which had no doubt once formed the bank itself -- the intermediate space of land now utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining, and deepening and embanking the stream.|$|E
6000|$|As we {{drew near}} the town of Kirkcudbright, which lies very low {{at the mouth of the}} river Dee, I made out a group of men and women on the wharves. The captain was silent, {{regarding}} them. When we had got within twenty <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the landing, a dame in a red woollen kerchief called out: ...|$|E
6000|$|And then, finding {{he could}} not {{possibly}} intercept her, he hurled his mallet {{with all his might}} and main, and out it shot in a gracious curve within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of Master Skelmersdale's head and through the glass lantern of the conservatory. Smash! The new conservatory! The Vicar's wife's beautiful new conservatory! ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} built in 1850, when the Great Western Railway built a new line from its original Oxford station at Grandpont to Rugby. [...] The {{north side of the}} bridge was on the island which was then called Osney. A second bridge {{was built in}} 1887 within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the first bridge.|$|R
60|$|In an instant, however, {{he was up}} and at me again. Again our swords clashed--but once only. It {{was time}} to finish. With a {{vigorous}} disengagement I got past his feeble guard and sent my blade into him full {{in the middle of}} his chest and out again at his back until a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of glittering steel protruded.|$|R
