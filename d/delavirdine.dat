50|$|Although <b>delavirdine</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997, its efficacy is lower than other NNRTIs, especially efavirenz, and it also has an inconvenient schedule.

50|$|As most NNRTIs bind {{within the}} same pocket, viral strains which are {{resistant}} to efavirenz are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, nevirapine and <b>delavirdine.</b> The most common mutation observed after efavirenz treatment is K103N, which is also observed with other NNRTIs. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and efavirenz have different binding targets, so cross-resistance is unlikely; {{the same is true}} with regard to efavirenz and protease inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|After the {{discovery}} of HEPT and TIBO, compounds screening methods were used to develop BI-RG-587, the first NNRTI commonly known as nevirapine. Like HEPT and TIBO, nevirapine blocked viral RT activity by non-competitive inhibition (with respect to dNTP binding). This reinforced {{the idea that the}} new class of anti-HIV inhibitors was inhibiting the activity of RT but not at the active site. Several molecular families of NNRTIs have emerged following screening and evolution of many molecules. Three NNRTI compounds of the first generation have been approved by the FDA for treating HIV-1 infection. Nevirapine was approved in 1996, <b>delavirdine</b> in 1997 and efavirenz in 1998 (table 1). Two of these drugs, nevirapine and efavirenz, are cornerstones of first line HAART while <b>delavirdine</b> is hardly used nowadays. The structure of these three drugs show the wide array of rings, substituents, and bonds that allow activity against HIV-1 RT. This diversity demonstrates why so many non-nucleosides have been synthesised but doesn't explain why only three drugs have reached the market. The main problem has been the potency of these compounds to develop resistance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Delavirdine</b> is a nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor with in vitro activity against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) that is currently being evaluated in combination regimens with various nucleoside analogs, including didanosine. Due to the pH-dependent solubility of <b>delavirdine,</b> the buffering agents in didanosine formulations may reduce <b>delavirdine</b> absorption. To evaluate the potential interaction between these agents, 12 HIV-infected patients (mean [+/- standard deviation] CD 4 + cell count, 304 +/- 213 /mm 3) were enrolled in a three-way crossover single-dose study.

The hallmark of NNRTI {{has been based on}} their ability to interact with a specific site ('pocket') of HIV- 1 RT. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in addition to HIV- 1, different strains of HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (mac 251, agm 3 and mndGB 1) are sensitive to a selection of NNRTI i. e. <b>delavirdine,</b> the HEPT derivative I-EBU (MKC- 442), 8 -chloro-TIBO (tivirapine), alpha-APA (loviride), nevirapine and the pyridinone derivative L- 697, 661. METHODS AND RESULTS: The NNRTI tested inhibited the replication of the different strains of HIV- 2 and SIV at micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the NNRTI on HIV- 2 -induced cytopathicity correlated well with their inhibitory effects on HIV- 2 RT activity. Drug-resistant HIV- 2 (EHO) variants containing the Ser 102 Leu and/or Glu 219 Asp mutations in their RT were selected after passaging the virus in MT- 4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of <b>delavirdine.</b> The EHO virus mutants were at least 20 -fold less susceptible to the antiviral effects of <b>delavirdine.</b> Some cross-resistance, depending on the mutant strain, was observed with the other NNRTI tested (i. e. MKC- 442, tivirapine, loviride and pyridinone L- 697, 661). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NNRTI are not exclusively specific for HIV- 1 but are also inhibitory to different HIV- 2 and SIV strains. These observations will have important implications for the development of new NNRTI with higher activity against both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2.
