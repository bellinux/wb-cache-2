50|$|Acquiring this asset {{may also}} affect the adult <b>dependent</b> <b>child’s</b> {{eligibility}} for provincial assistance programs. A Henson trust {{may be useful}} for enabling the adult <b>dependent</b> <b>child</b> to receive RRSP rollovers and still be eligible for provincial social assistance programs such as Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). A Lifetime Benefit Trust (LBT) is a new option that may be valuable for leaving a personal trust in a will for a special needs, financially <b>dependent</b> <b>child,</b> grandchild or spouse.

5|$|Other {{accomplishments of}} Willis's {{administration}} included eliminating tolls on {{twelve of the}} state's thirteen major bridges and expanding programs for <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and the elderly. Construction of five state tuberculosis hospitalsat London, Madisonville, Paris, Ashland, and Glasgowwas initiated and nearly 80 percent completed {{by the end of}} his term. Republicans were unable to capitalize on Willis's accomplishments as governor, however. In the 1947 gubernatorial election, the party fragmented over their choice of gubernatorial nominee, and Democrat Earle C. Clements was elected governor.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. This is also the fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. The other half is listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights {{to the story of}} her life. She said that she would accept on {{condition}} that the money was enough to balance Michigan's state deficit, $900,000,000 at that time. No film rights were obtained. Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to Families with <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> (AFDC). She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook {{has a low}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 7.2% of all households. This {{is one of the}} lowest figures in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 31.1% of households have <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Windy Nook into halves and lists the eastern half in the top 20% of all deprived areas in England in 2011. The western half is not considered deprived.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Low Fell has a {{population}} of 8,643. 51% of the population are female, slightly below the national average, whilst 49% are male. Only 1% of the population are from a Black or other Minority Ethnic Group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Of the BME group in the settlement, 40% are from the Asian or AsianBritish ethnic group. Low Fell has a very low proportion of lone parent households at some 4% of all households in the settlement. This is the lowest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and compares very favourably with a Borough average of 11.5% and a national average of 9.5%. Some 26% of households have <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead.

Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds.
