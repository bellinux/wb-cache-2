5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E

40|$|In {{order for}} the EU to achieve its goal of 10 % biofuel for all EU motor {{vehicles}} by 2020, {{a substantial amount of}} biofuel as well as a biofuel feedstock would need to be imported largely from developing countries where the climate is warm and labor is inexpensive. But there may never be sufficient supply to fulfill the evergrowing demand for biofuel for road transportation in the EU, even as motor vehicles are increasingly becoming more fuel-efficient.

40|$|Employing {{information}} {{on more than}} 1200 individuals from the Family Survey Dutch Population 2000, we study to what extent risk behaviour (smoking, alcohol use, and unhealthy eating habits) is transmitted intergenerationally from parents to their adult children. Moreover, by building on theoretical notions on the socialization of risk behavior, we derive expectations on differential effects of parental risk behaviour for daughters and sons, and for low and high educated children. Our results show that risk behaviour of parents indeed has a stimulating effect on the smoking, drinking, and eating habits of their offspring. The transmission of abstinence and <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> <b>of</b> mothers is stronger for daughters, whereas the transmission <b>of</b> <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fathers is stronger for sons. Furthermore, higher educated children {{are less likely to}} be a smoker when they have a moderately smoking mother, and alcohol abstinence of the father leads to a lower risk <b>of</b> <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> among higher educated children...|$|R

5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E

5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E.

Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|From the {{founding}} of modern Singapore in 1819 until 1826, Singapore was headed by two Residents in succession. Following Singapore's amalgamation into the Straits Settlements in 1826, it was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council. An Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor but wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, appointed by the Governor {{on the recommendation of}} the Leader of the House. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965. The PAP has been returned to power in every general election and has thus formed the Cabinet since 1959. The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country's economy and largely free from political corruption. On the other hand, it has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, violating freedom of speech and its <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the death penalty (by hanging) for non-violent crimes.|$|E

30|$|The apparel {{industry}} {{continues to}} remain {{as one of the}} greatest polluters and the second largest consumer of water usage in the world (Sahni 2016). This industry consisting of fibers to production to the end consumers brings about serious social, economic, and environmental concerns, because <b>of</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> natural resources, chemical usage to make fabrics, and trends in fast fashion that promote consumers’ compulsive purchasing behavior. Environmentally sustainable or “green” purchasing decisions in everyday consumer behavior, therefore, offer a chance to reduce negative environmental impacts by substituting higher-impact products (e.g., air fresheners, cosmetics, plastic bags) with products that are more eco- friendly. As consumers become more aware of consumption-related environmental problems, they simultaneously grow more cautions when purchasing products and eventually seek to purchase eco-friendly products for the betterment of current and future generations (Kilbourne and Pickett 2008; Laroche et al. 2001). Consistent with these phenomena, in the apparel industry, consumers’ awareness and demands for green apparel have gradually increased.|$|R
40|$|Oyster & Bear is {{comprised}} of both short traditional lyric poems, influenced by the Persian form known as the ghazal, and long conceptual prose-lyrics constrained by <b>excessive</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> singular parts of speech (for example, prepositions or conjunctions) or other units of the English language (i. e., prefixes).

What other images appear when one faces grief alone? What comes in to take the other’s place? In many of the poems or poem sequences, the speaker’s perspective shifts from preoccupation with the Other towards the strange, mythical, and, at times, delusional. Moving past the familiar “life is absurd,” and “loss is difficult,” Oyster & Bear rejects defeatism to ask what lies at the centre of our language and explores what it could be if it isn’t, as some famously suggest, lack...|$|R
25|$|Nitrate {{can also}} enter the {{groundwater}} via <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fertilizers, including manure spreading. This is because {{only a fraction}} of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of nitrate leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing groundwater pollution. The <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of vermicompost and chemical fertilizers on growth characteristics, yield and yield components of marshmallow (Altheaeofficinalis L.), a field experiment was conducted as factorial layout based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during growing season of 2012. Experimental treatments were designed based on 3 levels of vermicompost (0, 5 and 10 t ha- 1) and 5 levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of 200 kg N ha- 1). Results indicated that applied vermicompost had significant effects on increasing leaf area, flower weight per plant and grain yield of marshmallow.
