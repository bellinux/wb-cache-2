She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but {{now that you mention}} it, I think I'll have a nice one." [...] Lowndes suggested that the response merely be [...] "You, too." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Let the Right One In took place, Cloverfield {{director}} Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films. Hammer Films acquired the rights at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature", and Overture films planned to release the film in 2010. Alfredson has expressed unhappiness {{about the idea of}} a remake, saying that [...] "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, that gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong" [...] and expressing concern that the end result would be too mainstream. Alfredson was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> stories that I want to tell." [...] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes referred to the project as a remake of the film and later not as a remake, but just as [...] "Reeves' version". Let Me In was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but under-performed at the box office.|$|E
500|$|The {{rights for}} the English-language film were later {{acquired}} by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," [...] and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director. John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The representatives on mission {{were angry}} at Hoche and {{threatened}} to denounce him. He sarcastically told them to write an order declaring victory, then he went on, [...] "Do not disturb yourselves, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> means". Fortunately for him, Hoche remained in favor with the Committee of Public Safety and was not arrested and executed like Custine and Houchard. Maximilien Robespierre declared that Hoche's behavior showed {{that he was a}} true sans-culotte and another 10,000 reinforcements were sent him from the Army of the Ardennes. However, Hédouville who Hoche had kept as chief of staff for the battle was arrested as a nobleman. François Joseph Lefebvre was promoted to general of brigade for excellent work, as was Édouard Huet for repelling the Prussian assault at Bitche. Louis Huet had shown himself incompetent and was shelved.|$|E
2500|$|Bourguiba was {{satisfied}} with his journey to Kef: [...] "My journey in Kef cured my health. But {{it was too late}} for my physical development. My height did not grow from 1m 65, which meant 5 centimeters less from normal. Because in my teenage years, I lacked vitamins now available to young people and granted to them free of charge in hospitals and by national organizations", he stated years later. While he was in Kef, the Destour party was founded aiming independence. Since then, Bourguiba showed interest in activism and declared to one of his friends in Kef, Othman Kaak: [...] "You love literature. I, myself, like it, I even love it. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> goals. I want to enroll in law school to fight against France". His goals were, however, thwarted by his non-studious educations, unlike his old mates of Sadiki, who became bureaucrats in the colonial administration.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nay, I {{can take}} little credit for that,' our new {{acquaintance}} answered. 'Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> scores to settle with Colonel Kirke's horse, and was but too {{glad to have}} this breather with them.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; {{but because}} they are {{weaknesses}} <b>I</b> don't <b>have.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>others,</b> but not those, and it is sweet to me to know that you are weak in some matters in which I am strong. It makes me feel that I can be of use to you." ...|$|R
