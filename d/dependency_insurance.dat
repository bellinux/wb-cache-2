40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the system of}} {{long-term}} care insurance currently in place in Belgium or rather in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of the country), since the French and German-speaking parts have not yet such insurance. More precisely, we review the scope, benefits, financing and functioning of the Flemish <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance</b> (called the Vlaamse Zorgverzekering) and present some statistics regarding the number of persons affiliated to the Vlaamse Zorgverzekering, the number and percentage of approved applications, the grants awarded by the Government of Flanders and the revenue and expenditure/costs relating to the Flemish <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance</b> system in order to comprehend the key factors explaining some evolution related to the dependency in Belgium. Analyses show that the adjustments and successive changes that the <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance</b> has undergone are explained by its success in terms of claims for benefits. We also find {{that the problem of}} equity and adverse selection favorable to the inhabitants of Brussels {{at the expense of the}} Flemish people is reduced owing to the different treatments for the two regions. ...|$|E
30|$|A {{special case}} {{in terms of}} public 11 health {{insurance}} is <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance.</b> Very few countries have set up such a public system at the national level. In the EU, the pioneers in this field have been Austria (since 1993), Germany (since 1995) and Luxembourg (since 1999). Most ages are covered in these systems. In each case, an assessment of individual needs for long-term care is first conducted, either by a multidisciplinary evaluation unit or a physician, and provision of care is planned either in cash or in services on the basis of limitations in the activities of daily living. For the population covered by the programme, <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance</b> systems can provide (as in Luxembourg) the causes of dependency according to age, sex and residence, among others. They can also show the costs of care (including informal care) and the type of services dispensed.|$|E

40|$|Population {{aging and}} {{changing}} family patterns have made elder care an important issue. In 1994, German law-makers enacted a major {{reform in the}} country' s long-term care policy, the <b>Dependency</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act (DIA). How, and in what way, will the relative use of formal and informal long-term care services change in response? We address this question using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) to examine the mix of care providers used by older Germans prior to enactment. We find that formal care {{is more likely to}} be used by those in the poorest health, the single, or the childless. The presence of daughters increases both the use of family and formal care sources. Future work with more recent waves of the GSOEP is needed to see if family care provision is sustained in an environment of universal public long-term care insurance. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the problem of}} {{population}} ageing in terms of non-medical care needs of persons who are dependent or have lost their autonomy, {{in order to provide}} the various public and private administrations active in these fields with some food for thought. The anticipated increase in dependency poses significant challenges in terms of needs evolution and financing. Using administrative data on the Belgian population to build indicators on the prevalence of dependency at home in the three regions in 2001, we find that the likelihood of a sustained increase in the Flemish prevalence rates ultimately amplifies the magnitude of the financing problems that the Flemish <b>dependency</b> <b>insurance</b> scheme has experienced since its first years of operation. Results also show that the smaller increases or the decreases (according to the scenario selected) expected in Wallonia and Brussels are likely to mitigate concern about the sustainability of any long-term care insurance in Wallonia and therefore to facilitate its eventual introduction. ...|$|E
40|$|Missouri law {{provides}} {{an array of}} mandated coverage and required offers of coverage that do not clearly state public policy objectives in health plans.

30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the rising exploitation rates is that social <b>insurance</b> <b>dependency</b> is “contagious”, e.g., because it becomes less stigmatizing to be a benefit recipient when recipiency is already widespread. This may be the source of what Lindbeck (1995) labeled “hazardous welfare-state dynamics”, whereby initially exogenous changes in exploitation rates are amplified over time through a social multiplier. Despite methodological difficulties, there is now convincing evidence that such multiplier effects are empirically important (Bertrand et al. 2000; Ichino and Maggi, 2000; Aizer and Currie, 2004; Hesselius et al. 2009; Åslund and Fredriksson, 2009; Rege et al. 2012; Markussen and Røed, 2012). This implies that the threat-related favorable effect of activation {{is not limited to the}} reduced recipiency rates among the directly affected individuals – it also includes the knock-on effects on their peers.|$|R

One of the key data mining techniques is decision trees, also referred to as classification and regression trees or CART (Breiman et al, 1993).

The organization also states that despite the monitoring of the FBI, police and other agencies, they were still developing clandestine forces. On September 23, 2007, the EPB offered a message where it expressed {{that the only way}} to [...] "develop the economy of Puerto Rico to its full potential", guarantee [...] "secure and well paid jobs" [...] for the working class and an [...] "education system that really produces educated people" [...] was to take control away from the United States, citing a moral debt to Ojeda Ríos. The organization criticized the health system's <b>dependency</b> on <b>insurance</b> companies and the idea that the United States would unilaterally grant independence, arguing that operating in a frame that fell outside their comfort zone was the path to follow. The EPB then claimed that a series of robberies and attacks against independentist figures including Rafael Cancel Miranda were attempts to intimidate the movement by [...] "those that control the system". The organization also distanced themselves from a man that called the police superintendent, airport and the mail offices and self-identified as a Machetero, citing that they are a [...] "revolutionary organization and not terrorists like the FBI", citing that that [...] "attempts to discredit [...] would not result in desperate actions" [...] and that they would continue with the usual methodical approach. The EPB also expresses it support for worker's unions and opposed the privatization of places of sociocultural interest and recreation, watersources and beaches, as well as deforestation and expropriation.

50|$|In a 2006 article {{published}} in Health Affairs , Robinson describes {{the landscape of the}} commercial insurance market and some of its potential barriers to growth and sustainability due to increasing external pressure. Some of these barriers to growth include its high <b>dependency</b> on employer-based <b>insurance,</b> inability to use pricing power due to cash rich non-profit Blues plans and the market trend towards consumer driven health benefit designs (also known as high deductible health plans) which transfer risk and reward between the consumer and the plan. What is equally concerning is that during the years 2001 through 2010, the rate of employment-based insurance coverage decreased due to rising health care costs placed on plans and employers. With an inability to strengthen their foothold in the now-decreasing employer based market, Robinson suggests that the commercial insurances’ will use historical trends, perspective and economic principles of healthcare finance to overcome these challenges and sustain their growth in earnings. He also predicts the future earnings and profitability of the commercial health insurance industry to be dependent on their ability to anticipate and work through the political agenda and fiscal policies at both the state and federal levels.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} {{in the use of}} copulas has introduced implementation issues for both practitioners and researchers. One of the issues is to obtain a copula function for a given set of data. The most common approaches for the estimation of the parameters of the copula functions have been the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the Inference Functions for Margins (IFM) methods. Archimedean copulas {{are one of the most}} important classes of copulas that are widely used in both finance and insurance for modelling dependent risks. However, simulating multivariate Archimedean copulas has always been a difficult task as the number of dimensions increases. The assessment of capital requirements has always been an important application of stochastic modelling. Capital requirements can vary significantly depending on the model adopted. Several professional bodies have recently discussed the concept of <b>dependencies</b> between <b>insurance</b> risks. They suggest that insurers should use a technique based on copulas to describe the dependence of risks within an insurance company in the context of solvency assessment. The first contribution of this thesis is to provide an insight into the efficiency of parameter estimation methods. This thesis uses numerical experiments to assess the performance of the two common approaches. The second contribution of this thesis is to present a new algorithm to simulate multivariate Exchangeable Archimedean copulas. This algorithm provides a practical solution for simulating one-parameter multivariate Archimedean copulas. Numerical experiments are used to apply this algorithm to determine the "additional" economic capital for an insurance company with multiple lines of business that wants to expand its business by adding another line of business and where the businesses are dependent. The third contribution of this thesis is to quantify the impact of the choice of copulas on the solvency measure of a general insurer within a Dynamic Financial Analysis modelling framework. The results of our experiments provide important guidance for the capital assessment for general insurers...|$|R
30|$|Can we be {{sure that}} more {{intensive}} use of graded absence certificates really has a negative causal effect on overall absenteeism? And – perhaps even more important – that it also leads to lower social <b>insurance</b> <b>dependency</b> in the longer run? These questions are addressed by Markussen et al. (2012), who investigate the causal impacts of issuing graded rather than full-time sick leave certificates for workers in Norway who had been temporary disabled for at least 8 weeks. Since the use of graded (as opposed to full-time) absence certificates is anything but randomly assigned, the authors face an obvious endogeneity problem. This is handled by exploiting the variation in grading-propensity across family physicians, generating {{a significant source of}} random-assignment-like (from the employee’s point of view) variation in the probability of being subject to activity requirements during spells of sickness. Based on an instrumental variables model, Markussen et al. (2012) conclude that the use of graded instead of non-graded sickness absence certificates reduces the length of absence spells, and significantly improves the likelihood that the absentees are employed in subsequent years. The effects are large, both from an economic and a clinical perspective. Their most conservative instrumental variables estimates indicate that substituting a graded for a full-time absence certificate reduces the length of the absence spell by as much as 80 – 90 fulltime-equivalent days and also reduces social insurance claims the next two years – in terms of, e.g., new sickness or disability benefits – by around 80 – 85 days. Even more importantly, it raises employment propensity two years after by 16 – 18 percentage points.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of recent {{interest}} in the modeling of insurance risks to incorporate the presence of dependencies, and some early work in the literature has demonstrated that for a typical dependent <b>insurance</b> portfolio, ignoring <b>dependencies</b> can have a direct impact on the tail or extremes of the overall portfolio loss distribution. The tail of the loss distribution is a typical concern to the actuary. To date, in spite of the growing number of papers in the literature on dependence, there is no known published work that provides for an empirical investigation that validates the presence of <b>dependencies</b> in an <b>insurance</b> portfolio. In this paper, we use mixture models, which are commonly applied in the modeling of dependent credit risks, to facilitate in the understanding of claim dependencies. The empirical data used in this paper comes from a portfolio of automobile insurance provided by the General Insurance Association which is an organization of general insurance companies in Singapore. Because of the volume of data from our source, we reasonably selected a portfolio of policies drawn from a randomly selected insurance provider. To measure up the presence of claim dependencies, the most reasonable statistic to use is the relative risk, a measure that is widely popular in medical statistics and is used to gauge how the presence of a particular insurance risk induces another insurance risk to go on claim. Our calibration results indicate some presence of dependencies; relative risk is in the neighborhood of 14 %. To accommodate for the presence of covariates, we also introduce mixture models with covariates as explained in this article. Not surprisingly, because the premium is the actuary’s best guess of the degree of riskiness of an insurance risk, it provides for the single most important factor that influences the presence of claim dependencies.

30|$|A second {{important}} development, {{which is}} of particular relevance for European welfare state economies, relates to the opening up of labor markets to migration. There are now free movements of labor across 32 European countries. Some of these countries differ widely in terms of living standards, wages and prices. According to European law, entitlements to social insurance can be transferred between these countries and made operative {{in the country of}} current employment. This implies that if citizens from, say, low-cost countries like Lithuania and Poland, obtain work in high-cost countries like Norway or Denmark, they are immediately and fully covered the social insurance arrangements in the host country (provided that they “bring with them” an employment history that corresponds to the host country’s eligibility requirements). And if they become benefit claimants later on, these benefits can be exported back to the origin country, where their purchasing power may be much larger than in the host country. In a recent report from the Norwegian “Welfare and migration commission” (NOU, 2011), it is estimated that the purchasing power of a Norwegian benefit payment is raised by 117 % if it is exported to Poland. Given that Norwegian social insurance benefits typically pay at least 66 % of Norwegian earnings, this implies a potential replacement ratio of 144 %. The moral hazard problems associated with this system are rather obvious. There are currently large migration flows from poor low-cost countries to rich high-cost countries in Europe. And existing empirical evidence indicates that the longer-term labor market performance of labor migrants from low-cost to high-cost countries may be poor. Bratsberg et al. (2010 b), for example, study the life-cycle employment patterns of labor migrants to Norway during the early 1970 ’s (from Pakistan, Turkey, India, and Morocco), and find that only 50 % were still in employment in 2000 – compared to 84 % for a native control group. 74 % of those who had left the labor market received a disability pension. A subsequent study (Bratsberg et al. 2011) indicates that the pattern of quickly declining employment rates – and increasing social <b>insurance</b> <b>dependency</b> – is repeated for a number of later immigration waves.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} impact of policy and economic conditions on the current economic crises of crime, substance abuse, and financial exclusion faced domestically and abroad. Although these issues span the income distribution, impoverished regions are disproportionately affected by {{the highest rates of}} risky behaviors such as drug abuse and crime. The ability for public policy makers to affect large populations of at-risk individuals can be difficult; oftentimes, these groups operate outside of the public sphere and large-scale interventions can miss the mark. In my first substantive chapter, I investigate the efficacy of state-wide insurance reform aimed at reducing drug <b>dependency</b> by requiring <b>insurance</b> providers to cover rehabilitation and detoxification. Utilizing state-level panel data in a generalized differences-in-differences framework, I find that states which enact laws expanding insurance coverage are successful at encouraging treatments for some types of conditions but are limited in their ability to reach individuals struggling with opiate addiction and, correspondingly, have little impact on deterring accidental overdose deaths. In my second substantive chapter, I question the assumptions made in previous empirical work regarding the relationship between economic conditions and crime. Existing literature finds that property crime rates are positively correlated with the unemployment rate. In this paper, I investigate whether this relationship is evolving over time and find that the relationship between property crime rates and unemployment has diminished toward zero. Moreover, I find evidence that there is a non-zero relationship between unemployment and violent crimes during certain periods in time. In my last substantive chapter, we develop a theoretical model illustrating the basic trade-offs in the functioning of financial institutions (Village and Savings Loan Associations) designed to provide financial inclusion to under-served populations in developing countries. We develop a theoretical model which suggests that these groups lack a mechanism to ensure equilibrium in the supply and demand for funds. We test the predictions of this model using experimental data from newly formed groups in Uganda and find that groups operate with excess demand for loans but are often able to generate a high return on savings.

40|$|Abstract Climate {{adaptation}} is recognised {{by many of}} the world’s largest businesses as {{a global}} risk and one that requires critical attention. The World Economic Forum’s 2013 Global Risks Perception Survey, identified the ‘failure of climate change adaptation and rising greenhouse gas emissions as among those global risks considered to be the most likely to materialize within a decade’ (p. 16). Yet despite action by many transnationals and international firms, it seems evident that most Australian companies appear to be struggling to move forward in responding to climate change impacts, apparently paralysed by short-term profit-first thinking, uncertain political risks and a corporate culture unused to volatility and disruption. Research approach This project set out to communicate adaptation to climate change to the “big end of town” and to gather soft data, acquire information and present issues back to the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF), the funder of this research. Our approach to the research challenge differed from a traditional technical, analytical or academic method. We used action-learning principles to engage a community in which we, as advisors to corporate Australia and as co-researchers, have social capital and standing. Through trusted information sharing networks, private closed-door meetings and one on one conversation with executives and senior management from over 100 companies we shared ideas, gathered, researched and refined information and tested our findings. Findings Our findings from the boardroom engagement include the following:   	The Australian Government expects the private sector to adapt, yet little or no incentives exist to promote this behaviour. 	Autonomous adaptation as practiced may only benefit the lead actor while creating disbenefit for others (including other corporations, society and the environment). 	Market practices on current paradigms cannot be expected to meet greater societal adaptation needs. 	Further adaptation research is required in some areas to help guide shape and monitor adaptation for the private sector. 	A multiplicity of policy reform may be necessary, but crafting and implementing it is likely to remain beyond the capability of the Australian Public Service (APS) or individual Governments. 	Highly sophisticated mining, gas and some Asian owned technology companies are leading the way with many opportunities missed by Australian companies. 	Adaptation for the corporate sector is a key strategic issue, unlike mitigation and corporate social responsibility (CSR), as it benefits the corporate primarily. 	<b>Insurance</b> <b>dependency</b> may only be a short-term risk transfer mechanism as, in its current paradigm, it can mask risk, create {{a false sense of security}} and may impede adaptation.   Conclusion We hope that this report is of benefit to Australian organisations, policy makers, regulators and to researchers in adaptation science. This project shows that, on a whole, the Australian private sector is giving little consideration about the impacts climate change. This project has identified that considerable research gaps exist, but has also provided direction for organisations and researchers. Individual corporations and private sector peak bodies urgently need to explore the risks and opportunities that climate change and associated responses bring. This is especially so for the ICT, aviation, energy, insurance and finance sectors.
