5000|$|Burning Index - An NFDRS index {{relating}} to the <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> {{at the head of}} the fire, it is an estimate of the potential difficulty of fire control as a function of how fast and how hot a fire could burn. It has been scaled so that the value, divided by 10, predicts the <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> at the head of a fire. For example, an index of 75 would predict a <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> of 7.5 ft. It is a function of the Spread Component and the Energy Release Component and has moderate variability. It is sensitive to fuel models.and can trace seasonal trends reasonably well for models with heavy dead or live components. Because it uses wind and relative humidity, it is also very sensitive to weather observation errors.|$|E

40|$|The shapes ({{luminous}} flame boundaries) {{of round}} luminous nonbuoyant soot-containing hydrocarbon/air laminar jet diffusion flames at microgravity were found from color video images obtained on orbit in the Space Shuttle Columbia. Test conditions included ethylene- and propane-fueled flames burning in still air at an ambient temperature of 300 K ambient pressures of 35 - 130 kPa, initial jet diameters of 1. 6 and 2. 7 mm, and jet exit Reynolds numbers of 45 - 170. Present test times were 100 - 200 s and yielded steady axisymmetric flames that {{were close to}} the laminar smoke point (including flames both emitting and not emitting soot) with luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> of 15 - 63 mm. The present soot-containing flames had larger luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> than earlier ground-based observations having similar burner configurations: 40 % larger than the luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> of soot-containing low gravity flames observed using an aircraft (KC- 135) facility due to reduced effects of accelerative disturbances and unsteadiness; roughly {{twice as large as}} the luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> of soot-containing normal gravity flames due to the absence of effects of buoyant mixing and roughly twice as large as the luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> of soot-free low gravity flames observed using drop tower facilities due to the presence of soot luminosity and possible reduced effects of unsteadiness, Simplified expressions to estimate the luminous flame boundaries of round nonbuoyant laminar jet diffusion flames were obtained from the classical analysis of Spalding; this approach provided successful correlations of flame shapes for both soot-free and soot-containing flames, except when the soot-containing flames were in the opened-tip configuration that is reached at fuel flow rates near and greater than the laminar smoke point fuel flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Effects of flow (hydrodynamic) {{properties}} on {{limiting conditions}} for soot-free laminar non-premixed hydrocarbon/air flames (called laminar soot-point conditions) were studied, emphasizing non-buoyant laminar coflowing jet diffusion flames. Effects of air/fuel-stream velocity ratios were of particular interest; therefore, the experiments {{were carried out}} at reduced pressures to minimize effects of flow acceleration due to the intrusion of buoyancy. Test conditions included reactant temperatures of 300 K; ambient pressures of 3. 7 - 49 8 kPa; methane-, acetylene-, ethylene-, propane-, and methane-fueled flames burning in coflowing air with fuel-port diameters of 1. 7, 3. 2, and 6. 4 mm, fuel jet Reynolds numbers of 18 - 121; air coflow velocities of 0 - 6 m/s; and air/fuel-stream velocity ratios of 0. 003 - 70. Measurements included laminar soot-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths,</b> laminar soot-point fuel flow rates, and laminar liftoff conditions. The measurements show that laminar soot-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> and fuel flow rates can be increased, broadening the range of fuel flow rates where the flames remain soot free, by increasing air/fuel-stream velocity ratios. The mechanism of this effect involves the magnitude and direction of flow velocities relative to the flame sheet where increased air/fuel-stream velocity ratios cause progressive reduction of flame residence times in the fuel-rich soot-formation region. The range of soot-free conditions is limited by both liftoff, particularly at low pressures, and the intrusion of effects of buoyancy on effective air/fuel-stream velocity ratios, particularly at high pressures. Effective correlations of laminar soot- and smoke-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> were also found {{in terms of a}} corrected fuel flow rate parameter, based on simplified analysis of laminar jet diffusion flame structure. The results show that laminar smoke-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> in coflowing air environments are roughly twice as long as soot-free (blue) flames under comparable conditions due to the presence of luminous soot particles under fuel-lean conditions when smoke-point conditions are approached. This is very similar to earlier findings concerning differences between laminar smoke- and sootpoint <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> in still environments...|$|R
30|$|Coast redwood {{also had}} an {{apparent}} mitigating effect on the mortality of nearby associated tree species. This result was somewhat counterintuitive as fire severity (estimated using bole char height) reached maximum heights on coast redwood trees, and although coast redwoods are adapted to withstand extreme <b>flame</b> <b>lengths,</b> many associated species are not. It {{may be that the}} elevated <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> associated with coast redwood were the result of highly concentrated duff (Nives 1989), or dense sprout thickets at the base of coast redwoods, and did not spread to other nearby trees. It should also be noted that, while coast redwood exhibited the highest maximum bole char height, the average bole char height for the species was modest.|$|R

50|$|Generally, fire retardants are {{dropped from}} {{aircraft}} or applied by ground crews around a wildfire's edges {{in an effort}} to contain its spread.

50|$|Weather {{conditions}} and fuel conditions are large {{factors in the}} decisions made on a fire. Within the U.S., the Energy Release Component (ERC) is a scale relating fuel energy potential to area. The Burning Index (BI) relates <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> to fire spread speed and temperature. The Haines Index (HI) tracks stability and humidity of air over a fire. The Keetch-Byram Drought Index relates fuels to how quickly they could ignite and to what percentage they should burn. The Lightning Activity Level (LAL) ranks lightning potential into six classes.|$|E
40|$|The laminar smoke-point {{properties}} of nonbuoyant round laminar jet diffusion flames were studied emphasizing results from long duration (100 - 230 s) experiments at microgravity carried -out on- orbit in the Space Shuttle Columbia. Experimental conditions included ethylene-and propane-fueled flames burning in still air at an ambient temperature of 300 K, initial jet exit diameters of 1. 6 and 2. 7 mm, jet exit velocities of 170 - 1630 mm/s, jet exit Reynolds numbers of 46 - 172, characteristic flame residence times of 40 - 302 ms, and luminous <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> of 15 - 63 mm. The onset of laminar smoke-point conditions involved two flame configurations: closed-tip flames with first soot emissions along the flame axis and open-tip flames with first soot emissions from an annular ring about the flame axis. Open-tip flames were observed at large characteristic flame residence {{times with the}} onset of soot emissions associated with radiative quenching near the flame tip; nevertheless, unified correlations of laminar smoke-point properties were obtained that included both <b>flame</b> configurations. <b>Flame</b> <b>lengths</b> at laminar smoke-point conditions were well-correlated in terms of a corrected fuel flow rate suggested by a simplified analysis of flame shape. The present steady and nonbuoyant flames emitted soot more readily than earlier tests of nonbuoyant flames at microgravity using ground-based facilities and of buoyant flames at normal gravity due to reduced effects of unsteadiness, flame disturbances and buoyant motion. For example, laminar smoke-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> from ground-based microgravity measurements were up to 2. 3 times longer and from buoyant flame measurements were up to 6. 4 times longer than the present measurements at comparable conditions. Finally, present laminar smoke-point <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> were roughly inversely proportional to pressure, which is a somewhat slower variation than observed during earlier tests both at microgravity using ground-based facilities and at normal gravity...|$|R

The larger the pip amount is, the longer the delay will be; but the flame is also longer.

Duplex Burner Architecture won the [...] "New Technology Development of the Year Award" [...] at the 2014 West Coast Oil & Gas Awards. The company's other major product is Electrodynamic Combustion Control, which uses computer-controlled electric fields to control the flame shape in boilers, kilns, and furnaces, preventing pollution from forming.|$|E
50|$|Conceptual {{models from}} {{experience}} and intuition from past fires {{can be used}} to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service, Forestry Canada, Nobel, Bary, and Gill, and Cheney, Gould, and Catchpole for Australasian fuel complexes have been developed for quick estimation of fundamental parameters of interest such as fire spread rate, <b>flame</b> <b>length,</b> and fireline intensity of surface fires at a point for specific fuel complexes, assuming a representative point-location wind and terrain slope. Based on the work by Fons's in 1946, and Emmons in 1963, the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of piles of sticks burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested.|$|E
30|$|Western {{spruce budworm}} {{outbreaks}} {{can have a}} significant impact on certain fire metrics and fuel loading in lower elevation forests. Hummel and Agee (2003) found that surface fuel loading and <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> are greater in stands at the end of a WSBW outbreak than those at the onset in mixed conifer forests. However, no significant differences were found in BA or TPH mortality due to fire from early to late outbreak conditions. This is contrary to our study, which has shown that, in spruce-fir forests, WSBW outbreaks can result in decreased <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> and BA mortality as compared to pre-outbreak conditions under severe fire weather conditions. However, the fire regime and stand structure of spruce-fir forests are characterized by heavy fuel loads and dense stand structures that support high severity stand-replacing fires regardless of WSBW activity.|$|R

The shredded, or masticated, debris forms a compacted layer of woody fuel on the soil surface, resulting in a fuel structure that is thought to alter fire behavior by reducing <b>flame</b> <b>lengths,</b> intensity, and rate of spread (Kane et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|With {{this type}} of firing, {{combustion}} is extremely rapid, and short <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> results. The mixing is so intense that combustion rates exceeding 35,000 Btu/(ft3·h) or 360 kW/m3 are practical under certain conditions. However, since there is considerable impingement of flame over the furnace walls it is absolutely necessary that they be fully water-cooled. This sweeping of the water-cooled surfaces, in the furnace, by the gas increases the evaporation rate. Thus, in addition to absorption by radiation from the flame envelope, there is transfer by convection, and the resulting furnace temperatures are lower than {{with other types of}} burners, even though the heat liberation rates may be somewhat higher. Tangentially fired furnaces are usually clean in the upper zone and, as a result, both the furnace and the boiler are comparatively free from objectionable slag deposits.|$|E
5000|$|Strategies of {{wildfire}} prevention, detection, and suppression {{have varied}} over the years. One common and inexpensive technique is controlled burning: permitting or even igniting smaller fires {{to minimize the}} amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire. Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation. Wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many forests. Fuels may also be removed by logging, but fuels treatments and thinning {{have no effect on}} severe fire behavior. Wildfire itself is reportedly [...] "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, <b>flame</b> <b>length,</b> and heat per unit of area" [...] according to Jan Van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station. Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure.|$|E

The property is divided into burn units with documented fire histories. We collected all data from a 97.1 ha burn unit 61 B, located in {{the south end of}} ABS, just after its most recent fire (22 October 2008). This fire was prescribed and ignited using drip torches, with a combination of backing, flanking, and head fires. Fire weather included a maximum temperature of 29 °C, minimum relative humidity about 45 %, maximum wind speed of about 5 m s− 1, winds from NE to ENE, and clear skies. <b>Flame</b> <b>lengths</b> were not reported.

30|$|From the six fire {{behavior}} outputs available in Behave, we selected heat release, spread rate, and <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> as the parameters most pertinent to our analysis (Albini 1976, Bradshaw et al. 1983, Andrews 1986). Heat release (btu/ft 2), {{an indicator of}} the total potential damage from a fire, varies with fuel model type and fuel moisture, but is independent of slope and wind. Rate of spread (chains/hour, a chain is 66 feet) is affected by fuel model, fuel moisture, slope, and wind. <b>Flame</b> <b>length</b> (ft) is influenced by fuel model, fuel moisture, slope, and wind. <b>Flame</b> <b>length</b> is often used as a general descriptor of fire intensity and difficulty of suppression; e.g., a <b>flame</b> <b>length</b> of four feet is considered the upper limit for hand crews (NWCG 1993). <b>Flame</b> <b>length</b> also is one determinant (along with crown base height and sub-canopy ladder fuels) of whether a fire will spread from surface fuels into the canopy.|$|E
30|$|We {{considered}} this multistep approach to generate specific fire simulation inputs appropriate because it incorporated all available data {{and because of}} commonalities in the derivation of BI and the fire behavior outputs calculated in the present study.

Fire behavior simulations showed that shrublands had the greatest <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> under low wind conditions, and that pinyon-juniper woodlands had the greatest <b>flame</b> <b>lengths</b> when winds exceeded 25 km hr− 1 and fire transitioned to the crowns. Air pollution removal capacity (PM 10, O 3, NO 2, etc.) was significantly greater in pinyon-juniper stands, followed by shrublands and grasslands. Carbon storage (trees and burned tree snags only) did not significantly differ between pinyon-juniper and burned stands (| 14 000 kg ha− 1), but will change as burned snags decompose. Annual C sequestration rates in pinyon-juniper stands averaged 630 kg ha− 1 yr− 1. A landscape-level assessment showed that total compliance with residential defensible space regulations would result in minimal impact to air pollution removal capacity and carbon sequestration due to a currently low population density. Our methodology provides a practical mechanism to assess how potential management options might simultaneously impact both fire behavior and various environmental services provided by WUI vegetation.|$|R
