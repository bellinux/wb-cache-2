50|$|Coralline algae are {{widespread}} {{in all of}} the world's oceans, where they often cover close to 100% of rocky substrata. Only one species, Pneophyllum cetinaensis, is found in freshwater. Many are epiphytic (grow on other algae or marine angiosperms), or <b>epizoic</b> (grow on animals), and some are even parasitic on other corallines. Despite their ubiquity, the coralline algae are poorly known by ecologists, and even by specialist phycologists (people who study algae). For example, a recent book on the seaweeds of Hawaii does not include any crustose coralline algae, even though corallines are quite well studied there and dominate many marine areas.|$|E

Samples were collected at three sites of different degree of water movement in the intertidal zone and sublittoral fringe during 1975 and 1976. From 93, 916 organisms belonging to 172 species, 5, 331 were Crepidula, the most abundant among sessile species. Also, Crepidula constitutes a substratum to attachment of Amphiroa, accounting for 30 % of total phytal area. There was a positive correlation between the growth of shell and <b>epizoic</b> alga. Higher level of the phytal belt was more suitable for attachment and/or growth of the <b>epizoic</b> alga, without influence from water movement or season of the year. This association depends on the external morphology of the shell, filter-feeding habit, high adhesive power and lacking of mechanisms avoiding attachment of epizoics of Crepidula.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a study {{regarding}} the phylogenetic positions of two enigmatic earwig lineages whose unique phenotypic traits evolved in connection with ectoparasitic relationships with mammals. Extant earwigs (Dermaptera) have traditionally been divided into three suborders: the Hemimerina, Arixeniina, and Forficulina. While the Forficulina are typical, well-known, free-living earwigs, the Hemimerina and Arixeniina are unusual <b>epizoic</b> groups living on molossid bats (Arixeniina) or murid rodents (Hemimerina). The monophyly of both <b>epizoic</b> lineages is well established, but {{their relationship to the}} remainder of the Dermaptera is controversial because of their extremely modified morphology with paedomorphic features. We present phylogenetic analyses that include molecular data (18 S and 28 S ribosomal DNA and histone- 3) for both Arixeniina and Hemimerina for the first time. This data set enabled us to apply a rigorous cladistics approach and to test competing hypotheses that were previously scattered in the literature. Our results demonstrate that Arixeniidae and Hemimeridae belong in the dermapteran suborder Neodermaptera, infraorder Epidermaptera, and superfamily Forficuloidea. The results support the sister group relationships of Arixeniidae+Chelisochidae and Hemimeridae+Forficulidae. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and substantial macroevolutionary changes at the morphological level as related to adaptive evolution, in this case linked to the utilization of a novel trophic niche based on an <b>epizoic</b> life strategy. Our results also indicate that the evolutionary consequences of the transition to an ectoparazitic mode of living, which is extremely rar...|$|E

40|$|Sixty {{specimens}} {{of the giant}} marine isopod Glyptonotus antarcticus Eights, collected from Borge Bay, Signy Island, Antarctica were examined for epizoans. Ten species of cheilostomatid bryozoans {{were found on the}} isopods. The {{purpose of the study was}} to quantify the prevalence, intensity, abundance, and spatial distribution of the bryozoans on the isopods. The proportion of isopods colonized was 42 %. The larger isopods had both significantly more <b>epizoic</b> bryozoan colonies and species. The greatest density of bryozoans was on the fused pleon and telson. There was no significant difference between the dorsal and ventral abundance of bryozoan colonies. The diversity of <b>epizoic</b> bryozoans on the isopods is higher than on other host organisms from more stable environments. This may be because of active selection by settling larvae.

The present study {{is the first of}} the <b>epizoic</b> di-atom community covering the olive ridley turtle’s (Lepidochelys olivacea) carapace and the first describing diatoms living on sea turtles in general, with the primary objective of provid-ing detailed information on turtle epibiotic associations. Samples of turtle carapace includ-ing the associated diatom biofilm and <b>epizoic</b> macro-fauna were collected from Ostional beach (9 ° 59 ´ 23. 7 ´ ´ N 85 ° 41 ´ 52. 6 ´ ´ W), Costa Rica, during the arribada event in October 2013. A complex diatom community was present in every sample. In total, 11 macro-faunal and 21 diatom taxa were recorded. Amongst diatoms, the most numerous were erect (Achnanthes spp., Tripterion spp.) and motile (Haslea sp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., Proschkinia sp.) forms, followed by adnate Amphora spp., while the most common macro-faunal species was Stomatolepas elegans (Cirripedia). Diatom densities ranged from 8179 ± 750 to 27685 ± 4885 cells mm- 2. <b>Epizoic</b> microalgae were either partly immersed or entirely encapsulated within an exopolymeric coat. The relatively low diatom species num-ber, stable species composition and low inter-sample dissimilarities (14. 4 % on average) may indicate a mutualistic relationship between the epibiont and the basibiont. Dispersal of sea turtle diatoms is probably highly restricted and similar studies will help to understand both diatom diversity, evolution and biogeography, and sea turtle ecology and foraging strategies...|$|E

40|$|Many {{scleractinian coral}} species host <b>epizoic</b> acoelomorph flatworms, both in {{aquaculture}} and in situ. These symbiotic flatworms may impair coral growth and health through light-shading, mucus removal and disruption of heterotrophic feeding. To quantify {{the effect of}} <b>epizoic</b> flatworms on zooplankton feeding, we conducted video analyses of single polyps of Galaxea fascicularis (Linnaeus 1767) grazing on Artemia nauplii in the presence and absence of symbiotic flatworms. 18 S DNA analysis revealed that flatworms inhabiting G. fascicularis belonged to the genus Waminoa (Convolutidae), which were hosted at a density of 3. 6 ± 0. 4 individuals polyp- 1. Polyps hosting flatworms exhibited prey capture rates of 2. 2 ± 2. 5, 3. 4 ± 4. 5 and 2. 7 ± 3. 4 nauplii polyp- 1 30 min- 1 at prey concentrations of 250, 500 and 1, 000 nauplii L- 1, respectively. Polyps that had their flatworms removed displayed prey capture rates of 2. 7 ± 1. 6, 4. 8 ± 4. 1 and 16. 9 ± 10. 3 nauplii polyp- 1 30 min- 1. Significant main and interactive effects of flatworm presence and ambient prey concentration were found, reflected {{by the fact that}} flatworms significantly impaired host feeding rates at the highest prey density of 1, 000 nauplii L- 1. In addition, flatworms displayed kleptoparasitism, removing between 0. 1 ± 0. 3 and 0. 6 ± 1. 1 nauplii 30 min- 1 from the oral disc of their host, or 5. 3 ± 3. 3 to 50. 0 ± 2. 1 % of prey acquired by the coral.

40|$|Bryozoan skeletons are a {{dominant}} constituent of cool-wa-ter carbonate sediments in the Cenozoic of southern Austra-lia. The primary substrate on {{much of the}} modern continen-tal shelf is loose sediment that is reworked intermittently to 200 m water depth by storm waves. Availability of stable substrate is a limiting factor in the modern distribution of bryozoans in this setting. As a result, a significant propor-tion of the sedimentologically important modern bryozoans (30 – 250 m water depth) live attached to sessile, benthic in-vertebrate hosts that possess organic or spicular skeletons. Hosts such as hydroids, ascidian tunicates, sponges, soft worm tubes, octocorals, and other lightly-calcified and ar-ticulated bryozoans provide ephemeral substrates; after death, host skeletons disarticulate and decay, leaving little or no body fossil record. The calcareous sediments produced by these <b>epizoic</b> bryo-zoans from ephemeral substrates result in loose particles that rarely preserve substratal relationships, but potential-ly retain diagnostic basal attachment morphologies. Al-though the best known examples of <b>epizoic</b> carbonate pro-duction on ephemeral substrates are from the southern Aus-tralian margin, this {{may be an important}} phenomenon both globally and in the fossil record.

Recent analyses of syndermatan phylogeny suggested paraphyly of Eurotatoria (free-living bdelloids and monogononts) {{with respect to}} endoparasitic acanthocephalans. Data of <b>epizoic</b> seisonids, however, were absent, which may have affected the branching order within the syndermatan clade. Moreover, the position of Seisonidea within Syndermata should help in understanding the evolution of acanthocephalan endoparasitism. Here, we report the first phylogenomic analysis that includes all four higher-ranked groups of Syndermata. The analyzed data sets comprise new transcriptome data for Seison spec. (Seisonidea), Brachionus manjavacas (Monogononta), Adineta vaga (Bdelloidea), and Paratenuisentis ambiguus (Acanthocephala).
