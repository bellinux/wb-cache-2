The Old Testament documents the destruction of the Midianites, taking place during the life of Moses in the 2nd millennium BCE. The Book of Numbers chapter 31 recounts that an army of Israelites killed every Midianite man but captured the women and children as plunder. These were later killed at the command of Moses, with the exception of girls who had not slept with a man. The total number killed is not recorded but the number of surviving girls is recorded by the Book of Numbers as 32,000.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gendercide</b> is {{reported}} to be a rising problem in several countries. Census statistics report that in countries such as China and India, the male to female ratio is as high as 120 men for every 100 women. <b>Gendercide</b> also takes the forms of abortion and infanticide, and lethal violence against a particular gender at any stage of life.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} term offered is <b>gendercide</b> {{which is}} more ambiguous and inclusive. However, some feminists argue that the term <b>gendercide</b> perpetrates the taboo of {{the subject of the}} murder of females. Feminists also argue that the motives for femicide are vastly different than those for androcide. Instead of centering in street violence, much of femicide is centered within the home.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gendercide</b> is the {{systematic}} killing {{of members of}} a specific gender. The term {{is related to the}} general concepts of assault and murder against victims due to their gender, with violence against women and men being problems dealt with by human rights efforts.|$|E
5000|$|Androcide is a {{coordinate}} term of femicide and a hyponym of <b>gendercide.</b> The etymological root of {{the hybrid}} word is derived {{from a combination of}} the Greek prefix andro meaning [...] "man" [...] or boy, with the Latin suffix cide, meaning killing.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>gendercide</b> {{was first}} coined by American feminist Mary Anne Warren in her 1985 book, Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection. It refers to gender-selective mass killing. Warren drew [...] "an analogy between {{the concept of}} genocide" [...] and what she called [...] "gendercide". In her book, Warren wrote: ...|$|E
50|$|Examples {{include the}} 1988 Anfal {{campaign}} against Kurdish males that were considered “battle-aged” (or approximately ages 15-50) in Iraqi Kurdistan. While {{many of these}} deaths took place after the Kurdish men were captured and processed at concentration camp, the worst instances of the <b>gendercide</b> happened {{at the end of}} the campaign (August 25-September 6, 1988).|$|E
5000|$|Andrea Dworkin {{criticized the}} {{biological}} determinist strand in radical feminism that, in 1977, she found [...] "with increasing frequency in feminist circles" [...] which echoed {{the views of}} Valerie Solanas that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a <b>gendercide</b> {{to allow for the}} emergence of a [...] "new Übermensch Womon".|$|E
50|$|In a broad conception, nonkilling opposes aggression, assassination, autogenocide, {{contract}} killing, corporate manslaughter, cultural genocide, capital punishment, democide, domestic killings, ethnic cleansing, ethnocide, femicide, feticide, <b>gendercide,</b> genocide, honor killing, ritual killings, infanticide, linguicide, mass murder, murder-suicide, omnicide, policide, politicide, regicide, school shootings, structural violence, suicide, terrorism, thrill killing, tyrannicide, violence, war, {{and other}} forms of killing, direct, indirect or structural.|$|E
50|$|Non-combatant men {{and boys}} have been and {{continue}} to be the most frequent targets of mass killing and genocidal slaughter, as well as a host of lesser atrocities and abuses. <b>Gendercide</b> Watch, an independent human rights group, documents multiple gendercides aimed at males (adult and children): The Anfal Campaign, (Iraqi Kurdistan), 1988 - Armenian Genocide (1915-17) - Rwanda, 1994. Forced conscription can also be considered gender-based violence against men.|$|E

50|$|The People's Republic of China and its {{predecessors}} {{have a history}} of female infanticide spanning 2000 years. Worldwide, the practice of infanticide has been practiced since antiquity for the purpose of population control. It is an unsanctioned method of family planning that has been condoned for centuries in the area until recent times. The phenomenon is also referred to as female gendercide; however, the word <b>gendercide</b> can be used for both sexes.|$|E
50|$|Primarily, {{alternative}} initiatives resolve around {{reform of}} current flawed, failing laws. One proposal {{calls for the}} expansion of the protection for women under the international refugee law in order to provide asylum to victims of gender discrimination or <b>gendercide.</b> One way this could be achieved would be by including women in the definition of a “persecuted social group”, which would allow their gender to seek international asylum under fear of dowry-related persecution globally.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-natal {{diagnostic}} techniques like Medical Ultrasonography {{are capable}} of determining {{the sex of the}} fetus. In many parts of India, daughters are not preferred and hence sex-selective abortion is commonly practised, a form of <b>Gendercide,</b> resulting in an unnatural male to female population sex ratio due to millions of developing girls being terminated before birth. According to The Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques(Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Amendment Act, 2002 the following are cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offences ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} approach to the study of gender and international relations. In 1999, Jones co-founded the Web-based nongovernmental organization <b>Gendercide</b> Watch with Carla Bergman and Nart Villeneuve, aimed at [...] "confronting gender-selective atrocities against men and women worldwide." [...] His essays on gender, violence, and international politics are compiled in Gender Inclusive: Essays on Violence, Men, and Feminist International Relations (Routledge, 2009). An edited volume, The Rape of Males in War and Genocide, is forthcoming with Routledge.|$|E
50|$|As a {{contributing}} measure to gender imbalance in developing countries, Kristof and WuDunn's best {{estimate is that}} a girl in India, from 1 to 5 years of age, dies from discrimination every four minutes (132,000 deaths per year); that 39,000 girls in China die annually, within {{the first year of}} life, because parents did not give girls the same medical care and attention that boys received. The authors describe similar gender discrimination and <b>gendercide</b> in Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, Iraq, Bahrain, Thailand and many other developing countries.|$|E
50|$|Female {{infanticide}} is {{the killing}} of newborn female children, while female selective abortion is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus. <b>Gendercide</b> is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender {{and it is an}} extreme form of gender-based violence. Female infanticide is more common than male infanticide, and is especially prevalent in South Asia, in countries such as China, India and Pakistan. Recent studies suggest that over 90 million girls and women are missing in China and India as a result of infanticide.|$|E
50|$|Rita Banerji, feminist {{author and}} founder of The 50 Million Missing Campaign to end female <b>gendercide</b> in India, has {{said that there are}} also {{millions}} of girls and women killed through various forms of femicides, that extend across various age groups. In a U.N. Symposium on Femicide in Vienna on November 26, 2012, she talked about the six most widespread forms of femicide in India. These included female infanticide, the killing of girls under six years through starvation and violence, the killing of women due to forced abortions, honor killings, dowry murders, and witch lynchings. Many of the femicides in India are perpetrated against girls.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} {{opens in}} India, {{the scene is}} of a woman standing in a field, who is explaining that she had killed eight of her newborns by strangulation as they were female. Davis had initially set out to create a documentary on sex trafficking and on women being exploited. Having listened to the story from the Indian woman, Davis switched direction, scrapping his first idea, and instead created a documentary with the sole focus being <b>gendercide.</b> Davis focused on China and female infanticide in India, as cultural norms, combined with such cultural practices as India's dowry system and China's one-child policy, {{have an important role}} in the practice.|$|E
5000|$|By analogy, <b>gendercide</b> {{would be}} the {{deliberate}} extermination of persons of a particular sex (or gender). Other terms, such as [...] "gynocide" [...] and [...] "femicide," [...] {{have been used to}} refer to the wrongful killing of girls and women. But [...] "gendercide" [...] is a sex-neutral term, in that the victims may be either male or female. There is a need for such a sex-neutral term, since sexually discriminatory killing is just as wrong when the victims happen to be male. The term also calls {{attention to the fact that}} gender roles have often had lethal consequences, and that these are in important respects analogous to the lethal consequences of racial, religious, and class prejudice.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, the pro-Kurdish, feminist Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) was founded. In its program, {{it calls}} itself a [...] "women’s party" [...] and {{promises}} a women’s ministry to address <b>gendercide</b> and institutional gender discrimination. It has {{female and male}} co-chairpersons for all levels of responsible and representative office. The HDP entered the 2015 parliamentary elections with feminist (as well as LGBT) candidates. The success of the HDP in the June 2015 election was hailed as [...] "revolutionary" [...] in the international press, with The Guardian asserting that [...] "until {{the arrival of the}} HDP, {{there has never been a}} party recognising that women have struggled to assert their rights throughout Turkey’s history." ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2006 Banerji started 50 Million Missing, {{an online}} {{advocacy}} campaign {{to raise awareness}} of female <b>gendercide</b> in India. The campaign was launched on Flickr, collecting thousands of photos of Indian girls and women from over 2400 photographers. Since its launch the campaign has grown and spread to other social networking sites and also runs information blogs. It is a zero-fund campaign and runs on community effort and participation. The campaign was a consequence of Banerji’s book Sex and Power. She says, “The data on the systemic and mass-scale violence on Indian women and girls I was gathering for my book was playing out in its stark grotesqueness in my everyday reality. A baby girl is abandoned on the streets in my city, and as residents wait for the police to respond, street dogs kill her and start eating her…I saw the connection {{and for the first time}} felt uneasy, ashamed and outraged." [...] Banerji contends that the three worst disasters that India faces in the 21st-century, are population explosion, an AIDS epidemic, and the female <b>gendercide.</b> These she concludes are a result of India's deeply patriarchal and conservative approach to women and sexual morality, and the [...] "socialized dichotomy" [...] of men from women, and sex from the sacred. In an interview with The Big Issue in the North Banerji says the underlying problem with all three issues is a [...] "virulent patriarchy that is self-indulgent...through practice of multiple partners and irresponsible sex, and it essentially views women as sexual commodities to be used and discarded at will. A woman's only worth is in her production of sons for the continuation of the patriarchy. So daughters are routinely discarded before or soon after birth." ...|$|E
50|$|Oakes {{has written}} two books; Dragon's Eye: A Chinese Noir, {{published}} in 2003, and Citizen One, which {{was released in}} 2007. He is credited with the instigation of the 'Chinese noir' genre, in which the People's Republic of China's politics are viewed {{in the setting of}} a crime-thriller. Both books deal with Human Rights issues in China, in a political/crime thriller setting where alienation and the shadow of the state loom large. Oakes has extensive experience travelling in the People's Republic of China. Dragon's Eye won the Euroropean Crime and Mystery Award in Paris in 2004, and centres upon the controversial organ transplant system within China. Citizen One is a fast moving crime and political thriller which deals with a host of issues including vice, transgenic crops, <b>gendercide</b> and the cult of the 'princeling' children of wealthy cadre in the People's Republic of China.Both of his books have received positive reviews.|$|E
5000|$|Scholars {{of antiquity}} {{differentiate}} between genocide and <b>gendercide,</b> in which males were killed {{but the children}} (particularly the girls) and women were incorporated into the conquering group.

5000|$|Banerji {{has argued}} against {{the view that}} {{education}} and economic development are the solution to India’s female gendercide.She states that an analysis of census data indicates that the gender ratio is most imbalanced in the top 20% {{of the population of}} India by wealth and education and that the ratio is closest to the natural norm in the bottom 20% of the same scale. She asserts that increased access to education, health care, jobs and higher earnings lead to more abortions of unborn female children, drawing a direct correlation between the number of educational degrees a woman has and the likelihood that she will eliminate unborn daughters. Banerji also claims that high-income professional women are also victims of dowry violence and murder in India. Their education and wealth is no protection, because they are unable to fight off the family and cultural pressures on them to remain in the marriage, regardless of the violence they are subjected to. Banerji contends that it is not economics or education, but rather a cultural misogyny that is the prime factor in India’s female <b>gendercide.</b> She says this is most evident in how culture specific crimes like dowry murders and ‘honour' killings hound expatriate Indian women too, and sex-selected abortion is so prevalent, that the Indian communities in certain western countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway too have sex ratios that are abnormally skewed against females. Banerji asserts that <b>gendercide</b> needs to be recognised as a gender based hate crime against women, what Diana Russell has termed as ‘Femicide,’ and be dealt with {{in the same manner as}} other hate crimes based on race, religion or ethnicity.. She explains that this lethal hatred of females is rooted in India’s history, religions and traditions, which over the centuries have created a socially permissive environment for extreme and deadly violence against females. She calls this “the acculturation of female homicide." [...] She says,“terms like sati, bride-burning, dowry death, doodh-peeti, kuri-mar, and jauhar…each a method of female homicide that was still is widely practised, widely accepted, and culturally-specific to India... When a practice acquires a name in a society, it becomes acceptable at the subconscious level of that community's collective thinking. Its premise becomes sacrosanct, and the lines between crime and culture, and what is permissible and reprehensible, become blurred. It is this deep, historically-rooted acculturation of female homicide that is sustaining female genocide in India.” ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Banerji, India has not {{experienced}} a sexual {{revolution in the}} same way as that seen in Europe and North America, which established each woman’s independent and individual rights and choices over her own body and sexuality. She believes it is very important for the women’s movement in India to have such a revolution particularly in context of putting the <b>gendercide</b> in perspective for Indian society. As she points out, this is because, “It is about the recognition of women as individuals with certain fundamental rights, including that of safety and personal choices, which no one, not even the family, can violate… A girl or woman, within the Indian cultural context, is regarded as a family’s property. She does not have the ownership of her own body… And so it is the parents, the husbands, and in-laws who have the prerogative to decide and make the choices regarding a girl or a woman’s being. Whether or not she is allowed to live or after birth…Who she can or cannot marry… Her husband is entitled to sex whether she wants it or not. He decides when and how many children he wants and what sex they should be. He and his family can torture her to extort more dowry wealth, or subjugate her to repeated pregnancies and excruciating abortions to rid female progeny as always is the case with female feticides…is yet another constrictive, dictatorial authority that asserts its power over an individual woman’s being in India - that of culture and society. It decides what constitutes the prototype of a [...] "good Indian woman" [...] - and directs everything from her demeanor and costume, to what her roles and goals in society ought to be..” ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gendercide</b> is a {{term that}} first emerged in a book written by Mary Anne Warren in 1985, {{entitled}} Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection. The term refers to “gender selective mass killing. ” <b>Gendercide,</b> and specifically femicide, is an enormous problem facing the global community of the modern era and has {{claimed the lives of}} over an estimated 100 million women since the 1970 s and 1980 s (Meaney 1). Women killed solely based on gender are victims of rape, domestic violence, and honor killings. Victims also include women that die due to insufficient access to health care, which often tends to favor men. Discussions on <b>gendercide</b> also include the results of the preference to have sons in patriarchal societies. Countries in South and East Asia present the most striking cases of gender disparity in which men, and especially male children, far outnumber women and female children. Further research into these skewed sex ratios has exposed the pervasive influence of son preference in these regions that results in higher mortality for young girls, female infanticide, and female-selective abortion. The gender disparities in China and India have specifically been under scrutiny in the past few decades. Both countries average over 120 males per every 100 female childre...|$|E
40|$|The term <b>gendercide</b> {{was first}} coined in 1985 and {{refers to the}} {{deliberate}} extermination of persons of a particular sex. The notion and its potential consequences had been conceived {{as far back as}} 1793, when the Marquis Nicolas de Condorcet had speculated “what might be [the effect] on humankind [of] the discovery of a means of producing a male or female child according to the will of the parents [ [...] . ]. Supposing that this is likely to become a common practice, [ [...] . ] would it [not] lead to [changes] in the social relations of human beings, whose consequences could be harmful to the peaceable development of that indefinite perfectibility with expectations of which we have flattered humankind?...|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} a diaspora community narrative of rape and abduction suffered during the genocidal massacre of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire and its aftermath. Based on interviews with 50 Aramean, Assyrian and Chaldean migrants in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, whose families are {{from the village of}} Bote, {{known as one of the}} ‘killing fields’ in southeast Turkey, the article explores the ways in which descendants remember the ‘forgotten genocide’ of Aramean, Assyrian and Chaldean communities in 1915. The research reveals that the descendants of survivors make sense of the sexual violence experienced in Bote mainly through a religious narrative and that, for them, the genocide is, in spite of all the sufferings the males had to go through, a feminized event. In their <b>gendercide</b> narrative, the abducted and raped women are identified as the ‘heroines’ of the genocide...|$|E
