2500|$|On one occasion, while escorting two {{merchant}} {{ships to}} Dutch Harbor, Prince David encountered a thickening fog. Captain Godfrey deployed a <b>fog</b> <b>buoy</b> as a precaution. SS Elias Howe, one of Prince Davids charges, immediately sounded an emergency signal of six blasts on her whistle. Thinking {{that it was}} a periscope, she opened fire on the <b>fog</b> <b>buoy</b> streaming from Prince Davids stern. After the event Prince Davids commanding officer' with commendable objectivity, complimented Elias Howe on her [...] "fine degree of alertness".|$|E
5000|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, and fearing their attack posed {{a serious threat}} to the Northwest, a strong American naval force was deployed in Alaskan waters. Some estimates had put the Japanese naval strength at four 6-inch cruisers, eight destroyers and as many as eighteen submarines in the Aleutians. Late August 1942, Prince David, Prince Henry, Prince Robert and the corvettes [...] and , were ordered to co-operate with American forces being transported to Kodiak. Operating under orders of the United States Navy, and designated as Force [...] "D", they escorted convoys between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor (now Unalaska), Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign. Prince David and her sister ships made no actual contact with the enemy during their almost 3-month tour of duty in the northern waters. This was not to say, however, that the work was dull or uneventful. Seamen who were used to the open ocean seldom allow themselves to be impressed by anything the weather and navigational difficulties have to offer; but the men of the 'Prince' ships soon realized that whatever the perils of the North Atlantic, nothing compared with the sudden gales, erratic currents and uncharted shoals of the North Pacific. In 1942, the Canadian ships were equipped with only rudimentary radar which made navigation a source of constant danger. Fog gave way to gales which gave way to fog. Known as the Aleutian [...] "Williwaw", violent winds born in the [...] "storm factory" [...] of the Bering Sea roared down the narrow mountain passes to challenge labouring convoys with little sea room to begin with. Many of the convoy ships, who could not exceed 6 kn, battled a 4 kn current and, when hit with such a gale, often force 10, frequently had to disperse and find shelter as best they could.The 'Princes' themselves were not known for their manoeuvrability; heavy and blocky, when forced to keep pace with a slow convoy and in order to maintain steerage, the ships often ran with the leeward shaft at twice the speed of the other. Despite these extreme conditions, there were surprisingly few mishaps.On one occasion, while escorting two merchant ships to Dutch Harbor, Prince David encountered a thickening fog.

50|$|Wigham {{made many}} other inventions, {{largely in the}} area of {{maritime}} safety. He invented new oil-lamps, gas-lights and electric-lights, gas-powered <b>fog</b> signals, <b>buoys,</b> petroleum-fuelled buoy lights and acetylene lighting equipment. He was working on new electric illumination systems {{at the time of his}} death in 1906. Lights supplied by Edmundson & Co were used in lighthouses all over the globe; the firm still exists today as F. Barrett & Co, of Dublin.|$|R
50|$|A {{contemporary}} public {{sculpture in}} Boston named Harbor <b>Fog,</b> stilled <b>buoys</b> {{dream of a}} lost harbor, is a responsive sensor-activated interactive sculptural environment located along the main pedestrian walkway of Wharf District Park Parcel 17, on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. The first permanent public artwork along the Greenway, the concept was selected through a competition for commission by the Mass Highway Department, and integrated into site construction in collaboration with engineers during building of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig).|$|R
50|$|A {{navigational aid}} (not to be {{confused}} with aid to navigation, ATON, or navaid) is any sort of marker which aids the traveler in navigation; the term is most commonly used to refer to nautical or aviation travel. Common types of such aids include lighthouses, <b>buoys,</b> <b>fog</b> signals, and day beacons.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{boundary}} layer moisture have been acquired from Rotronic MP- 100 sensors deployed on two National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico from June through November 1993. For one sensor that was retrieved approximately 8 months after deployment and a second sensor that was retrieved about 14 months after deployment, the pre- and postcalibrations agreed closely and fell within WMO specifications for accuracy. A second Rotronic sensor {{on one of the}} buoys provided the basis for a detailed comparison of the instruments and showed close agreement. A separate comparison of the Rotronic instrument with an HO- 83 hygrometer at NDBC showed generally close agreement over a 1 -month period, which included a number of <b>fog</b> events. The <b>buoy</b> observations of relative humidity and supporting data from the buoys were used to calculate specific humidity. Specific humidities from the buoys were compared with specific humidities computed from observations obtained from nearby ship reports, and the correlations were generally high (0. 7 â€“ 0. 9). Uncertainties in the calculated values of specific humidity were also estimated and ranged between 0. 27 % and 2. 1 % of the mean value, depending on the method used to estimate this quantity. The time series of specific humidity revealed three primary scales of variability: small scale (of the order of hours), synoptic scale (several days), and seasonal (several months). The synoptic-scale variability was clearl...|$|R
