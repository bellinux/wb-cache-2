The High Roller explains that he and Babydoll are supposed to [...] "screw", but {{that he has no}} intention of simply taking her. Instead, he is looking for a moment of truth in a fake world, which can only be provided by someone who is not a faker, which is why he needs Babydoll - <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to see in her eyes a simple truth: that she would give herself to him willingly, not because she has to, but because she wants to. At first, Babydoll seems reluctant as the High Roller becomes more intimate, but soon starts warming up to him. The High Roller explains that in exchange for this one moment of truth, he will give her absolute freedom, as an abstract ideal. Babydoll willingly pulls him close to her, and they kiss. At this moment, Babydoll's fantasy ends, and she is thrust back into the real world just as the surgeon's needle enters her eye.|$|E

6000|$|We {{descended from}} Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, {{followed}} a hilly, rocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours. All distances in the East are measured by hours, not miles. A good horse will walk three {{miles an hour}} over nearly {{any kind of a}} road; therefore, an hour, here, always stands for three miles. This method of computation is bothersome and annoying; and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan hours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a foreign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to catch the meaning in a moment. Distances traveled by human feet are also estimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the calculation is. In Constantinople you ask, [...] "How far is it to the Consulate?" [...] and they answer, [...] "About ten minutes." [...] "How far is it to the Lloyds' Agency?" [...] "Quarter of an hour." [...] "How far is it to the lower bridge?" [...] "Four minutes."

The same set meet every night at supper: there are seldom any ladies; those who come are chiefly French ladies, members of the corps de ballet. He wins often, but not always. Lord Deuceace is a very fine player. The Chevalier Elliot, the English Minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play.

6000|$|... 16.--We {{have had}} a {{successful}} day. The drive each way was a treat in itself, and the moon rising over the sea on our way home was a sight never to be forgotten. Hollybridge is charming in itself. Those grounds with their sea-board are unique, and I never saw such Spanish chestnuts in England. Then the gardens and the turf! One must have lived as long in foreign parts as we have to appreciate the perfect finish and well-tended look of such places. Your dear old chief does not quite agree. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> space, and is oppressed {{with the sense of}} hedges and fences, except when he looks to the sea, and even there the rocks look polished off, and treated by landscape gardeners! He walked me about to see the show places, and look at the pictures, saying he had been so well lionised that he wanted some one to discharge his information upon. It was great fun to hear him criticising the impossibilities of a battle-piece-- Blenheim, I think--the anachronisms of the firearms and uniforms, and the want of discipline around Marlborough, who would never have won a battle at that rate. You know how his hawk's eye takes note of everything. He looked at Metelill and said, [...] "Uncommonly pretty girl that, and knows it," [...] but when I asked what he thought of Isabel's looks, he said, [...] "Pretty, yes; but are you sure she is quite aboveboard? There's something I don't like about her eyes." [...] I wish he had not said so. I know {{there is a kind of}} unfriendly feeling towards her among some of the girls, especially the Druces and Charley. I have heard Charley openly call her a humbug, but I have thought much of this was dislike to the softer manners, and perhaps jealousy of my notice, and the expression that the old lord noticed is often the consequence of living in an uncongenial home.|$|E
