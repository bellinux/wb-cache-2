40|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} is {{an underlying}} mechanism {{of learning and}} memory in neural systems, but it is controversial whether synaptic efficacy is modulated in a graded or binary manner. It {{has been argued that}} binary synaptic weights would be less susceptible <b>to</b> noise than <b>graded</b> <b>weights,</b> which has impelled some theoretical neuroscientists to shift from the use of <b>graded</b> <b>to</b> binary <b>weights</b> in their models. We compare retrieval performance of models using both binary and graded weight representations through numerical simulations of stochastic attractor networks. We also investigate stochastic attractor models using multiple discrete levels of weight states, and then investigate the optimal threshold for dilution of binary weight representations. Our results show that a binary weight representation is not less susceptible to noise than a graded weight representation in stochastic attractor models, and we find that the load capacities with an increasing number of weight states rapidly reach the load capacity with graded weights. The optimal threshold for dilution of binary weight representations under stochastic conditions occurs when approximately 50 % of the smallest <b>weights</b> are set <b>to</b> zero...|$|R

Longitudinal {{construction was}} used throughout with frames spaced [...] apart and subdivided by twelve transverse compartments. Stress-bearing parts of the hull used 60kg/m² grade steel while the remainder of the hull used 50kg/m² <b>grade</b> steel. <b>To</b> save <b>weight</b> all internal partitions used Duralumin as did the sides of the superstructure. The hull was entirely riveted, but all other joints were welded. Despite these efforts, top-weight was higher than on earlier classes of contre-torpilleurs because of the weight of the twin-gun turrets.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{vehicle bodies}} make {{intensive}} use of {{high strength steel}} <b>grades</b> <b>to</b> improve the <b>weight</b> and the mechanical performance simultaneously. A broad range of medium and extra high strength steel grades is available. These steel grades have different characteristics concerning strength, formability and weldability. For many steel grades microalloying by niobium {{is the key to}} achieve their characteristic property profile. In HSLA steels niobium enhances the strength primarily by grain refinement. In interstitial free high strength steels niobium serves as a stabilizing element and also assists in obtaining the bake hardening effect. Some modern multiphase steels rely on niobium to achieve additional strength via grain refinement and precipitation hardening. Microstructural control provides a way to further optimize properties relevant to automotive processing such as cutting, forming and welding. The relevance of niobium microalloying in that respect will be outlined...|$|R
40|$|The nDCG measure {{has proven}} to be a popular measure of {{retrieval}} effectiveness utilizing graded relevance judgments. However, a number of different instantiations of nDCG exist, depending on the arbitrary definition of the gain and discount functions used (1) to dictate the relative value of documents of different relevance <b>grades</b> and (2) <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> the importance of gain values at different ranks, respectively. In this work we discuss how to empirically derive a gain and discount function that optimizes the efficiency or stability of nDCG. First, we describe a variance decomposition analysis framework and an optimization procedure utilized to find the efficiency- or stability-optimal gain and discount functions. Then we use TREC data sets to compare the optimal gain and discount functions to the ones that have appeared in the IR literature with respect to (a) the efficiency of the evaluation, (b) the induced ranking of systems, and (c) the discriminative power of the resulting nDCG measure...|$|R
40|$|Existing design {{policies}} {{determine the}} speed variation of vehicles on upgrades solely {{as a function}} of specific values: initial speed, <b>grade,</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> power ratio. This paper establishes a dynamic model that considers in addition the influence of the roadway's horizontal alignment. The model was validated on both tangents (using existing speed-distance profiles and similar simulation models) and curves (by an existing simulation model and field measurements). The model output was examined on a roadway alignment. It was found that sharp horizontal curves influence the speed of heavy vehicles significantly on mild upgrades. Therefore the conventional speed profile determination has to be supplemented by incorporating the horizontal alignment as well. The proposed model can be used to provide solutions in a more efficient and realistic way than does the current practice...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{assessed}} {{the use of}} conformation and fatness scores of the EUROP sheep carcass <b>grading</b> system <b>to</b> predict <b>weight</b> and percentage of salable meat from Brazilian market lambs. Data were collected from in vivo, carcass, and retail production from 252 uncastrated lambs. Evaluated models included single regressions, two multivariate models, and one determined by the stepwise procedure. Conformation was moderately correlated with weight of salable meat. Fatness scores were correlated with rump perimeter, carcass width, and thoracic depth with coefficients of − 0. 33, − 0. 32, and − 0. 23, respectively. Body weight was the best single predictor for weight of salable meat and cold carcass yield for percentage of salable meat. All multivariate models for weight of salable meat prediction were significant. Stepwise regression with body weight, leg perimeter, thoracic depth, rump perimeter, and fatness scores predicted 98 % of weight of salable meat variation. For percentage of salable meat prediction, stepwise regression with cold carcass yield, leg perimeter, and conformation score was significant. The EUROP conformation and fatness scores {{can be used in}} Brazil for the prediction of lamb meat production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In bid evaluation, {{the regular}} grade method on the grade items {{is that the}} grade message is {{composed}} of average value after throwing away the highest and lowest value, which essence is considered that the expert’s weight is zeroed. It is pointed the processing is too simple and unable {{to deal with all}} kinds of problems effectively in the match. Basing on numerical statistics, referencing multiple attributes and comprehensive decision theory, a grade method is put forward <b>to</b> empower expert <b>weight.</b> The method according to the results consistence of the expert grade determines the grade weight, then correcting their <b>grade</b> <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> each specific bid, fully using all grade message coming from the bid evaluation team. Its computation is simple and easy to computer processing. So it has larger practical value.

30|$|In this study, an {{automatic}} 6 -year-old ginseng grade classification machine was developed. The developed machine sends the 6 -year-old ginseng classification results to a factory server that stores the daily classification results, monitors the current classification status, and effectively performs production management. The ginseng classification {{is performed using}} image processing {{on the basis of}} criteria such as estimated weight and analyzed shape pattern. The various <b>grades</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>weight</b> of the ginseng are as follows: Grade 3 : 30 – 40  g; Grade 2 : 40 – 75  g; and Grade 1 : 75  g and above. In this paper, the proposed algorithm segmented image sector <b>to</b> estimate the <b>weight</b> of a ginseng and experiments have shown that this method is effective for weight estimation. This image segmentation method is used to recognize the postures and gestures of the hand and body for using computer based vision system [13, 14]. Following the weight-estimation procedure, the group of candidates determined as being in Grade 1 was again evaluated using shape analysis and each candidate assigned a grade between one and three. Evaluations conducted of the performance of the developed machine using 100 units of 6 -year-old ginseng showed that it has a high recognition rate, with an accuracy of 94 % for Grade 1, 98 % for Grade 2, and 90 % for Grade 3.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} work was to study {{the effect of the}} route of anti-IBDV vaccine {{administration}} on elevation of antibody titre and protective efficacy against Gumboro disease in addition the maternally derived antibodies titre (MDA) declining pattern was also studied. For this purpose 125 one day old progeny chicks from a known vaccinated dams were reared at an isolated pens and tested to determine anti IBDV antibody titre at day one (MDA) and day 17. At day 17 birds were divided into 5 groups; A, B, C and D based on the administration route of anti-IBDV vaccine while group E was not vaccinated and acted as negative control. Group A was vaccinated via intranasal (I/N) route. Group B was vaccinated via drinking water (oral) route. Group C was vaccinated via subcutaneous route. Group D was vaccinated via spraying (Inhalation) route. Each group was vaccinated twice at day 17 (Primary) and at day 24 (booster). Fifteen days post booster dose, sera samples were tested and birds were challenged to study the protective efficacy of the vaccine in each group. The mean antibody titre and coefficient of variation of group B were found to be superior to other groups. The protective efficacy parameters including mortality rate, gross lesions <b>grading,</b> bursa <b>to</b> body <b>weight</b> X 10 ratio and histopathologic changes <b>grading</b> were found <b>to</b> be better in group B than in other- 3 groups...|$|R
