50|$|The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> <b>segment</b> of an {{instrument}} approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one Initial approach fix and <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> <b>segment.</b> The initial approach fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The initial approach fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach.

The TAA is {{a transition from}} the en route structure to the terminal environment which provides minimum altitudes for obstacle clearance. The TAA is a [...] "T" [...] or [...] "basic T" [...] design with left and right base leg IAFs on <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> <b>segments</b> perpendicular to the intermediate <b>approach</b> <b>segment</b> {{where there is a}} dual purpose IF/IAF for a straight-in procedure (no procedure turn NoPT), or hold-in-lieu-of procedure-turn (HILO) course reversal. The base leg IAFs is 3 to 6 NM from the IF/IAF. The basic-T is aligned with the runway centerline, with the IF 5 NM from the FAF, and the FAF is 5 NM from the threshold.|$|R

40|$|Satellite based {{augmentation}} systems (SBAS) for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) currently enable precise {{vertical and}} lateral guidance for aircraft {{during the final}} approach. The newly established advanced-Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concept allows all aircraft to follow repeata-ble ground tracks even during curved <b>segments</b> in the <b>approach.</b> This was previously only possible with special aircraft and air-crew authorization. Terminal Area Paths (TAPs) allow the path definition and vertical guidance during the arrival and <b>initial</b> through intermediate <b>approach</b> <b>segment.</b> Here, {{we report on the}} design and flight test results of advanced procedures that employ combinations of the three aforementioned possibilities. We in-clude TAPs, originally a concept from the Ground Based Aug-mentation System (GBAS), into the onboard FMS database in order to use them with an SBAS based navigation solution. The TAPs transition to a localizer performance with vertical guidance final <b>approach</b> <b>segment,</b> thus enabling vertically guided continu-ous descent approaches from cruise level at selectable descent angles down to 200 ft. During the flight trials, an A 320 research aircraft was able to follow the desired trajectory with vertical and lateral total system accuracy of less than 20 meters. Secondly, we show that combinations of advanced RNP with SBAS final <b>approach</b> <b>segments</b> can effectively decouple runways in dense traffic environments where these runways previously were pro-cedurally dependent. Sufficient obstacle clearance can also be achieved despite power lines with a height of ~ 300 ft passing just south of the airport. While performing the flight trials, we rec-orded a lateral precision better than 44. 5 m during a curved missed approach using automatic flight control in a Hawker 750 XP business aircraft...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis extends {{research}} on human visual path integration using optic flow cues. In three experiments, a large-scale path-completion task was contextualised within highly-textured authentic virtual environments. Real-world navigational experience was further simulated, through {{the inclusion of}} a large roundabout on the route. Three semi-surrounding screens provided a wide field of view. Participants were able to perform the task, but directional estimates showed characteristic errors, which can be explained with a model of distance misperception on the outbound roads of the route. Display and route layout parameters had very strong effects on performance. Gender and navigation mode were also influential. Participants consistently underestimated the final turn angle when simulated self-motion was viewed passively, on large projection screens in a driving simulator. Error increased with increasing size of the internal angle, on route layouts based on equilateral or isosceles triangles. A compressed range of responses was found. Higher overall accuracy was observed when a display with smaller desktop computer monitors was used; especially when simulated self-motion was actively controlled with a steering wheel and foot pedals, rather than viewed passively. Patterns and levels of error depended on route layout, which included triangles with non-equivalent lengths of the two outbound roads. A powerful effect on performance was exerted by the length of the "approach segment" on the route: that is, the distance travelled on the first outbound road, combined with the distance travelled between the two outbound roads on the roundabout curve. The final turn angle was generally overestimated on routes with a long <b>approach</b> <b>segment</b> (those with a long first road and a 60 ° or 90 ° internal angle), and underestimated on routes with a short <b>approach</b> <b>segment</b> (those with a short first road or the 120 ° internal angle). Accuracy was higher for active participants on routes with longer <b>approach</b> <b>segments</b> and on 90 ° angle trials, and for passive participants on routes with shorter <b>approach</b> <b>segments</b> and on 120 ° angle trials. Active participants treated all internal angles as 90 ° angles. Participants performed with lower overall accuracy when optic flow information was disrupted, through the intermittent presentation of self-motion on the small-screen display, in a sequence of static snapshots of the route. Performance was particularly impaired on routes with a long <b>approach</b> <b>segment,</b> but quite accurate on those with a short <b>approach</b> <b>segment.</b> Consistent overestimation of the final angle was observed, and error decreased with increasing size of the internal angle. Participants treated all internal angles as 120 ° angles. The level of available visual information did not greatly affect estimates, in general. The degree of curvature on the roundabout mainly influenced estimates by female participants in the Passive condition. Compared with males, females performed less accurately in the driving simulator, and with reduced optic flow cues; but more accurately with the small-screen display on layouts with a short <b>approach</b> <b>segment,</b> and when they had active control of the self-motion. The virtual environments evoked a sense of presence, but this had no effect on task performance, in general. The environments could be used for training navigational skills where high precision is not required...|$|R
