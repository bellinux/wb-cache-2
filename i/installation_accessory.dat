50|$|The nut is stepped and {{the larger}} {{diameter}} end is chamfered around 270 degrees of its diameter. The angled face created is meant to interface with the chamfer on the backside of the KeyMod slot. The full diameter is left intact to create two flats on the nut which align the nut to the slot, {{and allow it to}} be indexed to the accessory {{as well as to the}} KeyMod slot. This eliminates the need to align the nuts to the holes prior to <b>accessory</b> <b>installation</b> as well as the need for tools to tighten the screw/nut. In most accessories, the screw is swaged after assembly to ensure that it cannot be backed out of the nut. This prevents loss of small parts (screws, nuts or other small parts used in the assembly of the accessory). The spacing of the holes is critical and is based on MIL-STD-1913 spacing to allow the greatest modularity with existing accessories.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe quality {{management}} of Prefabricated Vertical Drain (PVD) material installation in ground improvement works in land reclamation projects {{is a critical}} task for designers, contractors and clients alike.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigated}} to what extend risk analyses {{may play}} {{its role in}} the development of feasibility study of Riau regional water supply projects (regional SPAM). This SPAM services coverage area may cover 4 (four) regions in Riau province such as; Rokan Hulu regency, Rokan Hilir, Bengkalis and Dumai. The capacity of this SPAM is 500 l/second. Total financing required for development of this SPAM was approximately Rp. 344 billion. Project finance will be obtained from budget sharing scheme from APBN (Rp. 140 billion or 41 %), APBD (Rp. 62 billion or 18 %), and the private sector (Rp. 141 billion or 41 %). Three stages of risk analyses have been applied in this paper, such as; (i) risk identification, (ii) risk assessment, and (iii) risk mitigation. Based on the simulation result, it was identified that the initial project NPV was in the rage of-Rp. 6. 68 billion up to Rp. 18. 01 billion. The mean value of the projected NPV was Rp. 6. 27 billion. This project is considered to be risky to proceed, as there is 90 % probability the projected NPV < Rp. 0. After risk mitigation procedure will be applied, there is a mean value of the project NPV is Rp. 9. 9 billion (increase by 30 % from the initial NPV). Four significant risk variables affected NPV performance are identified as follow; (i) engineering cost for constructing water treatment plant and facilities, (ii) cost of pipelines <b>installation</b> and <b>accessories,</b> (ii) electricity costs, and (iv) chemical cost expenditure. A reduction of technical uncertainties including design changes; redundant of engineering risk costs, introduction of energy efficient technology during project operation may reduce electricity and chemical costs. Hence, based on the simulation results, it is confirmed that, the risk analyses procedure may improve regional SPAM regional technical and economy performances (e. i. NPV parameters) ...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 - 212 This {{paper will}} review the best {{practices}} for installation of a centrifugal air compressor without a sound enclosure to obtain the best acoustic environment for reduced operating noise levels. An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and <b>installation</b> of <b>accessory</b> hardware associated with the compressor installation will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and valves for noise reduction, drain line noise attenuation, inlet silencer selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction. In any case, when the compressor is in operation, the noise level measured with a sound level meter is often higher than the actual compressor generated noise. This paper will provide guidelines on how to achieve compressor installation noise objectives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Electrical {{installations}} {{contribute to}} 6 %- 10 % {{of the total}} cost of a typical house. Therefore, the selection of the most appropriate electrical accessories is very important from the client’s point of view. But lack of information about the products and prices makes these decisions very difficult for clients to make. Development of a product-cost model for the selection of electrical accessories could be seen as one of the solutions for this problem. Thus the authors have developed a product-cost model for the selection of electrical accessories for housing constructions in Sri Lanka. A market survey and a series of interviews were conducted in order to collect cost and product data pertaining to electrical accessories used in Sri Lankan domestic electrical <b>installations.</b> All the <b>accessories</b> identified were classified into five main categories based on their functionality. In the data analysis, three main cost categories were identified. On the other hand, three different designs were selected to represent the collection of accessories in a typical domestic electrical installation. Finally, a simple decision support system was developed as the front end for the developed product-cost model...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the <b>installation</b> of <b>accessories</b> on roofs is {{the domain}} of roofers, having the {{traditional}} knowledge and experience of successful mounting and integrating existing roof products in both new and renovated roofs. In the current roofing situation, many new products {{are added to the}} building design and building process. As a result many problems occurred, resulting in poor quality, unsafe working conditions and high repair costs. Today there is a need from the roofers for a more active role not only in the constructing process, but also in the design process; Collaborative Engineering. The active role for the roofer is therefore related to the several aspects of {{the context in which the}} roofer has to participate. The result should lead to innovative roofs, roofs that are producing sustainable energy and are active in the interaction with the thermal environment. First experiments to find a format for supporting Design Collaboration, started in 2004 with workshops for design- teams including participants with the same educational background. In 2005, a first set up was done for design teams with participants with different educational backgrounds. These workshops are coupling a concrete task from practice and research focusing on the roofs where there is a lack of innovative designs, caused by a sub-optimal interaction between solutions and application in design practice. The process where actors from different disciplines work together to develop a (new) product is called Collaborative Engineering (CE). Workshops are used to offer a collaborative context to professionals and to determine in steps an adaptive method to analyse and improve the design collaboration related to knowledge exchange. The project, as part of the European 6 th framework research EURACTIVE ROOFer, resulted in a series of workshops for architects and roofers to develop active roofs for integral sustainable comfort (HVAC) - system design, engineering and installation. The workshops gave first insights into the knowledge exchange and knowledge development between the participants. This paper describes the methodical backgrounds, the set-up of the EURACTIVE ROOFer-workshop and first results related to the knowledge management aspects...|$|R
40|$|Process Hospitalisation often erodes the {{feelings}} of toddlers and young children causing regressive behaviours and stress, which result in reduced cognitive performance, helplessness, restlessness, crying, anxiety, and elevated blood pressure. Having the ill children experiencing a garden setting, either in a passive or an active mode, can arouse their senses that nurture their inductive and deductive, motor-impulses development and reflective thinking capabilities. These interactions have resulted in psychological peacefulness and adjustment by the children including being more cooperative toward medication, less crying, more active and cheerful, and more obedient to caregivers. The outcomes are discovered in an experimental research done in year 2002 involving 360 paediatric patients experiencing the therapeutic gardens at two nucleus hospitals in Malaysia. Six design factors are considered to construct the garden: (1) spatial organisation and circulation, (2) garden setting, (3) sensory stimulation, (4) interaction of activities, (5) planting layout and composition, and (6) garden accessories. The garden is constructed in four steps including (1) demolition of existing garden, (2) preparation of base ground, (3) <b>installation</b> of garden <b>accessories,</b> and (4) planting work. The basis of constructing an effective garden for psychological well-being of ill children is relating the physical characters of the garden to the sensory stimulation of the children...|$|R

5000|$|The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the {{embossed}} running horse motif on {{the seat}} backs (the source for the [...] "pony interior" [...] nickname) {{in favor of a}} new deluxe interior package, which included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons, and special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965-66 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter trim caps, carried over from 1965-66, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped {{at the end of the}} 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965-66, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967-68 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the <b>installation</b> of the <b>accessory</b> atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of power supply {{has become an}} increasingly significant factor in modern society. The aging of the existing network, the increased quality requirements of electric supply {{and the risk of}} major interruptions due to storms are factors that are driving towards the cabling of the distribution network. It is important to develop a condition management process for medium voltage cables to be able to optimize the construction and total life cycle costs of such of a cable network. Due to its hidden structure the condition of a cable network can be evaluated only by means of measurements. It is widely acknowledged that a clear dependence exists between the deterioration of the cable and partial discharges. For years, partial discharge measurements have been used as part of condition management in case of single expensive electrical equipment like generator etc. and it is proofed to be a working solution. The goal of this work is to bring out the main principles of on-line partial discharge measurements and the current situation in case of extruded medium voltage cables. In addition, aging and other phenomena leading to faults and partial discharges related to these phenomena in extruded medium voltage cables have been studied. Finally, guidelines about how on-line partial discharge measurements could be used as part of condition monitoring of medium voltage cables have been created. The nature of this work is a literature survey and the source material mainly consists of international publications. The temperature, voltage stress and moisture are the main factors that accelerate the aging of solid insulation. Thus overloading should be avoided, voltage stresses should be minimized and water proof components should be used. Cable joints and terminations seem to be the most fault prone components in the medium voltage cable network and in most cases partial discharges can be spotted before the breakdown. It is also noted that the quality of workmanship in the <b>installation</b> of cable <b>accessories</b> plays an important role while the {{reliability of}} these components is concerned. This work concludes that on-line partial discharge measurements are the most suitable for detecting problems in the cable joints, terminations or metallic shield. The evaluation of the general condition of a cable system is very challenging with current on-line partial discharge measurement systems because voltage above normal operation voltage can’t be used during measurements. In addition, in many cases also the measurement sensitivity is not good enough. With continuous measurements, reliable time to next breakdown estimations can be made. The biggest challenges for continuous measurements are related to their cost-effectiveness. The future will show whether these kinds of measurement increase or not...|$|R
