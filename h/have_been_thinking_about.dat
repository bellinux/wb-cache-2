5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked up}} at her; she did not ask me what I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> nor remark upon my silence. She, too, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wrapped in revery; her face was grave. She raised her arms {{from the wall and}} stood up.|$|R
