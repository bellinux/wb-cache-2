5000|$|Window Installation: In the episode's first challenge, {{each team}} is {{required}} to remove the old single-pane windows from the kitchen area of their cabin, and install a double-glazed replacement. Since the new windows are larger than the ones they are replacing, each team will have to cut larger holes to fit the windows in. The installations will be tested by the experts spraying the window with a fire hose. The Pink Team prove to be by far the worst performers in this challenge, as uncertainty over how they should proceed and arguments between Danielle and Tyler see the project rapidly descend into total chaos. Matters nearly come to a head when Tyler comes dangerously close to slicing through a live electrical cable, and his carelessness and Danielle's screaming reaction causes an argument between the duo and Hillary. They take so long to cut their hole that the challenge ends before they can even attempt to install the window, and Danielle and Tyler are forced to take {{the full force of}} the fire hose through the empty hole as punishment for their failure. The Blue, Green and Purple teams all complete the job to a reasonable standard (albeit with Jake and Nicole on the Green Team continuing to argue fiercely during their project), but their windows leak due to inadequate usage of the expanding spray foam. At first sight the Red Team's window seems badly askew, but the experts are shocked to find that the window itself is actually perfectly level; the rest of their hut is in fact what's not level. The window itself holds up perfectly to the fire <b>hose</b> <b>test,</b> and so the team are named the winners of this challenge.|$|E

The burn itself is the long duration, up to 4 hours, but the <b>hose</b> stream <b>test</b> only lasts a few minutes, with large damage potential due to the sudden thermal and kinetic impacts, as the fire was upwards of 1,100 °C (see curves above), whereas the sudden hose-stream test is as cold as the domestic water fed to the fire hose used in the test, which might be 10-20 °C.

While the MEK and components of the MEK permeated in a few hours, it took several weeks for significant permeation of the aviation fuel and diesel.

40|$|The {{molecular}} and supramolecular {{origins of}} the superior nonlinear optical (NLO) properties observed in the organic phenolic triene material, OH 1 (2 -(3 -(4 -hydroxystyryl) - 5, 5 -dimethylcyclohex- 2 -enylidene) malononitrile), are presented. The molecular charge-transfer distribution is topographically mapped, demonstrating that a uniformly delocalized passive electronic medium facilitates the charge-transfer between the phenolic electron donor and the cyano electron acceptors which lie {{at opposite ends of}} the molecule. Its ability to act as a "push-pull" pi-conjugated molecule is quantified, relative to similar materials, by supporting empirical calculations; these include bond-length alternation and harmonic-oscillator stabilization energy (<b>HOSE)</b> <b>tests.</b> Such tests, together with frontier molecular orbital considerations, reveal that OH 1 can exist readily in its aromatic (neutral) or quinoidal (charge-separated) state, thereby overcoming the "nonlinearity-thermal stability trade-off". The HOSE calculation also reveals a correlation between the quinoidal resonance contribution to the overall structure of OH 1 and the UV-vis absorption peak wavelength in the wider family of configurationally locked polyene framework materials. Solid-state tensorial coefficients of the molecular dipole, polarizability, and the first hyperpolarizability for OH 1 are derived from the first-, second-, and third-order electronic moments of the experimental charge-density distribution. The overall solid-state molecular dipole moment is compared with those from gas-phase calculations, revealing that crystal field effects are very significant in OH 1. The solid-state hyperpolarizability derived from this charge-density study affords good agreement with gas-phase calculations as well as optical measurements based on hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) and electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation. This lends support to the further use of charge-density studies to calculate solid-state hyperpolarizability coefficients in other organic NLO materials. Finally, this charge-density study is also employed to provide an advanced classification of hydrogen bonds in OH 1, which requires more stringent criteria than those from conventional structure analysis. As a result, only the strongest OH center dot center NC interaction is so classified as a true hydrogen bond. Indeed, it is this electrostatic interaction that influences the molecular charge transfer: the other four, weaker, nonbonded contacts nonetheless affect the crystal packing. Overall, the establishment of these structure?property relationships lays a blueprint for designing further, more NLO efficient, materials in this industrially leading organic family of compounds. © 2013, American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of {{two types of}} aliphatic hydrocarbons resistant soft PVC hoses. A number of tests were performed to determine the internal structures {{and the difference between}} the <b>hoses.</b> First <b>tests</b> concerned with pentane resistance, the plasticizer and extender's effects on variations in the structure. The solubility of gas in plasticizer and the changing of morphology determined the applicability. The second analysis of FTIR results can show the internal structure’s composition, what the difference is between the two formulations. The weight changes of the hoses can shows the material’s gas resistance. The gas diffusion's driving force was the gas evaporation. The gas diffusion can be determined from the decrease of the quantity of the hydrocarbons. The internal structure was also observed by DMA. The measurement was made after a pentane soak of simple samples. The morphology, the material's density, mechanical properties and aliphatic hydrocarbon resistance of samples were determined.

40|$|Hoses can be {{components}} of fluid power control systems. To determine the dynamic behaviour of such systems {{you need to}} know the dynamic properties of the components included. This investigation aims to develop a method to determine these properties of hoses. Nitrile-black-carbon is used in hydraulic hoses. A literature study gives that rubber is a very complex material. It is viscoelastic with a lot of non-linearities so it is not self-evident how to model the hose. Four different models are studied. One of them gives an idea of the static relation between the rubber tube and the reinforcing. Two of them take the dynamic properties of rubber into account. The fourth model is a second order black box model. Laboratory tests have been done. The relationship between pressure changes and volume changes in hydraulic hoses at different frequencies is measured. Two seated valves were used, one for increasing and one for decreasing the pressure in the hose. The volume of oil coming out from the hose was measured with a cylinder.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from fast closing valves and activation of an emergency release coupling (ERC) in ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a fast closing 4 -inch full bore valve in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques.

In 2000, the Hong Kong SAR Government has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of biodiesel on in-service diesel-powered vehicles in Hong Kong and to compare the results with those using ultra low sulphur diesel (50 ppm sulphur) currently used in Hong Kong. Three types of biodiesel fuels were tested with different biodiesel/ULSD blending ratios. The whole study comprised of two parts, namely, a chassis dynamometer exhaust emission test (NOx, CO and HC 1) and a diesel lug down test for each of the vehicle tested. The result of the test is positive and confirms the environmental benefit of using biodiesel fuel. However, a very slight increased in NOx concentration is reported. During the course of the study, some issues related to the durability and fuel hoses compatibility have been raised that may affect the road worthiness of vehicles. In order to assess the compatibility of the rubber fuel hoses with biodiesel, a fuel <b>hose</b> compatibility <b>test</b> was performed to study the characteristics of fuel hoses subjected to fuels with different biodiesel percentages and with different durations.

The design and optimization of the structures and materials of AIS contributes to producing a quality reliable system, reducing noise, cost and weight at the same time, which are significant to improve the performance of engine and vehicle. Fresh air hoses/pipes are intended to transport, in air cleaner purified, air from the air cleaner to the throttle fitted on the inlet manifold or to the compressor fitted to the exhaust manifold.

40|$|Compressed air foam fire {{suppression}} systems (CAFS) were tested to measure the potential safety risks involved with its use compared to water. CAFS are mainly used in wildland firefighting, but could {{be more effective than}} water at extinguishing fires in interior settings. The purpose of these tests was to conclude if CAFS are safe for use in structural firefighting when compared to water. The tests conducted included measuring the nozzle reaction force, force required to kink a hose, force of friction on different walking surfaces, and the time required for foam and water to separate within a pressurized segment of hose. Nozzle reaction force was measured at flow rates between 80 and 200 GPM for compressed air foam and water. At each flow rate, CAFS had a greater transient and steady reaction force than those measured for water. The force required to kink hoses filled with CAFS was significantly higher than hoses filled with water while flowing and static. On five different interior floor surfaces, the force of friction required to pull a 200 pound weighted fire boot decreased when wet with water and when covered with CAFS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to aid in the development of Eaton Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s LifeSense program by developing a hydraulic hose rated for high pressure use but also utilizing the LifeSense technology. Eaton supplied samples of current and newly mixed rubber compounds, which were used in various lab bench testing to determine usable compounds for the hose prototypes. The lab bench tests were completed using an Agilent LCR meter and Dielectric Test Fixture. New capacitance bridge hose construction designs were developed at Purdue, and the materials for the prototype were selected from the list of supplied materials. Selections of materials were made based on prior work done by researchers at Purdue, including Michael McCoy and Timu Gallien. ^ Hose construction was done by Eaton and sample <b>hoses</b> were <b>tested</b> in the lab using an impulse testing chamber. The resistance data was collected in an Excel file and presented to Purdue in graphical form. Only five samples out of two different series of tests did not fail as a result of fittings blown off {{of the end of the}} hose. Furthermore, only one of the five samples produced results as expected, but there was considerable noise present in the data. Ultimately, there was not enough testing to draw conclusive results. The resistance monitoring methods used by Eaton were insufficient to predict failure because the designs are based on a capacitance bridge. It is recommended that, for the advancement of the research, Eaton monitor both capacitance and resistance on future testing. It was also advised that when a sample shows fluctuation in data at mid-life, as seen in some of the results, hoses be removed from test and dissected to determine if the actual cause of fluctuations is a result of the failures trying to be detected. ...|$|R

From these laboratory tests it was possible to choose the suitable hose size. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of boom sprinkler machines before and after modification. Using the boom machine with drag hoses mounted on the boom system at a medium or low pressure instead of the sprinklers can be an alternative to the use of boom systems in some crops and topographical conditions. The water loss can be minimized with this system. The results indicated that, the hose with orifice plate diameter of 4 mm was chosen at operating pressure ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 bar.

It had a 10 mil thick copper evaporator and a 10 mil thick copper condenser end cap. The bulk of the condenser was 2 mil thick copper covered by a one inch diameter Nextel 312 woven <b>hose.</b> A life <b>test</b> was run within the Heat Pipe Test Facility, a chamber used to simulate low earth orbit. The life test lasted for over 800 hours, during which time the reflux tube operated steadily with no drop in performance. At {{the end of the}} test the reflux tube was removed and observed. The only noticeable change was a slight discoloration of the Nextel 312 used to cover the condenser. This discoloration was consistent with previously observed phenomenon. The second topic, fabric wicking rate studies were done as a follow up study to the dry uptake tests previously conducted at Oregon State University. The purpose of the tests were to get a relative feel for the ability of different fabrics to wick water. This was achieved using a drop test in which the fabrics were laid out on a bridge connecting two containers. One of the containers was elevated above the other. The fabrics were allowed to wick water from the upper container to the lower container and the rate at which this was accomplished was measured.

Black solids are often associated with oxidized manganese. One home located on Mandan Crescent, for example, had persistent problems despite plumbing changes. While flushing the service line, an action undertaken to remove as much material as possible, a water sample was collected and found to have 244, 000 parts per billion (ppb) manganese, a level nearly 1000 times the lifetime health advisory level of 300 ppb. Additional samples were collected at the original residence, three other area homes, and a neighborhood school. All of the samples had manganese levels below the EPA secondary standard of 50 ppb except for one that had 719 ppb manganese. The high manganese sample was taken from an exterior hose bib {{that had not been}} used during the winter. Subsequent samples taken from the same exterior <b>hose</b> bib later <b>tested</b> at 11 ppb manganese or less. This series of events raised concerns in the neighborhood about the safety of the tap water, which later spread to other areas of the city. Well 10 served the Nakoma and other near west neighborhoods, mostly year-round, since it went into service in 1951. Annual manganese tests at Well 10 over the past decade have ranged from 38 - 60 ppb. In 2003, it was converted to a seasonal well, with planned operation from April to October each year.

30|$|We {{consider}} the water-jet {{as a good}} option to be implemented as propulsion source for a probe since a water-jet can be generated via the transfer of water through a long hose with constant and relatively small diameter from a water source to an output nozzle. Additionally, such a water-jet generates a thrust force that can be controlled by the regulation of the flow rate. Taking into account that this system requires control in open areas, three different configurations are suggested. The first one is a configuration similar to the tendril from NASA with the difference that only one actuated section is required at the tip; in this way, {{it is possible to}} position the tip in the desired place in the three-dimensional space. The water-jet is directed partially backwards to the longitudinal axis of the hose, {{in the same way as}} in the piping inspection devices, and via the regulation of the flow rate, the magnitude of the thrust force can be controlled. The second option is by regulating the water-jet through servo-valves. Similar to continuum robots, at least three actuation elements are necessary to control the motion in three-dimensional space. Thus, it requires independent control of each water-jet. This necessitates at least three servo valves which should be placed at the tip of the probe in order to regulate the opening of the orifices of each water-jet, thereby controlling the flow rate and thrust force. However, the need of servo valves at the tip will increase the diameter of the device and the complexity of the manufacture. Finally, the last proposal is a device with no mobile element at the tip. Instead, it has three nozzles in circular arrangement directed partially backward. Each water-jet is generated independently, which means that each nozzle has its own feeding hose and independent pump. By regulating the speed of each pump, the flow and thrust force are controlled. Because the last option is the easiest to implement, we chose the three <b>hose</b> configuration to <b>test</b> the concept. A more detailed study of the generation of water-jet thrust force is presented next.|$|R
