According to ‘Rainbow Tick’; while diversity is everywhere, inclusion isn’t; and it will soon become a matter of competitive sustainability for organisations to effectively manage ‘inclusively’ within this diverse environment. While there is a growing trend to utilise social media and e-recruitment to attract new talent, and to address person-organisation fit; this study seeks to explore whether these tools actually enable ‘inclusive recruitment’, or in fact increase the likelihood of unethical practises and homogeneous organisations. This review acknowledges the need for New Zealand organisations to stay commercially viable, and to increase awareness of the global marketplace in which they operate. It also provides recommendations for employers to take a critical look at their recruitment processes as they evolve from a purely Human Resources function to wider organisational responsibility, which integrates with Strategic Objectives, Communications and Brand Management strategies...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} the longitudinal analysis of business start-ups using three waves of data from the Kauffman Firm Survey. ^ The first essay used the data from years 2004 - 2008, and examined the simultaneous relationship between a firm 2 ̆ 7 s capital structure, human resource policies, {{and its impact on}} the level of innovation. The firm leverage was calculated as, debt divided by total financial resources. <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> well-being was determined by a set of nine dichotomous questions asked in the survey. A negative binomial fixed effects model was used to analyze the effect <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> well-being and leverage on the count data of patents and copyrights, which were used as a proxy for innovation. The paper demonstrated that employee well-being positively affects the firm 2 ̆ 7 s innovation, while a higher leverage ratio had a negative impact on the innovation. No significant relation was found between leverage and employee well-being. ^ The second essay used the data from years 2004 - 2009, and inquired whether a higher entrepreneurial speed of learning is desirable, and whether there is a linkage between the speed of learning and growth rate of the firm. The change in the speed of learning was measured using a pooled OLS estimator in repeated cross-sections. There was evidence of a declining speed of learning over time, and it was concluded that a higher speed of learning is not necessarily a good thing, because speed of learning is contingent on the entrepreneur 2 ̆ 7 s initial knowledge, and the precision of the signals he receives from the market. Also, there was no reason to expect speed of learning to be related to the growth of the firm in one direction over another. ^ The third essay used the data from years 2004 - 2010, and determined the timing of diversification activities by the business start-ups. It captured when a start-up diversified for the first time, and explored the association between an early diversification strategy adopted by a firm, and its survival rate. A semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the survival pattern. The results demonstrated that firms diversifying at an early stage in their lives show a higher survival rate; however, this effect fades over time. ...|$|R

The task of the study is to answer the queries: 1) Are the persons involved in inventiveness serives able (and the what extent) to affect the dynamics of development of rationalization and inventiveness movement What effect des it have on technical innovations suggested by employees? 2) Is the staff pairticipation in the agricultural enterprise influencing (and to what extent) the range of social recognition <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> inventiveness in their enterprise? To answer the first query, organizational structures in the examined agricultural enterprises were analysed and persons active there were characterized. The research proves that there are two levels, to be differentiated in the organizational structures of the inventiveness and rationalization movement. The superior one is visible in the inventiveness services and commissions (state machinery centers, state farms), the lower, in separate posts concerned with inventiveness and, to a small extent, inventiveness commissions (county cooperatives „Samopomoc Chłopska" and cooperatives of agriculturals associations. The organizational level is the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>employee's</b> inventiveness in the respect of number of author and of their suggestions:. Characteristics of persons involved prove that a development of the movement depends on their knowledge of patent laws, understanding of their enterprise's specifics., and on their technical knowledge. The analysas of the staff's interest; in worker's inventiveness became grounds to answer the second query- It lis proved by the survey that a function of a chairman of enterprises inventiveness commision is usually taken up by the deputy technological director and his activity in those commissions effects the development in an agricultural enterprise. Yet, the rank of inventions suggested by the employees increases considerably when a director or his deputy are the co-authors of the project of invention. In other words, a social recognition for rationalizers increases in relation to the staff's personal interest in the rationalization and inventiveness movement.

This research setout to identify the important factors concerned with retaining of IT skilled staff in small and medium scale companies. The research initiated with an in depth literature survey to understand employee motivation and retention. Thereafter, a questionnaire was prepared to capture information on various factors that motivate employee, demographics and turnover intension <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> in another couple of year's time. This study also learned the strategies adopted by these software companies to retain their staff. // From the company interviews it became apparent that the companies did not carryout many specific strategies with the motive of retaining their staff. The results <b>of</b> the <b>employee</b> survey indicated {{the most important}} factor was friendly environment or coworker relationship next to keeping up-to-date with technology. It was also evident that the importance of factors varied with each demographic factor <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> such as sex, marital-status and level of IT experience.

Leisure-time {{physical}} inactivity {{is a global}} public health concern affecting all people in different walks <b>of</b> life, including <b>employees.</b> This inactivity is associated with chronic diseases of lifestyle as well as low work capacity. The {{purpose of this study}} was two-fold: to determine leisure-time physical activity (LTPAI), coronary risk- (CRI), health status (HSI) and lifestyle (LSI) <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> some executive <b>employees</b> in selected African countries; and to determine the effect of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on the coronary risk-, health status- and lifestyle- <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> some executive <b>employees</b> in selected African countries. A cross-sectional study design was followed on a group of 156 (mean age 41. 22 ± 10. 17) executive employees. Participants were grouped according to age (46 years). Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data. Out of 156 participants in the study, 43 % occupied top level management and 57 % middle level management positions. When data were analyzed according to age groups, 31 % and 69 % in the less than 35 years age group were in the top and the middle level management, respectively. In the age group 36 to 46 years of age, 47 % were in the top level of management and 52. 8 % middle level management. With regard to LTPA, top level managers (71. 6 %) scored low LTPA as compared to middle level managers (62. 9 %). Top level managers scored higher percentages (14. 9 %) for developing the risk of coronary heart disease. The results show a negative effect of physical activity on selected health parameters, with significant negative relationships between low LTPA and daily lifestyle index (r= - 0. 52; p= 0. 01), and moderate LTPA and daily lifestyle index (r= - 0. 71; p< 0. 001) for middle managers. It can be concluded that both top and middle level managers exhibited low LTPA and high risk for developing coronary heart disease. It was apparent that the managers in low LTPA are prone to bad stages of life style, health status and coronary risk- indexes compared to the ones with moderate and high LTPA. Additionally, low and moderate LTPA inversely affected selected health parameters <b>of</b> executive <b>employees.</b> No significant association was found for high LTPA with selected health parameters. The study therefore recommends a strategic intervention programme geared towards improving the present state of affairs among the managers in the corporate environment. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Physical {{inactivity}} {{is identified}} {{as one of the}} major risk factors for the development of coronary heart diseases. It has been well documented in research literature that regular engagement in physical activity and healthy lifestyle habits has a positive influence on the risk of developing coronary heart diseases. Research literature reveals that these diseases have a negative influence on the productivity <b>of</b> the <b>employee.</b> In the light of the above mentioned, the fact has become clear that the health <b>of</b> the <b>employee</b> is <b>of</b> major concern to the employer. Healthy employees mean better productivity and better financial benefits for the company. The aim of this research is therefore to determine the physical activity, lifestyle and coronary <b>index</b> profiles <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> working at an electricity supply company in South Africa. Furthermore the aim is to determine the influence of physical activity and lifestyle on the coronary health of the same population. A total of one hundred and seventy nine (N= 179) voluntary subjects between the ages of 26 and 65 years (46. 1 ± 9. 5), who were part of a non-random availability population, took part in the study. Data was collected by means of questionnaires. The Physical Activity <b>Index</b> questionnaire <b>of</b> Sharkey and Gaskill (2007) was used to collect data on the physical activity of respondents, the Lifestyle <b>Index</b> questionnaire <b>of</b> Belloc and Breslow (1972) was used to determine the lifestyle practises of the respondents and the Coronary Risk <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> Bjiirstrom en Alexiou (1978) was used to determine the coronary risk <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the respondents. The physical activity <b>index</b> profile <b>of</b> the respondents was classified as average (25. 6 ± 35. 6), {{as was the case with}} their lifestyle index profile (4. 5 ± 1. 3) and coronary risk index profile (25. 5 ± 7. 5). In spite of these findings, it was found that the majority of respondents in fact led a sedentary life (58. 1 %). That means that the respondents have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. The results further showed that age, exercise, gender and stress was identified as the major contributors to increased risk of developing coronary heart diseases. The fact emerged that the majority of respondents were unaware of their cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure status. These findings are problematic, for it is well documented in research literature that these three factors are major contributors to the development of coronary heart disease. In terms of the influence of physical activity and lifestyle on coronary health, a statistic meaningful (p < 0. 05) difference was found in terms of physical activity and lifestyle habits on the coronary health <b>of</b> the <b>employees.</b> Wellness programs that are implemented by companies are of great value. These programs give the workers the opportunity to take responsibility for their health and provide them with the necessary tools to manage their health on optimal levels. Companies that succeed in motivating their staff to engage in these wellness programs, can empower their staff to care for their own health. This means less risk of developing coronary heart diseases, increased productivity and decreased absenteeism, sick leave and medical costs. Master...|$|R

40|$|Employee {{wellbeing}} programmes {{are adding}} value to corporate businesses in South Africa (Keet, 2009 :iv). This value is mainly {{described in the}} sense of return on investment. Return on investment is viewed as the ratio in terms of the programme profits with regards to the invested capital in the programme (Cascio, 2000 : 127). The focus {{of this study was to}} determine the impact <b>of</b> an <b>employee</b> wellbeing programme on return on investment in terms <b>of</b> absenteeism and <b>employee</b> psychosocial functioning within a South African context. A research gap exists in current South African research to understand the impact <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> wellbeing programmes on return on investment in terms <b>of</b> absenteeism and <b>employee</b> psychosocial functioning (Keet, 2009 : 26). This study attempted to theoretically contextualise and conceptualise employee wellbeing programmes with specific emphasis on return on investment in corporate businesses, as well as absenteeism and employee psychosocial functioning in the workplace. An employee wellbeing programme was investigated to determine the impact on return on investment in terms <b>of</b> absenteeism and <b>employee</b> psychosocial functioning. Quantitative data was collected through making use <b>of</b> <b>indexes</b> from <b>employees</b> who have made use <b>of</b> an <b>employee</b> wellbeing programme for a specific corporate client in South Africa. The indexes were set up to collect data on absenteeism and employee psychosocial functioning. Valuable conclusions emanated from the findings of this research study. A reduction of 32. 08 % in absenteeism was recorded for respondents who were absent after employee wellbeing programme interventions were introduced. A further valuable finding that emanated of this research study was that an improvement of 6. 92 % within the post-employee psychosocial functioning scores occurred after employee wellbeing programme interventions were introduced to the respondents. The study was also concluded with some useful and relevant recommendations from the information collected on how to determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> wellbeing programmes on return on investment. One of the recommendations drawn from the findings of this research study was that future research studies on return on investment should be conducted over a minimum period of three years to derive even more accurate results. Another recommendation was that employers and employee wellbeing programme service providers should ensure that employee psychosocial functioning is measured as a standard indicator within employee wellbeing programmes across South Africa.

30|$|Union {{membership}} (UM), {{defined as}} the ratio <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> that are trade union members, divided {{by the total number}} <b>of</b> <b>employees.</b> The ratio <b>of</b> union density of public sector workers to the union density of private sector workers (UD_RATIO), an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> coordination of wage-setting (COORD); an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> centralization of wage bargaining, taking into account both union authority and union concentration at multiple levels (CENT). 13 These variables are defined and compiled in the ICTWSS database (see Visser (2013)). The UD_RATIO {{can be thought of as}} a proxy of the relative power of the public sector unions. COORD can be thought of as a measure of union cooperation, and CENT can be thought of as a measure of internalization of wage setting externalities. UM can be thought of as a measure of the power of unions, in general. Given our theory, in countries with IOS characteristics, one should expect WPR (TSL) to correlate positively (negatively) with UD_RATIO and negatively (positively) with CENT and CORD. Since UM characterize wage setting in the economy as a whole, and, for example, high UM may be associated with higher wages in both the private and the public sector, its correlation with WPR is not clear. On the other hand, in countries with IOS characteristics, one should expect a negative correlation with TSL: although high UM implies that all unions have relatively high power, still it is professional associations that set tax breaks as their priority.|$|R
30|$|Former {{studies have}} shown, that work quality is {{closely linked to}} work ability (Tuomi et al. 2001). Specifically, supervisor-employee-fit has been {{considered}} to be a predictor for work ability in older employees (Ilmarinen and Tempel 2002). Our results reveal that a misfit between self- and supervisor ratings has a significant impact on job satisfaction in white but not blue collar workers and in workers above 30 years of age (see Table  5 and Fig.  1). We found that self- and supervisor-rated abilities in task general aspects such as task complexity and learning lead to lower work ability scores and to less job satisfaction. In particular, we found that a misfit between self- and supervisor rated ability to learn new tasks had a negative influence on work ability <b>index</b> scores <b>of</b> the <b>employees.</b> The middle aged employees {{and to a lesser extent}} the older age group showed the strongest impact on adapted WAI scores as compared to the young group. These findings support the need of age specific human resource management and personal interactions between employees and their individual supervisor to prevent wrong evaluations based on age stereo-types and negative images of age (Bennett and Gaines 2010).|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a system of indicators which reflect the level <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> empowerment in an organisation. To be able to do this, a literature study on employee empowerment was conducted. This study considered employee empowerment as a multi-dimensional concept within organisations, with the aim of identifying crucial components needed for an organisation to empower employees. Existing scale development methodology was used to develop a scale to measure employee empowerment. Similarly, existing methodology surrounding the development of indicators was used to construct specific indicators for the organisation in which the research was conducted. The reason existing methodologies were used was that the focus of the study was not on the development of the methodology itself, but on the development <b>of</b> an <b>employee</b> empowerment scale as well as a set of indicators which demonstrate employee empowerment. Scale development methodology specifies that four phases, nine main moments and twenty four steps are required to develop a scale. Indicator development methodology consists of five stages. Each stage has main moments and operational elements. These processes were explained, and their applicability to this study demonstrated. In the course of the literature study, seven dimensions <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> empowerment were identified and discussed, namely power, morale, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, meaningfulness, self-determination and trust. For an organisation to be empowered, nine dimensions were identified, namely vision, transparency and teamwork, discipline and control, support and security, responsibility, information, rewards, decision-making and training. In considering the assessment <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> empowerment, the implementation as well as possible limitations and pitfalls <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> empowerment were discussed. The role management plays in this regard was also examined. An overview of the organisation in which the research was conducted was given. This overview explained the history of the factory and how it operates today. Data analysis consisted of the descriptive characteristics of the sample. A factor and reliability analysis was done. Comparisons were drawn between the empirical factors and variables. Cross tabulations were conducted between different sections of the questionnaire. Assessing the degree of validation and reliability of this study was the next step. Reliability was measured by means of a split half reliability and coefficient alpha. Validity was assessed in terms of face validity, content validity and factor analysis. The crucial component of this study was the development of indicators. This was done by examining the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> indicators and identifying significant indicators. Each of the three factors identified in this study were compared statistically to the significant indicators. Through additional linear regression, the final <b>index</b> <b>of</b> qualifying indicator variables were identified. These indicators reflect the level <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> empowerment. The study concludes by providing recommendations for future research as well as recommendations regarding the empowerment <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> within the factory. Dr. W. Roestenburg Dr. E.
