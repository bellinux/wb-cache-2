25|$|Once {{the utility}} of the horse as a means of {{transportation}} became clear the horses (actually ponies) began being bred for strength, and by the 3rd millennium BC they were strong enough to pull chariots. By 2000 BC, war chariots had spoked wheels, thus being made more manoeuvrable, and dominated the battlefields. The growing use of the horse, combined with the failure, roughly around 2000 BC, of the always precarious irrigation systems that had allowed for <b>extensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> in the region, gave rise and dominance of pastoral nomadism by 1000 BC, {{a way of life that}} would dominate the region for the next several millennia.|$|E

25|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastery}} quickly became an {{important}} and powerful presence in Portugal. The monastery owned and developed <b>extensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> areas, and the abbot exerted influence over a large area. A public school was opened in 1269. The importance of the monastery can be measured {{by the fact that}} many monarchs were buried here in the 13th and 14th centuries. Kings Afonso II, Afonso III, and their Queens Urraca of Castile and Beatrice of Castile are buried here, as well as King Pedro I and his mistress, Inês de Castro, who was murdered on the orders of Pedro's father, King Afonso IV. After being crowned King, Pedro commissioned two magnificent Gothic tombs for him and his mistress, both of which can still be seen inside the monastery church.|$|E
25|$|The import {{and export}} of foreign wares, and the {{revenues}} derived from taxing their transit, was {{a hallmark of}} the Khazar economy, though it is said also to have produced isinglass. Distinctively among the nomadic steppe polities, the Khazar Qağanate developed a self-sufficient domestic Saltovo economy, a combination of traditional pastoralism – allowing sheep and cattle to be exported – <b>extensive</b> <b>agriculture,</b> abundant use of the Volga's rich fishing stocks, together with craft manufacture, with a diversification in lucrative returns from taxing international trade given its pivotal control of major trade routes. The Khazars constituted one of the two great furnishers of slaves to the Muslim market (the other being the Iranian Sâmânid amîrs), supplying it with captured Slavs and tribesmen from the Eurasian northlands. It was profits from the latter which enabled it to maintain a standing army of Khwarezm Muslim troops. The capital Atil reflected the division: Kharazān on the western bank where the king and his Khazar elite, with a retinue of some 4,000 attendants, dwelt, and Itil proper to the East, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims and slaves and by craftsmen and foreign merchants. The ruling elite wintered in the city and spent from spring to late autumns in their fields. A large irrigated greenbelt, drawing on channels from the Volga river, lay outside the capital, where meadows and vineyards extended for some 20 farsakhs (ca. 60 miles?). While customs duties were imposed on traders, and tribute and tithes were exacted from 25–30 tribes, with a levy of one sable skin, squirrel pelt, sword, dirham per hearth or ploughshare, or hides, wax, honey and livestock, depending on the zone. Trade disputes were handled by a commercial tribunal in Atil consisting of seven judges, two for each of the monotheistic inhabitants (Jews, Muslims, Christians) and one for the pagans.|$|E
500|$|Juan was {{the last}} of three hurricanes to move over Louisiana during the season, after Danny in August and Elena in early September. It formed rapidly in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, allowing little time for thorough preparations or the evacuation of offshore oil rigs. As a result, nine people died in maritime accidents off Louisiana. Onshore, the hurricane dropped torrential rain totaling [...] in Galliano, Louisiana. The combination of the rainfall and a high storm surge flooded 50,000houses and many communities in southern Louisiana, causing <b>extensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> losses. Damage in Louisiana alone approached $1billion (1985USD). Elsewhere, flooding in Texas forced the closure of roadways, while heavy rains damaged crops and houses in southern Mississippi. The outer rainbands of Juan spawned 15tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle, causing over $1million in damage. Overall, Juan directly inflicted about $1.5billion in damage, making it among the costliest United States hurricanes, and there were 12deaths. This excludes the effects from the subsequent flooding in the Mid-Atlantic.|$|E

30|$|Fencing is {{considered}} a prerequisite for all intensively farmed areas to reduce the risks of damage to crops from wandering animals. Barbed wire fencing is costly, and research has shown it to be uneconomic as an investment {{in the context of}} eastern Mauritania, as production can rarely pay off the cost of investment before the fence becomes obsolete (Ronco et al. 1999). Finally, investment in fertilisers, pesticides, ploughs and improved seed varieties is required to maximise production.
