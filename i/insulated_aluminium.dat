40|$|To {{overcome}} communication {{difficulties in}} the Norwegian landscape of mountains and fjords, 850 road tunnels have been built. Half of these tunnels have a traffic volume less than 1000 ADT, as they are primarily links to scattered settlements. Panels made of frost <b>insulated,</b> <b>aluminium</b> corrugated sheets and PE-foam linings have been in extensive use. Recently, shotcrete/PE foam linings, PVC-coated polyester fabric linings and prefabricated concrete elements of special designs have been introduced. Applying seperate methods to accomplish the rock support and the water/frost protection {{is one of the}} basic principles of the NPRA road tunnel design. It has been found that this yields an optimum between performance and economy...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{electrical}} characterization on <b>insulating</b> <b>aluminium</b> nitride (AlN) {{and conducting}} tungsten (W) films was performed using dedicated test structures, {{in order to}} determine the thickness at which the films reached continuity. A discontinuous-to-continuous transformation of the AlN layer (occurring around 11 nm) resulted in a transition from ohmic to non-ohmic current conduction, in addition to drastically reduced current density levels. For similar transformation of the W layer (occurring between 2 - 3 nm) the reverse transition was observed, which was accompanied by a rapid convergence of the film resistivity to the bulk value. The electrical analysis of film continuity was complemented optically by in-situ monitoring of the film growth and its closure, with the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) technique...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study of non-equilibrium {{phenomena}} observed in the electrical conductance of <b>insulating</b> granular <b>aluminium</b> thin films. An anomalous field effect and its slow relaxation are studied in some detail. The phenomenology {{is very similar to}} the one already observed in indium oxide. The origin of the phenomena is discussed. In granular systems, the present experiments can naturally be interpreted along two different lines. One relies on a slow polarisation in the dielectric surrounding the metallic islands. The other one relies on a purely electronic mechanism: the formation of an electron Coulomb glass in the granular metal. More selective experiments and/or quantitative predictions about the Coulomb glass properties are still needed to definitely distinguish between the two scenarii.

40|$|We perform {{electrical}} {{field effect}} measurements at 4 K on <b>insulating</b> granular <b>aluminium</b> thin films. When the samples size is reduced below 100 micrometers, reproducible and stable conductance fluctuations {{are seen as}} a function of the gate voltage. Our results suggest that these fluctuations reflect the incomplete self-averaging of largely distributed microscopic resistances. We also study the anomalous field effect (conductance dip) already known to exit in large samples and its slow conductance relaxation in the presence of the conductance fluctuations. Within our measurements accuracy, the two phenomena appear to be independent of each other, like two additive contributions to the conductance. We discuss the possible physical meaning of this independence and in particular whether or not this observation is in favor of an electron glass interpretation of slow conductance anomaly relaxations.

The present work is devoted to the occurrence of ageing, a benchmark phenomenon for the glassy state. It {{is the fact that the}} dynamical properties of a glass depend on its age, i. e. on the time elapsed since it was quench-cooled. We first critically analyse previous studies on disordered insulators and question their interpretation in terms of ageing. We then present new measurements on <b>insulating</b> granular <b>aluminium</b> thin films which demonstrate that the dynamics is indeed age dependent. We also show that the results of different relaxation protocols are related by a superposition principle.

50|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized {{electrolytic capacitors}} whose anode electrode (+) {{is made of}} a pure aluminum foil with an etched surface. The aluminum forms a very thin <b>insulating</b> layer of <b>aluminium</b> oxide by anodization that acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A non-solid electrolyte covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, serving in principle as the second electrode (cathode) (-) of the capacitor. A second aluminum foil called “cathode foil” contacts the electrolyte and serves as the electrical connection to the negative terminal of the capacitor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectron-beam {{deposition}} of an <b>insulating</b> granular <b>aluminium</b> or of an off-stoichiometric amorphous alumina {{layer on a}} SrT iO 3 surface is {{a simple way to}} get a metallic interface from insulating materials. No heating nor specific preparation of the SrT iO 3 surface are needed. In this paper, we investigate how the electrical properties of this interface can be tuned by the use of a back gate voltage (electrical field through the SrT iO 3 substrate). We demonstrate that the slow field-effect observed at room temperature can be used to tune reversibly and in a controlled way the low temperature electrical properties of the interface. In particular, important parameters of a transistor such as the amplitude of the resistance response to gate voltage changes or the existence of an " on " or an " off " state at zero gate voltage and at low temperature can be adjusted in a single sample. This method should be applicable to any SrT iO 3 -based interface in which oxygen vacancies are involved and might provide a powerful way to study the metal or superconductor insulator transition observed in such systems...|$|R

We have explored how the conductance relaxations induced by gate voltage changes depend on the age of the system, namely the time elapsed since its quench at low temperature. A clear age dependence of the relaxations is seen, qualitatively similar to ageing effects seen in other well studied glassy systems such as spin glasses or polymers. We explain how our results differ from the previous ones obtained with different protocols in indium oxide and granular aluminium thin films.

The profiles comprised {{a mixture}} of different synthetic components. The materials involved are based mostly on polyamide. This factory dries the polymer granules before the extrusion and stores it temporarily. The additives are necessary {{for the improvement of}} the thermal properties of the polyamide. The production system includes six extrusion machines. The number of screws (one or two) and their diameter are the main differences between the extruder processes. Directly after the continuous processing the profiles are cut into single pieces. Next additional features like adhesive ribbon, wire and/or polyurethane foam are inserted into the profiles. Other customising processes include punching and drilling.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} would benefit from MEMS devices that can produce very strong electrical fields with high potential differences; in particular the production and acceleration of ions or charged droplets for spacecraft or biomedical applications. We have carried out investigations into the use of silicon dioxide as an insulator in MEMS devices designed for such applications. The work focuses on axisymmetric electrode configurations that produce 10 8 V/m electrical fields close to the axis, in vacuum. To accelerate ions to high velocities (&# 62; 100 m/s) potentials of over 1 kV are required. MOS devices, consisting of <b>aluminium</b> <b>insulated</b> from the silicon substrate by SiO 2, were produced {{with a number of}} different geometries. Thermal oxides of 2 m thickness and thermal oxides augmented by 2 m of CVD oxide were tested for the maximum voltage held before permanent destruction. The insulator surface between two electrodes placed 50 m apart, successfully held voltages of over 3 kV without surface flashover. We have shown that breakdown occurred through the oxide with a mean hold-off voltage of 1340 V for 2 m oxides and 2960 V for 4 m oxides. In the course of the experiments, we have found the importance of chip cleanliness, voltage polarity and the external measuring circuit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{development}} of a novel photovoltaic device based on organometal halide perovskites. The initial focus of this thesis begins with the study of lighttrapping strategies in solid-state dye-sensitised solar cells (detailed in chapter 3). While I report enhancement in device performance through the application of near and far-ﬁeld light-trapping techniques, I ﬁnd that improvements remain step-wise due to fundamental limitations currently employed in dye-sensitised solar cell technology— notably, the available light-sensitising materials. I found a promising yet under researched family of materials in the methyl ammonium tri-halide plumbate perovskite (detailed in chapter 4). The perovskite light-sensitiser was applied to the traditional mesoscopic sensitised solar cell device architecture as a replacement to conventional dye yielding world-record breaking photo-conversion e!ciencies for solid-state sensitised solar cells as high as 8. 5 %. The system was further developed leading to the conception of a novel device architecture, termed the mesoporous superstructured solar cell (MSSC), this new architecture replaces the conventional mesoporous titanium dioxide semiconductor with a porous <b>insulating</b> oxide in <b>aluminium</b> oxide, resulting in very low fundamental losses evidenced through high photo-generated open-circuit voltages of over 1. 1 V.
