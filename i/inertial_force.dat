25|$|In physics, the Coriolis {{force is}} an <b>inertial</b> <b>force</b> that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion {{relative}} to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the <b>inertial</b> <b>force</b> or fictitious force {{known as}} {{centrifugal}} force, which always exists {{in addition to}} the reactive force in the rotating frame of reference, the reactive force is a real Newtonian force that is observed in any reference frame. [...] The two forces will only have the same magnitude in the special cases where circular motion arises and where the axis of rotation is the origin of the rotating frame of reference. It is the reactive force {{that is the subject of}} this article.|$|E
5000|$|Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> to viscous forces.

25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} a {{dimensionless}} quantity which characterises {{the magnitude of}} inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects.

2500|$|The gradual {{acceptance}} of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of Niels Bohr's {{model of the}} atom created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles. [...] Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the [...] "general theory of relativity") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the <b>inertial</b> <b>force</b> of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading {{to the conclusion that}} space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as gravitational lensing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} an earthquake excitation, it interacts with the foundation and the soil, and thus changes {{the motion of the}} ground. [...] Soil-structure interaction broadly can be divided into two phenomena: a) kinematic interaction and b) inertial interaction. [...] Earthquake ground motion causes soil displacement known as free-field motion. [...] However, the foundation embedded into the soil will not follow the free field motion. [...] This inability of the foundation to match the free field motion causes the kinematic interaction. [...] On the other hand, the mass of the superstructure transmits the <b>inertial</b> <b>force</b> to the soil, causing further deformation in the soil, which is termed as inertial interaction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} of virtual work {{had always been}} used in some form since antiquity {{in the study of}} statics. It was used by the Greeks, medieval Arabs and Latins, and Renaissance Italians as [...] "the law of lever". The idea of virtual work was invoked by many notable physicists of the 17th century, such as Galileo, Descartes, Torricelli, Wallis, and Huygens, in varying degrees of generality, when solving problems in statics. Working with Leibnizian concepts, [...] Johann Bernoulli systematized the virtual work principle and made explicit the concept of infinitesimal displacement. He was able to solve problems for both rigid bodies as well as fluids. Bernoulli's version of virtual work law appeared in his letter to Pierre Varignon in 1715, which was later published in Varignon's second volume of Nouvelle mécanique ou Statique in 1725. This formulation of the principle is today known as the {{principle of}} virtual velocities and is commonly considered as the prototype of the contemporary virtual work principles. In 1743 D'Alembert published his Traite de Dynamique where he applied the principle of virtual work, based on Bernoulli's work, to solve various problems in dynamics. His idea was to convert a dynamical problem into static problem by introducing <b>inertial</b> <b>force.</b> In 1768, Lagrange presented the virtual work principle in a more efficient form by introducing generalized coordinates and presented it as an alternative principle of mechanics by which all problems of equilibrium could be solved. A systematic exposition of Lagrange's program of applying this approach to all of mechanics, both static and dynamic, essentially D'Alembert's principle, was given in his Méchanique Analytique of 1788. Although Lagrange had presented his version of least action principle prior to this work, he recognized the virtual work principle to be more fundamental mainly because it could be assumed alone as the foundation for all mechanics, unlike the modern understanding that least action does not account for non-conservative forces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The retarded {{gravitation}} {{produced by}} the matter and energy content of the observable universe is formulated and shown how this cosmological gravity gives rise to <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> in accelerated frames of reference. The model is developed for spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universes. The retarded potential of cosmological gravity is determined first in fundamental frames of reference, in Einstein-de Sitter (ES) and in ΛCDM models. Despite the expansion, the observable universe {{gives rise to a}} static, retarded gravitational potential of ΦE = − c 2 in ES universe, while gravity is weakening during the expansion in ΛCDM model. In the locally Minkowski spacetime occurring in a small domain of the universe, a covariant Lagrangian of a test body moving in the cosmological gravitational field is derived. <b>Inertial</b> <b>forces</b> are determined from a test body’s Euler-Lagrange equation, in Newtonian approximation. The model calculation indicates, that the <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> meet exactly the ones observed in ES universe and Mach’s principle holds there.

30|$|Reynolds {{number is}} defined as the ratio of the <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> to viscous forces. Viscous forces consist largely of fluid drag along the channel walls while <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> refers to shear forces within the fluid that resist changes in {{direction}} or velocity (Bird et al. 1960; Lauritzen and Martiniussen 2011). The ratio of the <b>inertial</b> <b>forces</b> to viscous forces creates the pressure drop across pipe and the channel-style FCDs placed in the pipe induce pressure drop over a longer interval which creates an advantageous condition where erosion or plugging of the FCD can be avoided (Al-Khelaiwi and Davies 2007; Visosky et al. 2007). However, this device’s dependence on friction to generate the majority of its pressure drop makes it highly sensitive to the viscosity of the flowing fluid.|$|R
