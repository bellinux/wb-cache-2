40|$|BackgroundGastrointestinal (GI) tract {{malignancy}} is {{an important}} cause of chronic iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The present {{study was designed to}} determine the prevalence of IDA and its clinical implications in colorectal cancer patients. MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of 101 patients who were admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital with proven colorectal carcinoma from 2003 − 2005. We reviewed the <b>discharge</b> <b>charts</b> and recorded the following data: gender, age, tumor size, tumor site, tumor stage, clinical symptoms, complete blood counts, serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 with and the other without anemia. Different variables of the 2 groups were compared and analyzed to find out the risk factors of anemia in patients with colorectal cancer. ResultsA total of 101 patients, {{with a mean age of}} 65. 3 years, were enrolled; 56 were male. Their mean hemoglobin was 11. 8 g/dL. Fifty-one patients (51 %) were found to have anemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender, tumor in the right colon (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure), and maximum tumor diameter ≥ 3 cm were risk factors of anemia in patients with colon carcinoma. Serum ferritin had been measured in 25 patients, and low ferritin level (< 40 μg/L) was found in 15 (60 %) of them. CEA and LDH were elevated in 45 % (43 / 95) and 46 % (43 / 93) of patients with colorectal cancer, respectively.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{identifying}} the dominant hydrodynamic sea-intrusion mechanism of brackish karst springs is presented. A karst spring becomes brackish when tubes, which bring the freshwater {{to the spring}} (freshwater discharge), intersect other tubes that come from the sea and bring saltwater to the freshwater tubes (saltwater discharge) when the saltwater pressure at the intersection {{is higher than the}} freshwater pressure. There are two potential seawater intrusion mechanisms. The first one is the difference between the freshwater density and the seawater density, and the second is the venturi effect.

40|$|Sleep {{quality in}} hospitalized Canadian General Internal Medicine {{patients}} {{is not well}} characterized. Our goals were to characterize hospital sleep quality in this population and identify potentially modifiable barriers to good sleep. GIM inpatients at a quaternary centre in Edmonton, Canada completed a survey, including the Verran-Snyder Halpern (VSH) questionnaire, to characterize the previous night's sleep within 48 hours prior to <b>discharge.</b> A <b>chart</b> review was also completed to assess comorbidities, discharge diagnoses, and pharmaceutical sleep aid use. Patients reported significantly worse nighttime sleep duration in hospital compared with home (mean 5. 5 versus 7. 0 hours per night, p < 0. 0001). Sleep quality was poor, {{as measured by the}} VSH disturbance (mean 371), effectiveness (190), and supplementation (115) subscales. Variables independently associated with poorer sleep duration in multivariable regression include prior diagnosis of sleep disorder and multi-patient occupancy rooms. Age, sex, admitting diagnosis, length of stay, frequency of vital checks, and use of sleep pharmaceuticals during the index hospitalization were not associated with sleep duration. The most frequently reported reasons for poor sleep included noise (59 %), nursing interruptions (30 %), uncomfortable beds (18 %), bright lights (16 %), unfamiliar surroundings (14 %), and pain (9 %).

Subjects included 830 cases of first ever ischemic stroke and 907 age, ethnicity and gender-matched controls that were free of ischemic stroke. Study recruitment and data collection occurred in three waves with the initial recruitment for females occurring between 1992 and 1996, and again between 2001 and 2003. Male subjects were recruited between 2003 and 2007. In all three waves, cases were hospitalized with a first cerebral infarction identified by discharge surveillance from one of 59 hospitals in the greater Baltimore-Washington area and direct referral from regional neurologists. The methods for <b>discharge</b> surveillance, <b>chart</b> abstraction, case adjudication, and assignment of probable and possible underlying causes have been previously described elsewhere (MacClellan et al. 2007; MacClellan et al. 2009; MacClellan et al. 2006). Control subjects were subjects with no history of stroke identified by random-digit dialing and were matched to cases by age (within ten years) and geographic region of residence. The first wave of female recruitment included cases ages 15 – 44 years recruited within one year of stroke and was designed with a 1 : 2 case to control ratio. The second wave of female recruitment and the sole wave of male recruitment included cases ages 15 – 49 recruited within three years of stroke and designed with a 1 : 1 case to control ratio.

A secondary objective was to investigate associated demographic and diagnostic variables. Methods: A survey was conducted with a convenience sample of parents of children returning to the PED within 72 hours of <b>discharge.</b> A <b>chart</b> review was also completed for consented survey participants. Recruitment occurred from September 2005 to August 2006 at the Stollery Children&# 39;s Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Results: A total of 264 parents were approached to participate. Overall, 231 surveys were returned and 212 (92 %) charts were reviewed. The overall rate of early return during the study period was 5. 4 %. More than half of parents stated that they returned because their child&# 39;s condition worsened and many parents (66. 7 %) reported feeling stressed. Patients were typically under 6 years of age (67. 4 %), and most frequently diagnosed with infectious diseases (38. 0 %). Patients triaged with the Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) as CTAS 2 (emergent) for initial visits were more likely to be admitted on return, regardless of age (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Variables associated with early returns included young age, diagnosis, triage acuity, and parental stress. Future variable definition should include a deeper exploration of modifiable factors such as parental stress and patient education. These next steps may help direct interventions and resources to address needs in this group and possibly pre-empt the need to return.

40|$|Abstract Background Military {{service in}} Finland is {{compulsory}} for male citizens and annually about 90 % of 19 -year-old men {{enter into the}} service. Approximately 15 % of them are discharged due to medical reasons constituting {{a group of young}} men who are at risk of being marginalised in society. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate predictive associations between medical discharge from the compulsory military service and various intrinsic risk factors, including socio-economic, health, health behavior, and physical fitness outcomes. Methods We followed four successive cohorts of conscripts who formed a representative sample of Finnish young men (18 - 28 years old, median age 19 yrs) for 6 months. To exclude injuries and illnesses originating before the onset of service, conscripts discharged from the service at the medical screenings during the 2 -week run-in period were excluded from the analyses. Data regarding medical <b>discharge</b> were <b>charted</b> from computerised patient records. Predictive associations between medical discharge and intrinsic risk factors were examined using multivariate Cox's proportional hazard models. Results Of 1411 participants, 9. 4 % (n = 133) were discharged prematurely for medical reasons, mainly musculoskeletal (44 %, n = 59) and mental and behavioral (29 %, n = 39) disorders. Low levels of physical fitness assessed with a 12 -min running test (hazard ratio [HR] 3. 3; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 7 - 6. 4), poor school success (HR 4. 6; 95 % CI: 2. 0 - 11. 0), poor self-assessed health (HR 2. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 5. 2), and not belonging to a sports club (HR 4. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 11. 6) were most strongly associated with medical discharge in a graded manner. The present results highlight the need for an improved pre-enlistment examination and provide a new means of identifying young persons with a high risk for discharge. Conclusions The majority of the observed risk factors are modifiable. Thus preventive measures and programs could be implemented. The findings suggest that increasing both aerobic and muscular fitness is a desirable goal in a pre-training program before entering military service. Attention to appropriate waist circumference and strategies addressing psychological well-being may strengthen the preventive program. Optimally the effectiveness of these programs should be tested in randomized controlled intervention studies. </p...|$|R

Methods: Eight hundred twenty-seven participants undergoing elective or emergency obstetric, gynecological, general, orthopaedic, breast or urological surgery in an Australian tertiary hospital were enrolled. Complete follow-up data were available for 811 patients (98. 1 %). Operating room lists were randomly allocated to a 'Mask group' (all non-scrubbed staff wore a mask) or 'No Mask group' (none of the non-scrubbed staff wore masks).

IMPORTANCE: With greater access to health care through health care reform {{it is important to know}} if quality of care for similar complaints differs across clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: Develop and pilot a chart review instrument to measure quality of care for patients presenting with urethritis and vaginitis. METHODS: List of sexually transmitted infection (STI) quality of care measures was reviewed by a panel of five STI experts representing Emergency Department (ED), Obstetrics/Gynecology (Ob/Gyn), Family Medicine (FM), Primary Care (PC) and Infectious Disease. Panel members grouped each measure into “standard” or “exceeds standard of care” in evaluation and management of male patients with penile discharge/dysuria or female patients with vaginal <b>discharge.</b> The <b>chart</b> review instrument was piloted on 50 charts per gender from the STI Clinic and matched charts, by patient presenting complaint, age, gender, and visit date, from PC, FM, ED, and Ob/Gyn (for vaginal discharge) in the same large safety-net hospital in Massachusetts. RESULTS: Twenty-four and 34 final measures in male and female patients, respectively, were selected on plurality of expert panel member’s categorization into “standard of care”. Measures were grouped into 7 clinical domains: history, examination, laboratory testing, additional screening, assessment, treatment, and counseling. Performance on the 7 domains ranged from 3. 16 - 4. 36 on male patients and 3. 17 - 4. 40 on female patients, with the highest scores in the STI Clinic. However, each clinical setting had particular documentation strengths and weaknesses: STI Clinic scored higher on laboratory testing, additional screening, and counseling, but scored lower on examination and assessment; ED scored higher on examination and treatment; PC and FM scored higher on laboratory testing for male patients and on examination and treatment for female patients; Ob/Gyn scored higher on treatment. All sites other than the STI Clinic scored poorly on additional screening and counseling. CONCLUSIONS: An instrument to discern standard of care and identify strengths and weaknesses in specific domains of clinical documentation for patients presenting with STI complaints can be rapidly developed and implemented to evaluate quality of care across care settings. Further research is needed on whether these findings can be integrated into site-specific quality improvement processes and linked to cost analyses. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the numbers of German {{physicians}} choosing to work abroad or leaving the medical profession have been growing. Main reasons for physicians’ dissatisfaction are the current system of monetary and non-monetary incentives during residency and the subsequent workload. The aim {{of this study was to}} monitor the workflow of German obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYN) through an objective, computer-based task analysis. In addition several psycho-social values determining work satisfaction were assessed through a questionnaire. The results of OB/Gyns in Universities and those who work in privat/municipal hospitals were compared. Furthermore the impact of quantified workload on junior physicians’ worksatisfaction was analyzed. This study represents one of the few studies that investigate the effect of hospital ownership on physicians work situation. The findings provide an informative basis to find solutions improving physicians' work at German hospitals. The results revealed severe deficits in residents’ working conditions. Physicians’ role is predominantly administrative and clearly centered around indirect patient care such as writing a <b>discharge</b> letter or <b>charting.</b> Only a short time is spent on direct patient treatment. The workflow turned out to be very chaotic. Physicians must multitask and manage tasks despite frequent interruptions. All of these factors can lead to increased stress at work as residents are pressed for time and forced to work longer working hours. Reorganization of job tasks and administrative duties would be required to decrease medical workload. According to our results the means of work satisfaction did not differ significantly between the different hospital ownership types. There were found significant correlations between work satisfaction and life satisfaction, scope for decision-making, self-efficacy, optimism and satisfaction with the work environment. These findings suggest that physicians' satisfaction depends less on hospital ownership and more on general work-characteristics. The importance of the interplay between psychosocial working conditions and residents’ job satisfaction was demonstrated...|$|R

However, therapeutic interchange may increase risk of medication errors. The objective was to characterize the prevalence and safety of therapeutic interchange. Secondary analysis of a transitions of care study. We included patients over age 64 admitted to a tertiary care hospital between 2009 - 2010 with heart failure, pneumonia, or acute coronary syndrome who were taking a medication in any of six commonly-interchanged classes on admission: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 blockers), hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). There was limited electronic medication reconciliation support available. Main measures were presence and accuracy of therapeutic interchange during hospitalization, and rate of medication reconciliation errors on <b>discharge.</b> We examined <b>charts</b> of 303 patients taking 555 medications at time of admission in the six medication classes of interest. A total of 244 (44. 0 %) of medications were therapeutically interchanged to an approved formulary drug at admission, affecting 64 % of the study patients. Among the therapeutically interchanged drugs, we identified 78 (32. 0 %) suspected medication conversion errors. The discharge medication reconciliation error rate was 11. 5 % among the 244 therapeutically interchanged medications, compared with 4. 2 % among the 311 unchanged medications (relative risk [RR] 2. 75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 45 - 5. 19).

40|$|Abstract Background Kappa is {{commonly}} used when assessing the agreement of conditions with reference standard, but {{has been criticized for}} being highly dependent on the prevalence. To overcome this limitation, a prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) has been developed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate the performance of Kappa and PABAK, and assess the agreement between hospital discharge administrative data and chart review data conditions. Methods The agreement was compared for random sampling, restricted sampling by conditions, and case-control sampling from the four teaching hospitals in Alberta, Canada from ICD 10 administrative data during January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2003. A total of 4, 008 hospital <b>discharge</b> records and <b>chart</b> view, linked for personal unique identifier and admission date, for 32 conditions of random sampling were analyzed. The restricted sample for hypertension, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and case-control sample for those three conditions were extracted from random sample. The prevalence, kappa, PABAK, positive agreement, negative agreement for the condition was compared for each of three samples. Results The prevalence of each condition was highly dependent on the sampling method, and this variation in prevalence had a significant effect on both kappa and PABAK. PABAK values were obviously high for certain conditions with low kappa values. The gap between these two statistical values for the same condition narrowed as the prevalence of the condition approached 50 %. Conclusion Kappa values varied more widely than PABAK values across the 32 conditions. PABAK values should usually not be interpreted as measuring the same agreement as kappa in administrative data, particular for the condition with low prevalence. There is no single statistic measuring agreement that captures the desired information for validity of administrative data. Researchers should report kappa, the prevalence, positive agreement, negative agreement, and the relative frequency in each cell (i. e. a, b, c and d) to enable the reader to judge the validity of administrative data from multiple aspects. </p...|$|R

PATIENTS: A total of 135 patient charts, representing 10 % of the patients discharged from the services between Aug. 1 and Dec. 31, 1993. Three charts were unavailable for review, and 26 were excluded because of patient death, early patient discharge (within 48 hours after admission) or lack of discharge summary; this left 106 summaries for analysis of completeness and 114 (including the charts without a summary) for analysis of efficiency. OUTCOME MEASURES: Completeness: proportion of summaries in which the following information was reported: admission diagnosis, drug allergies, physical examination, significant laboratory tests and results, discharge diagnosis, discharge medications and medical follow-up. Efficiency: time taken to generate the discharge summary and whether the patient's family physician received it. RESULTS: Of the 106 <b>charts</b> with a <b>discharge</b> summary, information was available from the dictation system database for all but one (99. 1 % complete). Information was missing on the admission diagnosis in 34. 0 % (36 / 106) of the summaries, the discharge diagnosis in 25. 5 % (27 / 106) and the discharge medications in 22. 8 % (23 / 101). Of the 268 significant laboratory tests and results noted in the charts 115 (42. 9 %) were not reported in the discharge summary. Of the 94 <b>discharge</b> summaries in <b>charts</b> with the patient's family physician listed on the facesheet, 38 (40. 4 %) were not received by the family physician. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable deficiencies in the completeness of the discharge summaries and {{the efficiency of the}} discharge summary system were found in the participating hospitals. Replication of this study in other settings is indicated, and strategies to improve the process should be pursued...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of surgical site infections (SSI) is considered increasingly {{to be an}} indicator of quality of care. We conducted a study in which daily inspection of the surgical incision was performed by an independent, trained team to monitor the {{incidence of}} SSI using U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions, as a gold-standard measure of care. In the department of surgery, two registration systems for SSI were used routinely by the surgeon: An electronic and a plenary tracking system. The results of the independent team were compared with the outcomes provided by two registration systems for SSI, so as to evaluate the reliability of these systems as a possible alternative for indicating quality of care. Methods: The study was an incidence study conducted from May 2007 to January 2009 that included 1, 000 adult patients scheduled to undergo open abdominal surgery in an academic teaching hospital. Surgical incisions were inspected daily to check for SSI according to definitions of health care-associated infections established by the CDC. Follow-up after discharge was done at the outpatient clinic of the hospital by telephone or letter in combination with patient diaries and reviews of patient <b>charts,</b> <b>discharge</b> letters, electronic files, and reported complications. Univariate and multivariable analyses were done to identify putative risk factors for missing registrations. Results: Of the 1, 000 patients in the study, 33 were not evaluated. Surgical site infections were diagnosed in 26. 8 % of the 967 remaining patients, of which 18. 0 % were superficial incisional infections, 5. 4 % were deep incisional infections, and 3. 4 % were organ/space infections. More than 60 % of SSIs were unreported in either of the department's two tracking systems for such infections. For these two systems, independent major risk factors for missing registrations were (1) the lack of occurrence of an SSI, (2) transplantation surgery, and (3) admission to non-surgical departments. Conclusions: Most SSIs were not tracked with the department's two systems. These systems proved poor alternatives to the gold-standard method of quantifying the incidence of Surgical Site Infection SSI and, therefore, the quality of care. Both protocolized wound assessment and on-site documentation are mandatory for realistic quantification of the incidence of SSI...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Consistent {{under-reporting}} {{of autism}} cases by Indiana physicians to the Indiana Birth Defects and Problems Registry (IBDPR) has made quality autism-related data {{very difficult to}} obtain (Indiana Birth Defects and Problems Registry [IBDPR], 2011). As a result, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) currently also utilizes data from billing information that it receives from hospital discharges. However, such cases must be investigated further because autism is often merely suspected as a possibility in the <b>discharge</b> data. A <b>chart</b> auditor must therefore review the child’s chart {{to determine if the}} condition is confirmed. Meanwhile, the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) has a different diagnostic procedure from physicians for determining whether a student has an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which qualifies him or her for special education. A physician diagnosis of autism does not guarantee that a child will receive special education from public schools. With all of these current complications surrounding autism, announced changes in the definition of autism by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) will likely have effects on both the special education field and the public health field. There is a possibility that children who had previously received special education could cease to maintain their eligibility and may find it difficult to obtain benefits. The IDOE may find it necessary to reevaluate their criteria for determining special education eligibility. Additionally, public health officials may see the definition changes affect the number of autism cases they perceive their populations to have, thus impacting community and policy decisions. This study was performed as an attempt to investigate and compare the sources used by the IBDPR to obtain autism data, and determine whether or not the resulting data creates an accurate depiction of the autistic population of Indiana. It was also performed to speculate whether a stricter definition of autism will result in a higher quality of data for the IBDPR and a more consistent view on the disorder between the ISDH and the IDOE. Perhaps from such consistency and simpler definitions, future recorded data will more closely resemble that of reality, enabling the ISDH to utilize the IBDPR to its full extent. Using current definitions for an exploratory analysis of data from the past five years, a discrepancy clearly exists between the IBDPR and the reality of the population of Indiana...|$|R
