5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit {{a large proportion of}} maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> live farther from the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E
5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have been treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have {{an increased risk of}} recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, {{and who have}} persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used {{for people who have}} trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} {{may also}} occur <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{have had a}} head injury. Symptoms may include headache, decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis (weakness of {{one side of the}} body). SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury, and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The annual age-adjusted {{incidence}} rate (AAIR) of PSP {{is thought to}} be three to six times as high in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have never smoked. These cases are often caused {{by a combination of}} genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have no underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is uncommon <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> smoke, {{and there}} is also a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found <b>in</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. <b>In</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> develop acute liver {{failure or}} who are {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
