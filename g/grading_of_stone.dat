The variation of the ratio of the bonded and free water has been revealed under the action of the electrolytes with the simultaneous dispergation of the galvanic settlings. It has been established, that the settlings facilitate the intensification of the process of sintering of the clayish minerals and improvement of the physico-mechanical properties of the ceramics.

5000|$|In {{the example}} below, a short scythe blade, {{being used to}} clear brambles, is being sharpened. Before going to the forest the blade is peened back in the workshop, this reforms the {{malleable}} steel to create an edge profile that can then be honed. Peening is done only occasionally, how often depends on the hardness of the steel {{and the nature of}} the work. The Austrian blade shown is being used to cut tough-stemmed brambles and it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge can usually be worked out of the blade by peening and a new edge profile formed for honing. A peening jig is being used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles; a coarse angle is set first about 3mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed. The blade is then honed using progressively finer honing stones and then taken to the field. In the field the blade is honed using a fine, ovoid whetstone (or rubber), fine-grained for grass, coarser for cereal crops. Honing is done the moment the mower senses that the edge has gone off, this may be every half hour depending on the conditions. The laminated honing stone shown here has two <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and is carried into the field soaking in a water-filled holster on the belt. A burr is set up on the outside of the blade by stroking the blade on the inside, the burr is then taken off by gently stroking it on the outside. There are a great many opinions, regional traditions and variations on exactly how to do this, some eastern European countries even set up the burr on the inside.|$|R

5000|$|The agger was an {{embankment}} {{that gave}} Roman roads the proper draining base. Basically the agger is a ridge {{that supports the}} road surface. The agger was constructed by excavating {{the line of the}} road, building a firm foundation, refilling and compressing the soil, adding more soil from digging drainage ditches or fosses on one or both sides of the road, then surfacing with <b>graded</b> layers <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and cobbles. The material used to build the aggers was dug from lateral ditches. Once the material was dug out of the ditches that were known as [...] " [...] scoop ditches," [...] they were used as the storm drain for that road. These ditches could also be used for soldiers to hide in if they ever were under attack from enemies. On the most important road routes, the agger could be 4 to 5 feet high and 45 to 50 feet wide. Along less important routes the road is occasionally set directly on the levelled ground surface with stones laid to provide drainage with the lateral ditches barely visible. The material was usually found locally, though the Romans would not hesitate to bring in the material from other places if they could find no suitable <b>stone.</b> The course <b>of</b> a Roman road can often be traced today by the distinctive line of the agger across the landscape.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the stone-free rates and intra- and postoperative complication rates and <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> ureterorenoscopic <b>stone</b> treatment {{in patients with}} a solitary kidney. Methods: This study is a subanalysis of the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society (CROES) ureterorenoscopy (URS) study, which is a prospective international multicenter observational study. Over a 1 -year period, consecutive patients treated with ureterorenoscopy for urinary stones were included. Patients entered in this analysis were those with a solitary functioning kidney. Descriptive data on patient characteristics, stone-free rates, complication rates, and grades were evaluated for three separate groups: patients treated with ureteroscopy for ureteral stones, for renal stones, and a combination of renal and ureteral stones. Results: A total of 301 patients were treated for stones in a solitary kidney; 219 were treated for ureteral stones. In this group, the stone-free rate was 88. 6 %, with an intraoperative complication rate of 7. 4 % and postoperative complication rate of 4. 1 %. Totally, 57 patients were treated for renal stones. In this group, the stone-free rate was 56. 4 %, with an intraoperative complication rate of 7. 0 % and postoperative complication rate of 10. 5 %. There were 25 patients who were treated for renal stones in combination with ureter stones. In this group, the stone-free rate was 60. 0 %, with an intraoperative complication rate of 12. 0 % and postoperative complication rate of 10. 5 %. Within the three groups, 72 % of the postoperative complications were classified as Clavien I and II. Conclusions: Ureteroscopy is an effective and safe treatment modality {{for the removal of}} ureteral and renal stones in patients with a solitary kidney. Stone location as well as total stone burden seems to be important factors influencing the ability to render patients stone free. Moreover, single session ureteroscopic stone removal was less effective for the treatment <b>of</b> larger renal <b>stones</b> or renal stones in combination with ureteral stone...|$|R

40|$|Gully erosion in {{the humid}} Ethiopian {{highlands}} intensified in recent decades. The {{study was conducted}} in the Birr watershed located south west of Bahir Dar the capital of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. We studied 14 gullies having similar morphology at three sub watersheds. The watershed covers a total area of 414 ha. The monitoring continued over the 2013 to 2014 monsoon season to better understand the factors controlling gully erosion and the effectiveness of erosion control structures. Perched ground water table was measured at the gully heads and erosion pins were installed to monitor the rate of recession from uncontrolled heads. Though soil properties, ground cover, gully morphology had small contribution for the gully development; water fall effect {{at the head of the}} gully and elevated water table depth at both heads and banks played the key role. Therefore the study focused on reducing the water fall and elevated water table effect by applying two low cost gully control approaches. The first approach was regrading the gully heads and banks at 45 o and the second approach follows regrading the gully heads at 45 o and putting a <b>graded</b> type <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> rip rap. Large stones were anchored at the toe of the head maintaining the stable gully bed slope. The result shows that unprotected gully heads retreat an average of 4 m which is equivalent to 37 m 3 volume of soil loss. The maximum and minimum head cut retreat was between 0 and 22. 5 m. The total area damaged by annual gully head retreat was 240 m 2 and total volume of soil lost was 444 m 3. The treated gully heads did not show any retreat during the monitoring period. Compared with simple reshaping of gully heads, integration with Stone rip rap was an effective and low cost measure in the study watershed. Plantation could not stop the upslope migration of heads though it had the potential to trap sediments down slope. Heads with stone rip rap allows fast re vegetation whereas unprotected reshaped heads and banks took longer time to re vegetate and stabilized. Time of reshaping was important for the stability of banks and heads...|$|R
