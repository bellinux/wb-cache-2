5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who {{made significant contributions to}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity and the Nicene Creed. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen. Since the mid-twentieth century, there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving universal salvation, which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic.

5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E

He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, who differed on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eucharist. Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the Tetrapolitan Confession and the Wittenberg Concord, working closely with Philipp Melanchthon on the latter.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

The Thomist <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unity of form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb {{when she was still}} a virgin.|$|E
