5|$|<b>Heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{east coast}} of the United States soon {{after the start of}} the new year, 1946, Wisconsin transited the Panama Canal from 11–13 January and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 18 January.

After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, Wisconsin sailed for South American waters.|$|E
5|$|Travel {{time from}} Nydalen and Storo {{stations}} {{to the city}} centre stations is about the same, independent of which direction on the Ring Line travellers choose. Passengers <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city centre can therefore take the first train that comes, independent of which direction it is heading, thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five-minute headway service to the city centre. The trains are operated by Sporveien T-banen, a subsidiary of Sporveien, on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.|$|E

5|$|Wainwright again briefly patrolled Hampton Roads before <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> New York Navy Yard on 14April, {{and on to}} Boston, {{where she}} arrived two days later, to prepare for {{overseas}} duty. On 24April, the destroyer departed Boston in company with , , , , and , bound for the British Isles. This division—led by Commander Joseph K. Taussig—was the first American naval unit {{to be sent to}} Europe. The destroyers reached Queenstown on the southern coast of Ireland on 4May and, after fueling, began patrolling the southern approaches to Liverpool and other British ports on the coast of the Irish Sea.|$|E
5|$|While the Luftwaffe was attacking Britain, 36 Bristol Blenheims from RAF Bomber Command {{took off}} in ones and twos to attack a score of German airfields in the Netherlands and France. Its sole success was at Vlissingen, Netherlands, where it damaged two Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) Bf 109s. At the same time four Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys were attacking the Fiat works in Turin, Italy and 20 more were <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{aluminium}} works at Rheinfelden in southern Germany. 18 August 1940 ended before either force reached its target.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork in different directions, with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly changing to two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on its way into the hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (<b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue. Now paralleling Eighteenmile Creek, NY78 intersects with the western terminus of CR105 (Hatter Road). While winding northwest, the route soon enters the hamlet of Newfane.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a sling) and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the Ark heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E

5|$|At 11:30am, March 27, {{recognizing}} {{his description}} from a newspaper story, the engineer and brakeman of a train, from Philadelphia to Jersey City, crossing the Hackensack Bridge, spotted Jackalow running towards the woods. First two, then eight, New Jersey police officers {{went into the}} woods after him. Around noon, Jackalow was turned away from crossing a railroad bridge, then under construction in Newark, New Jersey, by workman William Jacobus, who recognized Jackalow. His colleague Henry Wilson mentioned a $1000 reward for Jackalow's arrest, and the pair—joined by John Sanford and John Douglass, and aided by a spy glass—spotted Jackalow <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Newark Plank Road. Jacobus and Douglass pursued Jackalow, while Wilson and Sanford took the car to Newark, hired a horse, {{and set out to}} intercept him on the road.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 904, a Byzantine renegade in Abbasid service, Leo of Tripoli, led a major naval {{expedition}} of 54 vessels from the Syrian and Egyptian fleets, whose initial target reportedly was Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet penetrated the Dardanelles and sacked Abydos, as the Byzantine navy under the droungarios Eustathios Argyros was reluctant to confront them. Emperor Leo replaced Argyros with the more energetic Himerios, but Leo of Tripoli forestalled the Byzantines, turning back west and <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Empire's second city, Thessalonica, which he sacked after a three-day siege on 31 July 904. The sack of the city brought the Muslim fleet enormous booty and many captives who were taken to be sold as slaves, including the eyewitness John Kaminiates, who wrote the main account of the city's siege and fall.|$|E

In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.|$|E

5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to have jurisdiction in the case.|$|E
5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the Texel to wait for the arrival of the Batavian squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast, <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the Texel, tacking against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> village of Kazus.|$|E
