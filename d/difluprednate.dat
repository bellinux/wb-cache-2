30|$|Corticosteroids are {{a widely}} used topical ocular therapy. They are an {{important}} component of the treatment of diseases in which inflammatory response plays a central role, suppressing cellular infiltration and increasing the synthesis of lipocortins, mainly [6]. <b>Difluprednate,</b> a corticosteroid, mediates its anti-inflammatory effects through the glucocorticoid receptor after intracellular distribution [10]. However, several factors are involved in ophthalmic drug efficacy, diffusion and distribution to targeted ocular tissues are of the most important [11, 12]. Due to its chemical structure, <b>difluprednate</b> ophthalmic emulsion has a high lipophilicity, which facilitates passage through the membranes, allowing a significant distribution to the anterior and posterior segments, unlike early generations of corticosteroids [13], and clinical efficacy in medical settings [14, 15].|$|E

Methods: Drug concentrations of <b>difluprednate</b> emulsion, branded prednisolone acetate suspension (Pred Forte&reg;) and generic prednisolone acetate suspension following three storage conditions (upright, then shaken; upright, not shaken; inverted, not shaken) {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography assay and results were reported as percent of declared concentration. Two drops were dispensed every four hours four times daily. Results: Regardless of bottle orientation and shaking, all <b>difluprednate</b> emulsion concentrations {{at each time point}} analyzed were within 15 % of declared concentration. Both branded and generic prednisolone acetate suspension concentrations varied substantially throughout the study. For the bottle stored upright and not shaken, 46 % of the branded concentrations were not within 15 % of declared concentration; for the bottle stored upright and shaken prior to use, 60 % failed to meet this criterion. None of the branded concentrations from the inverted and not shaken bottle was within 15 % of declared concentration. Generic prednisolone concentrations demonstrated the poorest dose uniformity, with 96 % of the concentrations from the inverted and not shaken bottle not within 15 % of declared concentration; 94 % of the concentrations from the upright and shaken bottle and 87 % from the upright and not shaken bottle similarly failed to meet this criterion.

40|$|Abstract Topical {{corticosteroids}} {{are routinely}} used as postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory drugs; how-ever, adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are observed with their use. While older corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and predniso-lone acetate offer good anti-inflammatory efficacy, clinically {{significant increases in}} IOP (C 10 mmHg) are often associated with their use. Loteprednol eta-bonate, a novel C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid, was retrometabolically designed to offer potent anti-inflammatory efficacy but with decreased impact on IOP. After exerting its therapeutic effects {{on the site of}} action, loteprednol etabonate is rapidly converted to inactive metabolites, resulting in fewer adverse effects. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0. 5 % for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in post-cataract patients with few patients, if any, exhibiting clinically signif-icant increases (C 10 mmHg) in IOP. Furthermore, safety studies demonstrated a minimal effect of loteprednol etabonate on IOP with long-term use or in steroid responders with a much lower propensity to increase IOP relative to prednisolone acetate or dexamethasone. The anti-inflammatory treatment effect of loteprednol etabonate appears to be similar to that of rimexolone and <b>difluprednate</b> with less impact on IOP compared to <b>difluprednate,</b> although confirmatory comparative studies are needed.

30|$|The best-corrected {{vision was}} 20 / 125 {{on the right}} eye and 20 / 25 on the left eye. Intraocular {{pressure}} was normal. No afferent pupillary defect was noted. Anterior segment examination on the right showed several stellate keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium, one cell per high powered field in the anterior chamber, and occasional anterior vitreous cells. Anterior segment examination on the left was unremarkable. Posterior segment examination on the right showed mild to moderate vitreous inflammation, a posterior vitreous detachment, a large area of inactive retinal necrosis (Fig.  1 b), continuous laser barrier scars immediately posterior {{to the area of}} retinitis, and loss of the foveal light reflex suggestive of CME. Posterior segment examination on the left was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography confirmed the presence of severe CME on the right (Fig.  1 c). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging showed marked CME on the right (Fig.  1 d) with a central macular thickness of 743  um. SD-OCT imaging of the left fovea revealed a normal contour with no evidence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid.

This case describes Durezol as a treatment for anterior uveitis unresponsive to prednisolone acetate 1 % (Pred Forte) in a 49 year old African American man. Deviation from the expected/Discussion. While no IOP response was noted to prednisolone, the patient experienced a steroid response from Durezol with an IOP increase to 48 mm Hg and subsequent microcystic edema with only 2 week of use. Steroid efficacy and potential side effects of these medications are discussed. Conclusion. All steroids are prescribed with caution due to their potential side effects.

30|$|A 40 -year-old {{male with}} a history of psoriatic {{arthritis}} presented with blurred vision in both eyes. His visual acuities were 20 / 80 in the right eye and 20 / 70 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 20 and 18, respectively. He had 4 + anterior chamber cell according to SUN criteria [5], fine keratic precipitates, bilateral posterior synechiae, no hypopyon, and normal fundus examinations in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated bilateral disc leakage. Concomitantly, the patient was admitted for dyspnea, leg swelling, and fever and was found to have crescentic cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and pulmonary capillaritis on kidney and lung biopsies, respectively. Cryoprotein was also identified in the serum consisting of two components, an IgG kappa and an IgM kappa, consistent with type II cryoglobulinemia. The patient had negative hepatitis C serologies, was negative for syphilis and HLA-B 27, and showed no evidence of tuberculosis on a chest CT scan. An extensive workup for underlying lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases was also negative. The patient had not been treated with any immunosuppressive therapies for his psoriatic arthritis in the past. He received hourly <b>difluprednate</b> drops for 3 weeks for his uveitis as well as concomitant intravenous pulse dose methylprednisolone followed by prednisone (60 mg daily) and oral cyclophosphamide (150 mg daily) for his glomerulonephritis.

Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either bromfenac (n = 10) QD or nepafenac (n = 10) three times daily. Dosing began 3 days before cataract surgery, continuing to day 21 postsurgery. In addition to the investigated nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug regimen, all subjects received antiinfective intraoperative and postoperative standard of care. Subjects were followed at 1 day and 1, 3, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Study visit assessments included best-corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, summed ocular inflammation score (anterior chamber cells and flare grading), intraocular pressure measurement, adverse event recording, and concomitant medication review. Optical coherence tomography was performed at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. Results: Both treatment groups had similar baseline measurements. Outcomes for mean letters read (P = 0. 318), mean change in macular volume (P = 0. 665), and retinal thickness (P = 0. 552) were not statistically different between the groups from baseline through week six, although independently only the bromfenac group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in letters gained from baseline to week six (P = 0. 040). In the same time period, mean macular volume and retinal thickening worsened in the nepafenac group, demonstrating a statistically significant increase (P = 0. 006) at week six for macular volume when compared to baseline.
