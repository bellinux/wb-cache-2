5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror <b>in</b> <b>creating</b> a European civil society.

An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
