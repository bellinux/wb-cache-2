5|$|This <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{apparently}} {{based on}} seals of the mayoralty {{used in the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier's <b>design</b> <b>is</b> largely {{defined by}} the cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal designs. Nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> very useful {{in cases where}} column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> not known. New <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{obtained}} which are suitable for screening experiments. In certain cases, the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> shown to be optimal {{with respect to their}} aliased structure. The aliased structures, of U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs,</b> <b>are</b> calculated and presented in closed form. This fact makes the new approach innovating and enables the construction of <b>designs</b> that <b>are</b> different from the designs constructed in the literature. An extended multiplication theorem and new infinite families of column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> presented using periodic Golay pairs...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{efficient}} and economical response surface <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> constructed using known <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The proposed class of <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> {{a modification of}} the Central Composite Designs, in which the axial points of the traditional central composite <b>design</b> <b>are</b> replaced by some edge points of the hypercube that circumscribes the sphere of zero center and radius a. An algorithm {{for the construction of}} these <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> developed and applied. The constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> suitable for sequential experimentation and have higherD-values than those of known composite designs. The properties of the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> further discussed and evaluated in terms of rotatability, blocking, and D-optimality under the full second-order mode...|$|R
50|$|Costume <b>design</b> <b>was</b> by Theoni V. Aldredge and {{lighting}} <b>design</b> <b>was</b> by Jules Fisher.|$|R
5|$|A {{consequence}} of this <b>design</b> <b>is</b> that the m-derived half section will match a k-type section on one side only. Also, an m-type section of one value of m will not match another m-type section of another value of m except on the sides which offer the Zi of the k-type.|$|E
5|$|A curious {{aspect of}} the {{official}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{the absence of a}} segment of the Tropic of Capricorn, between the national shield and the ecliptic arc.|$|E
5|$|A variant on this <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of}} arrays, whose {{tilt angle}} can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
50|$|The bridge's <b>design</b> <b>was</b> by Glenn Brown, and the {{engineering}} <b>design</b> <b>was</b> by Daniel B. Luten.|$|R
50|$|The bullpen area <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> {{after many}} {{write-in}} <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> {{submitted by the}} public. Its unique two-tiered <b>design</b> <b>was</b> a first in major league parks.|$|R
40|$|A-optimality of block {{designs for}} control versus test {{comparisons}} in diallel crosses is investigated. A sufficient condition for <b>designs</b> to <b>be</b> A-optimal is derived. Type S 0 <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> defined and A-optimal type S 0 <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> characterized. A lower {{bound to the}} A-efficiency of type S 0 <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> also given. Using the lower bound to A-efficiency, type S 0 <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> shown to yield efficient designs for test versus control comparisons. Diallel cross, type S design, A-optimality, A-efficiency,...|$|R
5|$|Antibiotic drug <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{facilitated}} when {{an enzyme}} {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} {{described in this}} letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, this <b>design</b> <b>is</b> considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, {{there is reason to believe}} that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's <b>design</b> <b>is</b> also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Flames {{introduced}} a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform. The newest <b>design</b> <b>is</b> Western-inspired, with a script Calgary in black {{across the front of}} the jersey, and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear. This uniform was used until the 2015–16 season, after which the throwback third uniforms used from 2010 to 2013 were revived anew.|$|E
40|$|A robust {{process is}} a process that is {{insensitive}} to changes in uncontrollable variables. In this article a class of <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> used to achieve a robust process is proposed. These new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> similar in structure to classical central composite <b>designs,</b> but they <b>are</b> of mixed resolution. That <b>is,</b> the new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> at least Resolution V among the signal factors and are at least Resolution I 11 among the noise factors. A catalog of the new designs, known as composite mixed-resolution (CMR) <b>designs,</b> <b>is</b> included for the practitioner. A comparison of the sizes of robustness designs shows that many CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> superior to or competitive with the corresponding Taguchi designs. The response surface models associated with these two classes of robustness <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> also compared. D efficiencies and G efficiencies of the CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R
500|$|The [...] {{was ordered}} as the lone battlecruiser of the 1908–9 programme. Her outline <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared}} in March 1908, {{and the final}} <b>design</b> <b>was</b> approved in November 1908. This <b>design</b> <b>was</b> essentially an enlarged [...] with revised arrangements of protection and main armament.|$|R
50|$|<b>Designs</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} by {{specialised}} consultants and those were divided among company itself and outsourced consultants. Powerhouse structural <b>design</b> <b>was</b> done by Stems Consultants (Pte) Ltd. Hydraulic and Hydropower specialised <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> done {{by a team of}} specialists namely, G.G. Jayawardhana, P.S.P.S. De Saram and A. K. Dheerasinghe. Other structural <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> outsourced and done by individual structural designers. The architectural design of the powerhouse was done by Pan Arch (Pvt) Ltd.|$|R
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} navigates {{a series of}} {{two-dimensional}} planes with an aquatic microorganism that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's <b>design</b> <b>is</b> based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{market and}} brand focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand {{as the core}} for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The <b>design</b> <b>is</b> driven by the brand vision and strategy.|$|E
5000|$|Subtractive {{polarity}} transformer <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{shown in}} the upper circuit diagrams. Additive polarity transformer <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{shown in the}} lower circuit diagrams.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, the <b>design</b> <b>was</b> modified, {{adding a}} hole in the center due to {{complaints}} that the <b>design</b> <b>was</b> confusing with the 100 yen coin, and changing the reverse side to show a chrysanthemum viewed from above. The metallurgy remained unchanged. This <b>design</b> <b>was</b> issued every year from 1959 to 1966.|$|R
50|$|The musical {{opened on}} Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on February 6, 1969, and closed on May 31, 1969 after 132 {{performances}} and 45 previews. Directed and choreographed by Joe Layton, Scenic <b>Design</b> <b>was</b> by Oliver Smith, Costume <b>Design</b> <b>was</b> by Freddy Wittop and Lighting <b>Design</b> <b>was</b> by Jean Rosenthal.|$|R
5|$|Interior <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} by Gensler. There are six changing rooms. Home team changing rooms occupy , with jacuzzis, cryotherapy {{and a private}} area for the coach. The warm-up area has seating for 86 VIP ticket holders, and is separated by soundproof glass. All the public areas have air conditioning and are finished in marble, granite or top tier ceramic tile.|$|E
5|$|Leavelle's <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he {{appeared}} when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald {{was shot by}} Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is {{a reference to the}} grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973).|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This <b>design</b> <b>is</b> used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the George Cockshott <b>design,</b> there <b>was</b> a {{suggestion}} in 1920 that the Cockshott <b>design</b> <b>be</b> replaced by a (superior?) design by Frank Morgan Giles, who suggested that his <b>design</b> <b>was</b> superior to the design created by Cockshott who was a mere amateur. Morgan Giles persuaded the British that his <b>design</b> <b>was</b> superior, but he was unable to convince the Dutch or Italians.|$|R
50|$|Adaptive <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> used in {{clinical}} trials, and optimal adaptive <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> surveyed in the Handbook of Experimental Designs chapter by Shelemyahu Zacks.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent bicycle designs {{date back}} {{to the middle of the}} 19th century. Several <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> {{patented}} around 1900, but these early <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful.|$|R
5|$|More {{recent works}} have {{improved}} {{sections of the}} highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange. The <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a diamond interchange, with free-flowing traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, {{the state}} {{government}} has been committed to constructing and upgrading the Perth Bunbury Highway, a route along coastal roads, including Old Coast Road south of Mandurah. The ultimate <b>design</b> <b>is</b> for a freeway or expressway-standard road, but with staged construction initially providing a dual carriageway.|$|E
5|$|The David Dillon and Michael Patrick Sullivan (of OWP) <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} {{original}} drawings by Bennett {{found in the}} Chicago Park District's archive.|$|E
50|$|Even though Hiro and Tadashi Hamada {{are portrayed}} as Japanese {{characters}} in the film, his original Korean-based character <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> still prominent within the film. In fact, Tadashi Hamada's character <b>design</b> <b>was</b> influenced by Daniel Henney, his Korean-Irish-American voice actor. GoGo Tomago's <b>design</b> <b>was</b> also influenced by her Korean-American voice actress, Jamie Chung.|$|R
40|$|A-optimality of diallel cross {{experiments}} {{for comparing}} {{two or three}} test lines with a control line under the model for block <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> studied.

40|$|Neighbor {{balanced}} <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{more useful}} to remove the neighbor effects in experiments where {{the performance of a}} treatment is affected by the treatments applied to its adjacent plots. These designs ensure that treatment comparisons will be less affected by neighbor effects as possible. In literature, these <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> available in circular blocks of size 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. In this article, neighbor balanced <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> constructed in circular binary blocks of size ten. A catalog of these <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> also compiled...|$|R
