The Nitrate component is the Oxidizing agent, Sulfur is a low melting Reducing agent and serves {{to aid in the}} transfer of heat through the gunpowder mass, and Carbon is a reducing component producing hot, high pressure gas. The utility of gunpowder lies in its ability to accelerate a projectile by the explosive <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> The development of new explosive materials in the 19th century naturally led to improvements in the rate and magnitude of pressure rise as well as new means for ignition of the charge.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to {{an annual}} growth of {{revenues}} from local taxes and quick privatization of the municipal property, the community was able to finance several large-scale investment projects.

50|$|During {{the primary}} {{recovery}} stage, reservoir drive {{comes from a}} number of natural mechanisms. These include: natural water displacing oil downward into the well, expansion of the natural gas {{at the top of the}} reservoir, <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> initially dissolved in the crude oil, and gravity drainage resulting from the movement of oil within the reservoir from the upper to the lower parts where the wells are located. Recovery factor during the primary recovery stage is typically 5-15%.|$|E
50|$|NSLP {{continued}} to produce gas exclusively from Nova Scotia-mined coal, opening a new gas plant on Lower Water Street in 1917. The final <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> operations occurred in 1942, and in 1948 the system added its last major customer, supplying gas {{to the new}} Victoria General Hospital in Halifax. In the post-war period, gas production remained mostly steady between 190 and 200 million cubic feet per year, but rising coal and labour costs made the operation only marginally profitable. Efforts to sell the division failed. The gas system was abandoned in 1953 and all gas lines under Halifax streets were purged.|$|E
50|$|Gay-Lussac's law {{can refer}} to several discoveries made by French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) and other {{scientists}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries pertaining to thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasses</b> {{and the relationship between}} temperature, volume, and pressure.|$|R

50|$|Decompression (altitude) {{refers to}} the {{reduction}} in ambient pressure due to ascent above sea level. Decompression has physical effects on gas filled spaces and on liquids, particularly when they contain dissolved gases. Physiological effects of decompression are due to these physical effects and the consequential effects on the living tissues, mostly {{as a result of}} the formation and growth of bubbles, and the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> filled spaces.Formation and growth of bubbles due to reduced pressure can be due to reduction in solubility as described by Henry's Law, nucleation and growth of bubbles in supersaturated liquids and boiling of liquids when the pressure is reduced below the vapour pressure for the temperature of the liquid.|$|E
50|$|The drop in {{interest}} rates caused CD investors to pull their money back out of CDs and start looking for new high-yield instruments. It is not really clear how these former CD investors and the institutional property buyers found each other, {{but it seems that}} some petroleum-industry corporations based in Houston, Texas, ailing from the oil crisis, yet wanting to take advantage of low real estate prices for the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> station networks, could no longer qualify as easily for bank financing as they could {{in the early part of}} the decade. Wealthy CD investors in the same area, no longer able to achieve high yields from banks, may have found a solution to both their needs and those of their oil-industry counterparts by inventing the clap note.|$|E
50|$|In another {{department}} of physical chemistry, he investigated the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> liquids with heat, and devised a formula similar to Gay-Lussac's {{law of the}} uniformity <b>of</b> the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases,</b> while in 1861 he anticipated Thomas Andrews' conception of the critical temperature <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> by defining the absolute boiling-point of a substance as the temperature at which cohesion and heat of vaporization become equal to zero and the liquid changes to vapor, irrespective of the pressure and volume.|$|R
50|$|A {{gun barrel}} {{is a part}} of {{firearms}} and artillery pieces. It is the straight shooting tube, usually made of rigid high-strength metal, through which a deflagration or rapid <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> are released in order to propel a projectile out of the end at a high velocity. The hollow interior of the barrel is called the bore.|$|R

50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is a motor that is powered by the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> which is created by the combustion of hydrocarbon gases fuels. To elaborate, an {{internal combustion}} used {{the heat of a}} combustion created by the injected hydrocarbon fuel to create mechanical motion. At the time of the early 1900s, wood alcohol was a popular fuel for French and German automobiles, but as governments imposed large taxes on the production, the price of wood alcohol raised above that of gasoline. Gasoline engines became popular as a result of this, as {{internal combustion engine}}s were commonly known as gasoline engines. Although gasoline engines became popular, they were not particularly desirable due to the dangers of fuel leaks that may cause explosions. Therefore, many inventors attempted to create a kerosene burning engine as a result. This was not a successful venture applying it for automotive usage. There are many different types of fuels for internal combustion engines. These include diesel, gasoline, and ethanol.|$|E
5000|$|With both air {{and fuel}} {{in a closed}} cylinder, {{compressing}} the mixture too much poses the danger of auto-ignition — or behaving like a diesel engine. Because {{of the difference in}} burn rates between the two different fuels, petrol engines are mechanically designed with different timing than diesels, so to auto-ignite a petrol engine causes the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> inside the cylinder to reach its greatest point before the cylinder has reached the [...] "top dead center" [...] (T.D.C) position. Spark plugs are typically set statically or at idle at a minimum of 10 degrees or so of crankshaft rotation before the piston reaches T.D.C, but at much higher values at higher engine speeds to allow time for the fuel-air charge to substantially complete combustion before too much expansion has occurred - gas expansion occurring with the piston moving down in the power stroke. Higher octane petrol burns slower, therefore it has a lower propensity to auto-ignite and its rate of expansion is lower. Thus, engines designed to run high-octane fuel exclusively can achieve higher compression ratios.|$|E
40|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{results from}} gas {{coming out of}} solution in the bodily fluids and tissues when a diver ascends too quickly.

50|$|Molten rock (either magma or lava) {{near the}} {{atmosphere}} releases high-temperature volcanic gas (>400 °C). In explosive volcanic eruptions, sudden release <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> from magma may cause rapid {{movements of the}} molten rock. When the magma encounters water, seawater, lake water or groundwater, it can be rapidly fragmented. The rapid <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> is the driving mechanism of most explosive volcanic eruptions. However, a significant portion <b>of</b> volcanic <b>gas</b> release occurs during quasi-continuous quiescent phases of active volcanism.|$|R

5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the rising magma before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> magmatic <b>gas</b> before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken vesicle walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> in the magma as it reaches the surface.|$|R
50|$|Flash {{suppressors}} {{and sound}} suppressors {{are the most}} obvious devices that operate in the transitional ballistics realm.
