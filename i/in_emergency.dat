5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine are {{not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
40|$|Clean water {{provision}} {{is a critical}} component of emergency response, and chlorination is widely used <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> to treat water. To provide responders with practical, evidence-based recommendations for implementing chlorination programmes and recommend areas for future research, we conducted a literature review of chlorination <b>in</b> <b>emergencies,</b> supplemented with a literature review on chlorination in general. We identified 106 total documents, including 7 with information on technical efficacy, 26 on chlorine dosage, 22 on technical challenges, 21 on product options, 8 on user acceptability, 33 on programmes for emergencies, and 8 on monitoring. We found that: 1) international chlorine dosage recommendations <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> are highly inconsistent; 2) high-quality information from the general chlorination literature on challenges of chlorination can be adapted for emergencies; 3) many chlorine products are available for use in point-of-delivery, point-of-source, and point-of-use emergency-response programmes; 4) information on the effectiveness of different chlorination programmes <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> varies, ranging from little data available to high-quality data that can inform programming; 5) information on user acceptability of chlorination <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> is lacking; and 6) monitoring data on chlorine programme effectiveness <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> are lacking. <b>In</b> this manuscript, we provide a summary of knowledge on chlorination <b>in</b> <b>emergencies,</b> recommendations for programme implementation, and recommendations for future research needed to assist communities and agencies responding to the increasing number of natural disasters and outbreaks worldwide...|$|R

5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine.

The book highlights the latest research results in an integrated and systematic way, and the methodology presented is oriented on real-world problems, allowing it to be used not only directly in railway operational management, but also as the point of departure for further applications or theoretical research. As such, the book will be of considerable interest to graduate students and researchers in the field of traffic and transportation engineering. >...|$|R
