2500|$|In 1908, the Austrian {{physicist}} Ottokar Tumlirz described {{careful and}} effective experiments that demonstrated {{the effect of}} the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture. The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal Nature, which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a [...] tank with [...] of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, [...] "about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42Â° North (the experiment's location)". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet. Automatic transmissions in vehicles frequently have a magnet in the fluid pan to sequester magnetic particles and prolong the life of the media-type fluid filter. Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or magnetic <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|R

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the evaluation of}} some configurations of pavement subsurface drainage systems, including the conventional edgedrain system, and two centerline configurations, at 2 -foot and 4 -foot depths. Testing of these configurations took place on a newly constructed eight-mile section of Nobles County CSAH 35 near Worthington. Drained roadway sections were 500 feet long for each drainage treatment. Each of the treatments was replicated six times, with the outflow for each replication outlet through a tipping-bucket flow monitoring system. The experimental design tested both the drain configuration {{and the effect of}} relative elevation of the roadway. Measurement of relative wetness of the pavement base and subgrade materials for each of the drainage treatments was conducted with a Geonics electromagnetic induction instrument (EM 38). Data were collected from March 2006 until November 2008, with breaks during the winter periods. Statistical analyses were conducted to look for treatment effects, using both drained volumes as well as the EM 38 measurements as measures of drain efficacy.

The steaming chamber is directly below the soaking chamber and it is provided with two <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> to <b>drain</b> water off from the paddy mass and the steaming chamber. A rotating grid is incorporated to serve as a stirrer. The parboiler is mounted on a titling frame for ease of evacuation of the paddy after parboiling. Firewood was used as the source of fuel. The evaluation of the parboiler was done using 50 kg of the long grain rice (SIPPI). The performance of the developed parboiler was compared with the traditional method of parboiling using empty drums and the industrial method. A water uptake test was carried out for the products of the developed parboiler, traditional and industrial methods. Panel subjective test was used to compare the quality of the rice parboiled with the developed parboiler, the traditional and industrial parboiler. The developed parboiler, parboiled 50 kg of rice in 30 mins. The quantity of fuel (firewood) used in parboiling was 3. 6 kg at a parboiling temperature of 950 C. The traditional parboiler parboiled 50 kg of rice in 3 hours and the quantity of fuel (firewood) used in parboiling was 9. 8 kg at a temperature of 105 0 C. Panelsâ assessment showed that the quality of rice produced by the developed parboiler is good when compared to the traditional and industrial methods of parboiling. Overall results show a significant improvement, less time of operation and a cheaper cost using the developed parboiler. A 0. 05 significant level used to test the null hypothesis concluded that there is no significant difference in the water uptake of the rice parboiled using the developed, industrial and traditional parboilers at varying temperatures.

40|$|A {{cooldown}} of {{the inner}} vessel of the Central Calorimeter cryostat to 77 K was performed {{during the week of}} October 12 in order to 'cold shock' it, i. e., to check for insulating vacuum integrity with the inner vessel cold. The conclusion from our test results is that the vessel withstood the cold shock, and the insulating vacuum remained good. Cooldown was analyzed by J. D. Fuerst in D 0 note 3740. 000 -EN- 107, dated August 19. Warmup was analyzed by T. Peterson and B. Fitzpatrick in D 0 Engineering Note 3740. 214 -EN- 110, dated September 29. Both cooldown and warmup times were in accordance with predictions. An initial pumpdown of the insulating vacuum space was done with the vessel warm on October 9. The results of that pumpdown are shown in Figure 1 superimposed on a predicted pumpdown curve generated by Brian Fitzpatrick before the test began. After 24 hours the insulating vacuum was 7 microns. After 48 and 72 hours it was 2 - 3 microns. At this point (October 12) valving the pumps off resulted in a rise of 6 microns in 3 hours and 20 minutes, or 1. 8 microns per hour. Before beginning cooldown, the pumps were valved off and the insulating vacuum was 15 microns. Cooldown and fill began at 0900 on Tuesday, October 13. At 1650, about 8 hours later, LN{sub 2 } flow to the cryostat was shut off. A total of 2600 gallons was consumed during this period based on my readings of the trailer liquid level gauge and chart. An additional 500 gallons was used (according to the same liquid level gauge) in the final blowdown of pressure in the trailer, bringing the total to 3100 gallons. Based on weight in and weight out, 21980 pounds of LN{sub 2 } was used, or 3273 gallons of liquid. This is good enough agreement with my readings of the gauge that I will use the 2600 gallon number as our usage in the cryostat; therefore, the average flow rate for 8 hours was 325 gallons per hour or 5. 42 gallons per minute. At the end we had 1600 gallons of stored liquid in the cryostat, so 1000 gallons were consumed in cooling it down. At this time with the pumps still valved off the insulating vacuum was 13 microns. The vacuum had improved slightly while the pumps had been valved out for the entire time; no cold leakage was observed. Over the next 64 hours while draining and warmup were completed the pumps remained valved out and the vacuum rose to 170 microns, a rate of 2. 5 microns per hour, not significantly different from the 1. 8 microns per hour before the cooldown test. Except for the period of time when the <b>drain</b> was <b>plugged</b> with ice, the rate of warmup agreed very well with predicted rate. Figure 2 shows the warmup of 4 resistors in the gas space and one on the top {{of the inner}} vessel in the vacuum space. The insulating vacuum remained good during the cold shock, and the rate of rise after cold shock was similar to that before. The rate of warmup was in good agreement with predictions, indicating that predicted heat transfer coefficents inside the vessel were reasonably accurate (within 50 % of actual) ...|$|R
