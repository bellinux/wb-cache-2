5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical <b>fibers.</b> When optic <b>fibers</b> are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode <b>fibers</b> and single-mode <b>fibers.</b> Multimode <b>fibers</b> {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical <b>fibers</b> that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E

Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy <b>fibers</b> and climbing <b>fibers</b> (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel <b>fibers</b> (which are the axons of granule cells). There are two main pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy <b>fibers</b> and climbing <b>fibers,</b> both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of short <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites depend critically on the <b>fiber</b> length distribution (FLD) and the <b>fiber</b> orientation distribution (FOD). In particular, {{the strength of}} short <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites increases {{with the increase of}} the mean <b>fiber</b> length and with the decrease of the mean <b>fiber</b> orientation angle (angle between the <b>fiber</b> axis and the loading direction).The elastic modulus (E) of misaligned short <b>fiber</b> reinforced polymer composites depends on the distributions of <b>fiber</b> lengths and orientations within the composite structure. In general, the composite elastic modulus increases with the decrease of the mean <b>fiber</b> orientation angle and with the increase of the <b>fiber</b> orientation coefficient; and the elastic modulus increases with the increase of mean <b>fiber</b> length when the mean <b>fiber</b> length is small. When the mean <b>fiber</b> length is large, it has nearly no influence on the elastic modulus of short <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites.|$|R

5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent <b>fibers</b> via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The <b>fibers</b> arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine <b>fibers</b> to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent <b>fibers</b> are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent <b>fibers</b> from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent <b>fibers</b> to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compressive}} {{response of}} polymer matrix <b>fiber</b> reinforced unidirectional composites (PMC’s) is in-vestigated via {{a combination of}} experiment and analysis. The study accounts for the nonlinear constitutive response of the polymer matrix material and examines the effect of <b>fiber</b> geometric imperfections, <b>fiber</b> mechanical prop-erties and <b>fiber</b> volume fraction on the measured compressive strength and compressive failure mechanism. Glass and carbon <b>fiber</b> reinforced unidirectional composite specimens are manufactured in-house with <b>fiber</b> volume fractions ranging over 10 60 percent. Compression test results with these specimens show that carbon <b>fiber</b> composites have lower compressive strengths than glass <b>fiber</b> composites. Glass <b>fiber</b> composites demonstrate a splitting failure mode {{for a range of}} low <b>fiber</b> volume fractions and a simultaneous splitting/kink banding failure mode for high <b>fiber</b> volume fractions. Carbon <b>fiber</b> composites show kink banding throughout the range of <b>fiber</b> volume fractions examined. Nonlinear material properties of the matrix, orthotropic material properties of the carbon <b>fiber,</b> initial geometric <b>fiber</b> imperfections and nonuniform <b>fiber</b> volume fraction are all included in an appropriate finite element analysis to explain some of the observed experimental results. A new analytical model prediction of the splitting failure mode shows that this failure mode is favorable for glass <b>fiber</b> composites, which is in agreement with test results. Furthermore, this model is able to show the influence of <b>fiber</b> mechanical properties, <b>fiber</b> volume fraction and <b>fiber</b> geometry on the splitting failure mode...|$|R

Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells.
