McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces {{the reader to}} quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem {{to have found a}} home on page eleven.|$|E

He had been twice mentioned in despatches during the war, received the Queen's South Africa Medal, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put a damper on Duquesne's hopes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E

On 29 April, he was included in Real Madrid's matchday squad for the first time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> La Liga fixture against UD Almería, as Ancelotti was without Gareth Bale, Luka Modrić and Karim Benzema through injury.

The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's 1950–51 {{season was}} {{similarly}} unproductive, with the Test players back in Australia <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> series against England. He was only {{selected for the}} two first class matches against Tasmania, was even less successful. In the first match, he made a duck in the first innings, {{before coming to the}} crease {{at the end of the}} run-chase and being yet to score as a nine wicket win was completed. In the next match he made 0 and 9, as Victoria scraped home for a nine run win, despite Harvey conceding 20 runs from four wicketless overs. He ended the first class season with 9 runs at 3.00. In a Second XI fixture against New South Wales, he made 61 before being bowled by Alan Davidson. In the first innings he delivered one over and was attacked heavily, conceding 23 runs. In the second innings, he bowled 13 overs and took 1/49 as New South Wales ended 24 runs short of making Victoria bat again with three wickets in hand when the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved to be quite a different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> economics program.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 2007, at a {{game against}} the New York Islanders, the Penguins tied a {{franchise}} record with 30 straight regular-season sellouts, dating to {{the second half of the}} 2006–07 season. The record was surpassed at the next home game against the Boston Bruins on December 23, with the 31stconsecutive sellout of the regular season. On March 12, against the Buffalo Sabres, with a standing-room-only crowd of 17,132, the Penguins set a franchise record after selling out all 35 games to date, surpassing the record set during the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons when the Penguins sold out 34 of 40 home games. For the first time in the franchise's 41-year history, the team sold out all 41home games, concluding with their Atlantic Division-clinching victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on April 2. At 17,089, the average attendance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> game was greater than Mellon Arena's seating capacity of 16,940, causing the team's season attendance to exceed 100% capacity. The 67consecutive sellouts attracted 888,653total fans, a record for home attendance for the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back in {{the lineup}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new {{starting}} lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back. With less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. One quick possession by each team left it 67–69 {{in favor of the}} Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.|$|E
