The car won every race in which it competed during that first season of Formula One; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> that a car which had originated in 1938 was so victorious, most likely because all the other constructors (as few as there were) had less money to build and develop their cars and the Alfa had so much development time. The Alfa Romeo team included talented drivers such as Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio, the latter of whom later won the World Drivers' Championship five times.|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

500|$|Enhanced by the {{considerable}} influence of Leicester's Commonwealth, the rumours about Amy Robsart's death {{developed into a}} tradition of embellished folklore. As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall {{from a pair of}} stairs as an easy {{way to get rid of}} one's wife: [...] "A politician did it." [...] In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, Kenilworth, by Walter Scott. The novel's arch-villain is again called Varney. The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester's wretchedness, he concluded in 1863: [...] "she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far." [...] There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885: here she was first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye's main sources were Cecil's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley's death and, again, Leicester's Commonwealth. Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation. By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart's death caused suspicion was [...] "as natural as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth's or even Dudley's would have perceived that murder would make the marriage impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr R. Nagulendran, a {{consultant}} psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by reactive psychotic depression. [...] According to {{him she was}} depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. [...] Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. [...] Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. [...] A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. [...] Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. [...] Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes. [...] Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery. [...] However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse {{during the time of}} the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16July 1980 [...] 31January 1981). If Hoe had been as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. [...] Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. [...] Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits".

Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible,</b> and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable and popular early storylines {{involving}} Grant was a love triangle between him, his brother and his wife Sharon (played by Letitia Dean). Despite the fact that Sharon married Grant initially, EastEnders writer Tony Jordan has revealed in The Mitchells - The Full Story that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers came to the realisation that Sharon was perfect for them both. This storyline was slow burning and was spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 {{in one of the}} soap's notorious three-handers. Sue Dunderdale directed the episodes and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama. Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of EastEnders most popular and renowned episodes, which have been dubbed [...] "Sharongate". The episodes — which were watched by 25.3 million viewers — centred around Grant's discovery of the affair and his startling reaction. The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the brothers throughout the 1990s. Writer of Sharongate, Tony Jordan, has stated that of all the storylines he has penned for the soap, Sharongate is the one he is most proud of. He comments [...] "Three of the strongest characters that have ever been in EastEnders are the Mitchell brothers and Sharon... when we actually blew that story <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible...</b> being able to reach that many people with your work is what makes EastEnders exciting." [...] Sharongate has also proven a popular storyline with viewers and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of the decade in a poll of 17,000 people for What's On TV magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Aguilera {{set about}} {{contacting}} collaborators {{on her own}} accord, {{at the behest of}} then-husband Jordan Bratman, without relying on the record label A [...] "Going into , I said, 'I'm a really big fan of yours, and I'm interested in stepping into your world and what you do,'" [...] Aguilera says. [...] "'I want to combine that with my sound, and let's see what happens.' I feel like I can do so much with my voice. I would be so bored sitting on a stool singing ballad after ballad just because I can." [...] Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler and her collaborator Samuel Dixon worked with Aguilera on a number of tracks for the album. Aguilera told Billboard that she is a big fan of Furler and stated that she was thrilled when Furler said that she wanted to work with her as well. They recorded together in the studio in January 2009, and according to Furler's blog the duo wrote four songs together during the sessions. Members of British electronic band Ladytron, Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu, went to Los Angeles to meet Aguilera in December 2008 after hearing that they were one of her favorite bands. During the meeting, Aguilera identified what kind of Ladytron songs she liked, with Hunt later saying, [...] "We were impressed because she had a real deep knowledge of our music – album tracks, not just the singles!". Ladytron said following about the sessions with the singer, [...] "We went in with no expectations; the whole thing was a massive surprise. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> She was so musically talented, a vocalist who really knows her voice. The first takes sounded really amazing, and while we'd made demos, it was only when her voice was on them that it all came to life." [...] They finished the work with Aguilera in March 2009 and produced four or five tracks, but only three songs made the final cut. Two songs produced by Ladytron appeared on the deluxe edition of the album, [...] "Birds of Prey" [...] and [...] "Little Dreamer." [...] Meanwhile, the third track, [...] "Kimono Girl" [...] did not make the final cut, although it has been highly anticipated by fans. British duo Goldfrapp said in a January 2010 interview that they did not finish the studio session and did not know whether their songs would make the final cut.|$|E
