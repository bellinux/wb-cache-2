5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series. During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> have to help it without revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends. This notion was conceived as a 'Sarah Jane-lite' narrative which would allow Elisabeth Sladen a break in production.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal {{had been}} exposed to the {{combined}} French and Spanish fire for four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a signal of <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Holmenkolbanen {{applied to}} build a branch from Frøen via Tåsen to Nydalen and Grefsen, along what is today the Ring Line. This {{proposal}} included a branch to Sognsvann. The Ministry of Labour granted the concession to Akersbanerne, who started construction in January 1922. However, due to a labor conflict, the work was put on hold in 1924. In 1924, the Røa Line (at the time called the Smestad Line) {{was taken over by}} Akersbanerne, but Holmenkolbanen retained the operation. After {{the first part of the}} Common Tunnel, from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret, opened in 1928, Holmenkolbanen was in financial <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> in 1932 Akersbanerne took over the majority of the shares of Holmenkolbanen. At the same time, the Røa and Sognsvann Lines were merged into Holmenkolbanen.|$|E
5|$|Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), {{an open-air}} museum, was opened {{by the local}} {{population}} in 1927. In 1938 it {{was moved to the}} sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.|$|E

5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in <b>distress,</b> <b>and,</b> in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E

5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for herpes and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1934 and the venue opened on 28 June 1936 {{as the first}} home venue for Briskebyen FL. The club merged with Hamar AIL in 1946 to form Ham-Kam. The new club has played since 1970 played 22 seasons in the top tier, having been relegated eight times, most {{recently}} in 2008. Ham-Kam's record home attendance is 11,500, dating from a 1976 match against Lillestrøm. In 1984, the club house was rebuilt with luxury boxes and a new 2,400-seat East Stand was built. The investments lead the club into financial <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> in 1993 the municipality had to purchase the venue to save the club. Planning of a new or upgraded venue started in 2001, construction started in 2007 and the first stage was completed the following year. It cost 111 million Norwegian krone (NOK), having suffered large cost overruns.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In the 17thcentury Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton {{fought on}} both sides, {{although}} more {{men from the}} Fylde were {{on the side of}} the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty that resulted from the wars. In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Some OHP {{research}} {{is concerned with}} (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' {{physical and mental health}} and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis. Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> work-family conflict. Ongoing job insecurity, {{even in the absence of}} job loss, is related to higher levels of depressive symptoms, psychological <b>distress,</b> <b>and</b> worse overall health.|$|E

If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels <b>distress</b> <b>and</b> rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E
