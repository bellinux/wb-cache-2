5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E.

He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> damage standards of living.

Past and future technological developments {{have a variety of}} social, economic and ethical implications which have {{to be taken into account}} when balancing its costs and benefits to society. Departing from an economic perspective we describe a number of mechanisms underlying the emergence of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology which help us to understand some of the characteristics of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology, such as its focus on quality enhancement rather than on economy. To assess the actual performance of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of efficiency and equity is difficult as there may be debate about the perspective guiding such assessment and as there still is scarce information on <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of these economic indicators. The increasing technological opportunities have triggered a wider debate on the desired evolution of our health care systems. In some countries there is a tendency to diminish government involvement in health care and emphasize private (for profit) enterprise as a reaction to not being able to finance all new <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology. The risks of such strategies are discussed briefly. We conclude that the main actors in health care should adjust their behaviour in order to accomplish the introduction of more cost-effective technologies and to achieve a more socially efficient distribution of their benefits. <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology socio-economic implications...|$|R

DESIGN: To locate <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> or long stay patients, the analysis was designed {{on the basis}} of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma. MAIN RESULTS: <b>High</b> <b>cost</b> and long stay factors were the same: number of stays, death, transfer, acute leukaemia, neutropenia, septicaemia, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterisation, parenteral nutrition, protected or laminar airflow room, blood transfusion, and intravenous antibiotherapy.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. A major {{study conducted by}} the Young Foundation and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council investigating the use of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales. The research was carried out throughout 2015 with the final report - Credit where credit’s due? Understanding experiences of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales – published in May 2016. An estimated 12 million people across the UK lack access to affordable credit, something the majority take for granted in everyday life. The alternatives for many are <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> lenders – payday loans, doorstep lenders, or expensive rent-to-own stores on the high street. This financial exclusion is harmful to individuals and families, our communities and the wider economy. Objectives: We set out to understand the scale of the issue, pathways into and journeys through <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit, and the impact this has. We aimed to identify opportunities and offer suggestions for new and improved products, services and ways of engaging consumers – and to outline what might work as alternatives to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit. Key Findings: •	Six per cent of the Welsh population have used one or more of rent-to-own stores, home credit and payday loans in the last year. •	Customers come {{from all walks of life}} but are most likely to be young families. •	Reasons for using <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit range from paying for Christmas or buying new items for the home, to simply paying the bills and making ends meet. For most, these represent essential purchases. •	The majority of people turn straight to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit without considering different types of credit or comparing offers between lenders. •	<b>High</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers are typically extremely aware of their income and outgoings, often using ‘jam jar’ and other informal money management solutions. •	Many see <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit options as being ‘for people like me’ and one of a very limited set of financial options. •	The majority of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers live in communities where these types of borrowing are normal. •	Home credit providers especially are in a strong position to encourage repeat borrowing. •	Customer perceptions of payday loans still firmly reflect the pre-cap market. •	By contrast, rent-to-own and home credit have largely slipped through the net of negative publicity. •	Regulating all forms of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit out of existence is not the answer. •	There is a clear need for market growth in the affordable credit market...|$|R
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> for electricity such as in California and Japan.

By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E

Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (<b>high)</b> <b>costs</b> of signalling.
