5|$|The Middle Level Navigations are {{a network}} of {{waterways}} in England, primarily used for land drainage, which lie in The Fens between the Rivers Nene and Great Ouse, and between the cities of Peterborough and Cambridge. Most of the area through which they run is at or below sea level, and attempts {{to protect it from}} inundation have been carried out since 1480. The Middle Level was given its name by the Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden in 1642, who subsequently constructed several <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> to make the area suitable for agriculture. Water levels were always managed to allow navigation, and Commissioners were established in 1754 to maintain the waterways and collect tolls from commercial traffic.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E

Led by American and Malian Rotary Clubs and Engineers Without Borders (USA) Chapters, the groups surveyed in February 2008 a rainwater <b>drainage</b> <b>channel.</b> The <b>drainage</b> <b>channel,</b> known as a [...] "collecteur de pluies" [...] in French, runs 2 kilometers through the city center. During the rainy season, flooding causes havoc, and {{during the rest of the}} year, the <b>drainage</b> <b>channel</b> becomes a breeding ground for disease. The intent of the project is to minimize both the flooding and the unsanitary stagnant water in the <b>drainage</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|R

IDBs are not responsible for watercourses designated as main rivers within their drainage districts; the supervision of these watercourses is undertaken by the Environment Agency.|$|E

25|$|More recently, the {{organisational}} structure has changed. Henry VIII's Statute of Sewers, dating from 1531, was {{swept away by}} the Land Drainage Act 1930, and responsibility passed through six bodies, ending with the Environment Agency in 1995. Local <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> were managed by an internal drainage board, and again responsibility has changed as the three IDBs managing the area have gradually merged. Steam pumping was replaced by diesel, and subsequently by electric pumps.|$|E
25|$|The Vale of York is drained southwards by the River Ouse and its tributaries, the Ure, the Nidd and the Foss. To {{the east}} of the area the River Derwent drains southwards into the Ouse.

Many of these watercourses are maintained and managed by local internal drainage boards to ensure sustainable water levels are kept across the vale.|$|E

25|$|Dambo’s are grassy <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> and basins {{with little}} to no woody {{vegetation}} but very palatable grasses. Most woody species grow on exposed termitaria as dambo’s tend to retain water very well. Dambo’s are of a vital importance to grazing mammal species {{as well as several}} woodland mammals that choose to graze on the fringes, especially during the dry season. Several large (several square km) grassy plains occur within the park such as Chinyangali close to Fibwe and the Chikufwe plain east of the Luwombwa River.|$|E
25|$|Bioretention systems {{involve the}} {{treatment}} of water by vegetation prior to filtration of sediment and other solids through prescribed media. Vegetation provides biological uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and other soluble or ﬁne particulate contaminants. Bioretention systems offer a smaller footprint than other similar measures (e.g. constructed wetlands) and are commonly used to filter and treat runoff prior to it reaching street drains. Use on larger scales can be complicated and hence other devices may be more appropriate. Biorentention systems comprise bioretention swales (also referred to as grassed swales and <b>drainage</b> <b>channels)</b> and bioretention basins.|$|E

She was open-minded about her suitors, and offered herself to whichever of them could drain the lake which supposedly once occupied the space between Bradford-on-Avon (Wiltshire) and Bristol.

25|$|Hatfield Chase is a low-lying area in South Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, England, {{which was}} often flooded. It was a royal hunting ground until Charles I {{appointed}} the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain it in 1626. The work involved the re-routing of the Rivers Don, Idle and Torne, {{and the construction}} of <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> It was not wholly successful, but changed the whole nature of a wide swathe of land including the Isle of Axholme and caused legal disputes {{for the rest of the}} century. The civil engineer John Smeaton looked at the problem of wintertime flooding in the 1760s, and some remedial work was carried out.|$|E
25|$|Between these low {{ranges of}} hills the Ancholme river runs south to north through its flat, lowlying flood plain, with a northsouth height {{difference}} {{of only a}} few metres. The town sits on alluvial soils of the Ancholme, and the area surrounding the town was previously a semiflooded marsh known as carrs. A series of drainage improvements from the 1630s to the 1820s transformed the whole of the valley into arable land. The largest of the <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> is also a canal known as the New River Ancholme. The original course of the river has been obliterated in places by the drainage works, but its discontinuous surviving length is known as the Old River Ancholme.|$|E

25|$|It {{was once}} widely {{hypothesized}} that ethane produced {{in this fashion}} on Titan rained back onto the moon's surface, and over time had accumulated into hydrocarbon seas or oceans covering much of the moon's surface. Infrared telescopic observations cast significant doubt on this hypothesis, and the Huygens probe, which landed on Titan in 2005, failed to observe any surface liquids, although it did photograph features that could be presently dry <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> In December 2007 the Cassini probe found at least one lake at Titan’s south pole, now called Ontario Lacus because of the lake's similar area to Lake Ontario on Earth (approximately 20,000nbsp&km2).

25|$|In areas {{prone to}} urban flooding, one {{solution}} is the repair {{and expansion of}} man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural <b>drainage</b> <b>channels,</b> porous paving, and wetlands (collectively known as green infrastructure or sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take {{the flow of water}} away from their building and installing rain barrels, sump pumps, and check valves.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven plough for normal ploughing, {{rather than just}} <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> However normal ploughing was much lighter work that could be achieved perfectly well {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven plough was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the plough’s efficiency would be to design a plough that could plough in either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the plough that had two ploughs attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two plough blades would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the plough was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly ready for the next furrow.|$|E
