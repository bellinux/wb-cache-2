500|$|In early 2015, Nintendo {{launched}} its Creator Program, {{in order to}} share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos.

PewDiePie called the program a [...] "slap {{in the face to}} the YouTube channels that [...] focus on Nintendo game exclusively", adding, [...] "The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo's community are the ones left in the dirt the most." [...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on my channel as usual. I'm lucky to be in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are not in that situation."

I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E

After their 2000 World Series appearance the Mets did not make the playoffs again until 2006, where they lost in that NLCS in seven games. Meanwhile, the Reds did not place in the top two of their division until returning to the playoffs in 2010.

Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do.

[...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{did not speak}} from their breakup until 2008. That August, Jerry Finn {{suffered}} a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support. On September 19, Barker and Goldstein {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions.

Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting. Hoppus remembered: [...] "I remember [...] said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Morison handed in {{a written}} {{transfer}} request amid speculation about a move to newly promoted Premier League side Norwich City.

A day later, Morison revealed [...] "Norwich have made a couple of bids that have been turned down so I've done what I've done. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Premier League, I might not get another opportunity". On 2 June 2011, Millwall accepted an offer from Norwich City for Morison after the two clubs agreed a fee for the player, it was the fourth bid Norwich had made for Morison. He signed for the club on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 6 June. Morison made his Norwich City debut against Wigan Athletic during the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, playing 75 minutes of the match in a 1–1 draw. He was crucial in Norwich's equalising goal, beating Adrián López Rodríguez on the right wing and providing a cross that was ultimately turned in by Wes Hoolahan. He scored his first goal for the club in Norwich's first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory against Sunderland on 26 September. The goal came shortly after half-time, with Morison heading in Marc Tierney's cross to give Norwich a two-goal lead. Morison scored his second goal for Norwich in a 3–3 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 29 October, with the goal being described as a [...] "stunning strike" [...] {{from the edge of the}} area. A week later, he scored a header from an acute angle in Norwich's 3–2 away defeat against Aston Villa. Morison's fourth goal of the campaign came in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal on 19 November, scoring the opening goal of the game after he stole the ball from Per Mertesacker before calmly beating Wojciech Szczęsny in the Arsenal goal. He scored his fourth goal in five Premier League appearances on 3 December, beating Gaël Clichy at the back post to powerfully head the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal. Morison's goal was a minor consolation in a 5–1 defeat at the City of Manchester Stadium. Morison was also on target for the Canaries in the club's 4–2 home win over Newcastle United on 10 December, scoring Norwich's third goal when he powerfully headed in Andrew Crofts' cross from 12-yards out. He scored in Norwich's first three games of 2012 despite featuring as a substitute in two of the matches, scoring once in the FA Cup in a 4–1 victory over Burnley, as well as netting late goals in 2–1 away victories against Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion respectively. After his goal at West Brom, Morison did not find the scoresheet for another three months [...] – eventually scoring his tenth goal of the campaign in a 3–3 draw away to Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 5 May 2012. Morison's late strike from a tight angle drew Norwich level after they had trailed 3–2 with five minutes remaining. During his first season at the club, he scored ten goals in 37 appearances.|$|E
