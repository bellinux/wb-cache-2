It was the first election {{according to the new}} Constitution of Hungary which went into force on 1 January 2012. The new electoral law also entered into force that day. The voters elected 199 MPs instead of previous 386 lawmakers. The current political landscape in Hungary is dominated by the conservative Fidesz, who have a near supermajority, and two medium-sized parties, the left-wing <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (MSZP) and nationalist Jobbik.|$|E

25|$|The Round Table {{agreement}} of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered {{an overhaul of}} the Constitution, establishment of a Constitutional Court, the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus). The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system. A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on March 24, 1990. The legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. The Soviet military occupation of Hungary, which had persisted since World War II, ended on 19 June 1991.|$|E

He was convinced that socialism was the answer to Hungary's post-war problems, but not that of Kun's <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> which had close ties to the Soviet Union.

[...] Words have led to actions in some instances, for example when leftist activist Péter Dániel vandalized a rural bust of Horthy by dousing it in red paint and hanging a sign that read [...] "Mass Murderer — War Criminal" [...] around its neck.

[...] Márton Gyöngyösi admitted immediately after his speech that he had composed his sentence wrongly, as he thought of MPs with Israeli-Hungarian double citizenship and not of Jewish people. At the same time Gyöngyösi offered apology for the misunderstanding. Despite this, political rivals of Jobbik started a harsh smear campaign, depicting Gyöngyösi as an extremist.
