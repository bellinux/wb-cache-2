30|$|The {{standard}} deviation is {{expressed as a}} percentage because {{the position of the}} accelerator pedal is expressed in percentage; 0 % is the accelerator fully up and 100 % <b>fully</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} NWA, Steamboat {{underwent}} {{surgery on his}} injured <b>foot.</b> <b>Fully</b> recovered, {{he returned to the}} ring in February 1990 for the North Carolina-based North American Wrestling Association (later renamed South Atlantic Pro Wrestling in July 1990), where he feuded with Robert Fuller over the NAWA/SAPW Heavyweight Championship, until leaving the promotion in October 1990.|$|R
50|$|In late 2006, they headlined the Radio Rebellion Tour {{with support}} from Between the Buried and Me, Fear Before, Misery Signals and The <b>Fully</b> <b>Down.</b> They played the entire Warped Tour {{in the summer of}} 2008.|$|R
50|$|It is {{fitted with}} a frame-mounted, thumb-operated rear-locking safety, which also blocks the slide. This can be applied with the hammer <b>fully</b> <b>down,</b> or cocked. The hammer has a half-cock safety notch. There is an inertia type firing pin design:.|$|R
50|$|In February 2004, while chumming {{the waters}} during a cage-diving expedition, Andre's foot was {{bitten by a}} great white shark as they dangled {{over the edge of}} his boat. The South African {{newspapers}} claimed that Andre was free-diving with the sharks in the chummed water {{at the time of the}} incident, which is illegal in South Africa. The actual sequence of events that took place are disputed. Andre's <b>foot</b> <b>fully</b> recovered.|$|R
50|$|The Ranger 26-2 {{is a small}} {{recreational}} keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a lifting fin keel. It displaces 3000 lb. The boat has a {{draft of}} 4.75 ft with the retractable keel in the <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> position.|$|R
50|$|The only {{difference}} between the full side stroke and sprinter side stroke is instead of bringing the second lead arm <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> {{to the side of}} the body the arm will only half stroke; the arm moves halfway towards the body and is then brought back to the fully extended position.|$|R

50|$|The dwarf panda (Ailuropoda minor) is an extinct panda species. It {{was half}} the size of the modern giant panda, being about three feet in length as opposed to the giant panda, which averages five <b>feet</b> <b>fully</b> grown. The size of the dwarf panda was unknown until 2007 when a skull was {{discovered}} in China. Like its modern counterpart, it lived on bamboo shoots, as indicated by wear patterns recorded on teeth and specialised muscle markings, indicating heavy chewing, on the skull.|$|R
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|R

50|$|In the UK, it is a {{requirement}} that a safety curtain must be <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. In 1794 the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane became the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain. Several other serious fires, notably that at the Theatre Royal, Exeter in 1887, led {{to the introduction of}} safety curtains on a wider scale.|$|R
50|$|The old lift {{was closed}} {{shortly after the}} opening of the new lift. A year later in 1963 an attempt was made to restart the old lift. It was found that the trough had tilted and that it could no longer be moved into either the fully up or <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> positions. The lift remains in this {{condition}} today and is conserved as part of a museum.|$|R
50|$|I Am The Avalanche {{have played}} the Vans' Warped Tour, The Bamboozle Festival, and have also toured with Bleeding Through, Bayside, The Sleeping, No Use for a Name, Halifax, The <b>Fully</b> <b>Down,</b> Senses Fail, The Forecast, Bouncing Souls, The Loved Ones and, most recently, Saves the Day and Brand New, and in October 2008, they headed out on a month-long tour with Four Year Strong and This is Hell.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fully</b> <b>Down</b> Canadian {{rock band}} that {{was formed in}} Ottawa in 1999, with the {{recording}} lineup coming together in 2003. The band debuted in June 2004 on Pop Culture Records with No Fate...But What We Make for Ourselves and they went on three weeks Warped Tour 2004 to support it. Warped Tour gave them their first taste of U.S. exposure, which accelerated their popularity in North America.|$|R
25|$|Some bands mark time by {{bringing}} their feet {{all the way}} up to their knee—known as high-mark time. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a greater sense of marching while actually standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching. Traditionally, the drumline would put their feet in a V-shape and lift their <b>feet</b> <b>fully</b> off the ground a few inches. This is to avoid hitting the drums.|$|R
50|$|A helix {{is a full}} 360 degree trick, {{of which}} 180 of which must be <b>fully</b> upside <b>down</b> and aerial.|$|R
50|$|Peterson {{fired the}} landing rockets to provide {{additional}} lift, but he hit the lake bed before the landing gear was <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> and locked. The M2-F2 rolled over six times, coming to rest upside down. Pulled from the vehicle by Jay King and Joseph Huxman, Peterson {{was rushed to the}} base hospital, transferred to the March Air Force Base Hospital and then the UCLA Hospital. He recovered but lost vision in his right eye due to a staphylococcal infection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{center span}} is lifted by {{the action of}} two large {{concrete}} slabs of slightly greater weight than the lifted span, which block traffic when <b>fully</b> <b>down.</b> They are set in downwards motion to lift the bridge by a very slight action of the motors, as gravity does the rest. Unlike most vertical lift bridges, there are no barrier gates to protect oncoming traffic, just a sign that lights up that says [...] "STOP: BRIDGE OPENING".|$|R
2500|$|Tensions and hazards {{came to a}} head {{shortly before}} the accident. On Thursday 15 June a captain complained that his inexperienced {{co-pilot}} [...] "would be useless in an emergency". Upset, the co-pilot committed a serious error on departure from Heathrow, setting the flaps <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> instead of up. The mistake was noted and remedied by the SFO, who related the event to colleagues as an example of avoidable danger. This became known among BEA pilots as the [...] "Dublin Incident".|$|R
50|$|Swiffer Dusters are {{disposable}} dusters. They are {{advertised as}} 360° (All-Around) but the traditional Swiffer Dusters {{are also available}} (one side only). The optional extensible handle is 3 <b>feet</b> long, <b>fully</b> extended. The Swiffer Duster was introduced in 2003.|$|R
50|$|They are hystricomorph rodents. They are {{medium-sized}} with rabbit like bodies, {{a squirrel}} face and heavily padded feet. Their nails are blunt on all digits except a small grooming claw on the outermost digit of the <b>foot.</b> <b>Fully</b> grown adult Kerodons weigh around 1000 grams or 31-35 ounces and range in length from 200 to 400 millimeters or 7.5 to 16 inches. They forage for food eating mostly leaves, grass, seeds, and tree bark. Kerdons breed year round usually having 1-3 litters {{per year and}} have 1-3 infants per pregnancy. Gestation last around 76 days and the infants are weaned from the mother within 33 days. They reach sexual maturity at 133 days.|$|R
25|$|The Boeing crew {{recovered}} from the dive, declared an emergency with New York Center, and received {{the first of many}} vectors to JFK International. They performed a damage assessment and asked that crash and fire equipment stand by. The Boeing was vectored south of JFK International where it made a wide 360 degree turn to check that the landing gear was <b>fully</b> <b>down</b> and to determine how the airplane would fly at approach speeds, and made a safe landing on Runway 31L at 1640.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fully</b> <b>Down</b> {{signed to}} Fearless Records in August 2005. Their Fearless debut, Don't Get Lost In A Movement was {{released}} in North America November 22, 2005. The following spring, the band headed out on the Fear and Loathing Tour with Protest The Hero, A Wilhelm Scream, Bayside and The Spill Canvas. The tour ended halfway through April, and they began touring with Boy Sets Fire and Versus the Mirror {{until the end of}} May. The summer of 2006 was spent back on the Warped Tour.|$|R
50|$|The only {{access to}} the $208 million complex of 23 {{buildings}} is an entry tunnel, allowing an uninterrupted perimeter fence. Individual pre-cast cells, of 80 square <b>feet,</b> were <b>fully</b> assembled off-site and then stacked by crane. The architects were the DLR Group.|$|R
2500|$|The A-22's {{structure}} is almost completely all-metal {{with only the}} engine cowling, wing fillets and wheel spats being made of composites. The wings and control surfaces are fabric covered. The aircraft has excellent visibility, due to {{the large amount of}} glazing, including convex doors, that allow the occupants to look straight down. The A-22 uses a 3-axis control system, giving the pilot full control over the aircraft. The A-22 uses flaperons in place of ailerons and flaps, giving a stall speed of [...] with the flaperons <b>fully</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After 24 {{years in}} business, New Venture Gear started {{to close in}} the week of August 20, 2012, and was <b>fully</b> shut <b>down</b> {{by the end of}} the week.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the strength of}} essential electronic and magnetic interactions in the iridates Sr_ 2 IrO_ 4 and Ba_ 2 IrO_ 4 - potential platforms for high-temperature superconductivity - we use many-body techniques from wavefunction-based electronic-structure theory. Multiplet physics, spin-orbit interactions, and Ir-O hybridization are all treated on equal <b>footing,</b> <b>fully</b> ab initio. Our calculations put the lowest d-d excitations of Sr_ 2 IrO_ 4 /Ba_ 2 IrO_ 4 at 0. 69 / 0. 64 eV, substantially lower than in isostructural cuprates. Charge-transfer excitations start at 3. 0 / 1. 9 eV and the magnetic nearest-neighbor exchange coupling is 51 / 58 meV. Available experimental results are fully consistent with these values, which strongly constrains the parametrization of effective iridate Hamiltonians...|$|R
50|$|Steussie {{would play}} {{the next two}} seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and joined the St. Louis Rams in 2006, where he became a starter {{for the first time}} since the 5th game of the 2004 season. He started 15 games in 2006 (8 at LT, 7 at LG). During this year, he helped Steven Jackson and Marc Bulger to {{breakout}} Pro Bowl seasons. He was given an injury settlement after undergoing foot surgery on August 31, 2007. Before week 12, Steussie was signed by the Rams after his <b>foot</b> <b>fully</b> recovered from surgery. He came back to the Rams and started 4 days later. Steussie then started the final six games. He was a free agent after the 2007 season.|$|R
50|$|Transmission {{of premium}} {{channels}} stopped in June 2010, {{and was replaced}} by a message that told viewers it was shutting down. The service was <b>fully</b> shut <b>down</b> in Autumn 2010.|$|R
