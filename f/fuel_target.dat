Given the past failures and rising costs, the Department of Energy decided to directly test the concept with a series of underground nuclear tests known as [...] "Halite" [...] and [...] "Centurion", depending on which lab was handling the experiment. Halite/Centurion placed typical ICF targets in hohlraums, metal cylinders intended to smooth out the driver's energy so it shines on the <b>fuel</b> <b>target</b> evenly. The hohlraum/fuel assemblies were then placed at various distances from a small atomic bomb, detonation of which released significant quantities of x-rays. These x-rays heated the hohlraums until they glowed in the x-ray spectrum (having been heated [...] "x-ray hot" [...] as opposed to [...] "white hot") and it was this smooth x-ray illumination that started the fusion reactions within the fuel. These experiments were used to justify fixes to the LASNEX predictions that led to the design of the National Ignition Facility concept.|$|E

The HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~ 30 - 40 %, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be ~ 50 - 70 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with the standard energy output of 1 GW of electricity. The HIF reactor operation frequency would be ~ 10 ~ 15 Hz or so. Several- MJ HIBs illuminate a fusion <b>fuel</b> <b>target,</b> and the <b>fuel</b> <b>target</b> is imploded to about a thousand times of the solid density. Then the DT fuel is ignited and burned. The HIB ion deposition range {{is defined by the}} HIB ions stopping length, which would be ~ 1 mm or so depending on the material. Therefore, a relatively large density-scale length appears in the <b>fuel</b> <b>target</b> material. One of the critical issues in inertial fusion would be a spherically uniform target compression, which would be degraded by a non-uniform implosion. The implosion non-uniformity would be introduced by the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability, and the large density-gradient-scale length helps to reduce the R-T growth rate.

40|$|Merger {{negotiations}} routinely occur amidst economically significant {{a target}} stock price runups. Since {{the source of}} the runup is unobservable (is it a target stand-alone value change and/or deal anticipation?), feeding the runup back into the offer price risks "paying twice" for the target shares. We present a novel structural empirical analysis of this runup feedback hypothesis. We show that rational deal anticipation implies a nonlinear relationship between the runup and the offer price markup (offer price minus runup). Our large-sample tests confirm the existence of this nonlinearity and reject the feedback hypothesis for the portion of the runup not driven by the market return over the runup period. Also, rational bidding implies that bidder takeover gains are increasing in target runups, which our evidence supports. Bidder toehold acquisitions in the runup period are shown to <b>fuel</b> <b>target</b> runups, but lower rather than raise offer premiums.

40|$|US {{and state}} governments have subsidized ethanol since 1978, and the {{rationale}} for these subsidies has varied over time from supporting farm prices and income, to environmental quality, and more recently to energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The recent boom in ethanol investment and production {{can be considered as}} an unintended consequence of an ethanol subsidy keyed to $ 20 crude oil and fixed at 51 cents per gallon combined with oil surging to $ 70 /bbl.

40|$|In {{inertial}} fusion, one {{of scientific}} issues {{is to reduce}} an implosion non-uniformity of a spherical <b>fuel</b> <b>target.</b> The implosion non-uniformity is caused by several factors, including the driver beam illumination non-uniformity, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) growth, etc. In this {{paper we propose a}} new control method to reduce the implosion non-uniformity; the oscillating implosion acceleration dg(t) is created by pulsating and dephasing heavy ion beams (HIBs) in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). The dg(t) would reduce the RTI growth effectively. The original concept of the non- uniformity control in inertial fusion was proposed in (Kawata, et al., 1993).

Multiple reflection and absorption of radiation at the fuel-tamper interface, fuel ablation and radial implosion driven by ablative shock and fast fusion rates on the fuel axis, at relatively later times, result into filamentary wave front. Strong pressure gradients are developed and sausage like structures behind the front are appeared.
