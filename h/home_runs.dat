5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in one game. Two of Lowe's <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in an 18-year career.|$|E

Thome's last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30.

5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E

50|$|Tyner finally hit {{his first}} major league <b>home</b> <b>run</b> against the Cleveland Indians on July 28, 2007, against Jake Westbrook. This <b>home</b> <b>run</b> came after 1,220 major league at bats in 390 career games and {{traveled}} 352 feet. At the time, Tyner had the longest <b>home</b> <b>run</b> drought in the major leagues.

5|$|The {{first home}} run {{champion}} in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural 1876 season, Hall hit five <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> for the short-lived National League Philadelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> for the American League Philadelphia Athletics. Over {{the course of his}} 22-season career, Babe Ruth led the American League in <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> 12 times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph Kiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt with eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven consecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run titles by any player. The most recent champions (2016) are Mark Trumbo with 47 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in the American League, and Nolan Arenado and Chris Carter tied with 41 in the National League.|$|E
5|$|With the LSU Tigers, Furniss was {{a two-time}} College World Series {{champion}} and a two-time All-American. He won the Dick Howser Trophy as college baseball's {{best player in}} 1998, and set Southeastern Conference (SEC) records in numerous offensive categories, including <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> and runs batted in (RBIs).

5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

With Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, and Waite Hoyt, the Yankees won three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and won the 1923 World Series. In 1925, he lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig, after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati.|$|E
