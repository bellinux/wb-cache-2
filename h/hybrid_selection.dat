It is hardy in USDA Zone 4. The plant likes some shade with moist, well-drained soil. The species itself is dioecious, thus flowers on a female plant will only produce fruit when fertilized with pollen from a male plant.

40|$|Abstract—P 2 P content {{providers}} {{are motivated to}} localize traf-fic within Autonomous Systems and therefore alleviate the tension with ISPs stemming from costly inter-AS traffic generated by geo-graphically distributed P 2 P users. In this paper, we first present a new three-tier framework to conduct a thorough study {{on the impact of}} various capacity aware or locality aware neighbor selection and chunk scheduling strategies. Specifically, we propose a novel <b>hybrid</b> neighbor <b>selection</b> strategy with the flexibility to elect neighbors based on either type of network awareness with different probabilities. We find that network awareness in terms of both capacity and locality potentially degrades system QoS as a whole and that capacity awareness faces effort-based unfairness, but enables contribution-based fairness. Extensive simulations show that <b>hybrid</b> neighbor <b>selection</b> can not only promote traffic locality but lift streaming quality and that the crux of traffic locality promotion is active overlay construction. Based on this observation, we then propose a totally decentralized network awareness protocol, equipped with <b>hybrid</b> neighbor <b>selection.</b> In realistic simulation environments, this protocol can reduce inter-AS traffic from 95 % to 38 % – a locality performance comparable with tracker-side strategies (35 %) under the premise of high streaming quality. Our performance evaluation results provide valuable insights for both theoretical study on selfish topologies and real-deployed system design.
