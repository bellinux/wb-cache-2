40|$|Naturally {{fractured}} reservoirs (NFR) {{represent an}} important fraction of oil {{reserves in the}} world. In many of the NFR, significant volumes of oil have been or {{are expected to be}} recovered from the matrix due to the presence of the <b>gas</b> gravity <b>drainage</b> drive mechanism. Nonetheless, there are some uncertainties to accurately predict oil recovery factors and remaining fluid saturations due to this drive mechanism despite the existence of studies performed in the last three decades. Several mathematical models for gravity drainage in NFR have been developed based on results obtained from laboratory experiments. However, these models have not provided accurate results in field applications. One of the reasons is that the experiments only considered an oil-gas system which in many cases is not a realistic assumption due to the presence of connate water in the reservoirs. Another reason is that, in some cases, heterogeneities, such as vuggy porosity, were ignored in both the experiments and the mathematical models. Based on these considerations, two long-term experiments that mimicked <b>gas</b> gravity <b>drainage</b> in NFR were performed. The experiments were carried out with the purpose of acquiring data that might be used to improve current mathematical models or to develop new ones. During the experiments, time-lapse X-Ray CT images were acquired at different intervals with the objective of determining the fluids saturation along the core samples due gravity drainage. Additionally, oil produced was measured. Experiment 1 was performed in an oil-brine-air system. A stack of six Berea sandstone core samples in capillary contact was used. Initially, the stack was saturated with oil at irreducible water saturation. Experiment 2 was performed in an oil-air system. A one-piece of Edwards limestone core with primary and vuggy porosity core was used. At the initial condition, the core was saturated with oil. Due to the presence of vugs, a novel technique was developed to quantify porosity and oil saturation for the primary porous system and the vuggy porous system. For both experiments, a good match between the measured oil produced and the remaining oil volume in the matrix estimated from the remaining fluids saturations obtained through the CT X-Ray images was observed. The techniques used in these experiments provide a new, unique and reliable method to study the important phenomenon of <b>gas</b> gravity <b>drainage</b> in NFR...|$|R

The water has the cushioning effect on detonation wave, which makes the wave crest truncated and results in low wave amplitude and large wave width. Detonation wave type has apparent influence on failure features of brittle materials, of which larger wave width would keep the wall of exploded hole intact and increase the development length of cracks.

40|$|The Yangquan {{coalfield}} {{is one of}} {{the typical}} highly gassy mining areas in China. However, its coal seams are of lower permeability, which are not conductive to coalbed methane (CBM) drainage. In this study, based on the theory of the ground movement, we analyzed the principle of coal and CBM coextraction in the Yangquan coalfield, and established the technology system of coal and CBM coextraction which was further implemented in the coal and CBM coextraction in the Yangquan coalfield.

40|$|At present, {{many high}} gas and {{outburst}} mines have poor <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> effects. An important reason influencing the <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> {{effect is a}} poor hole-sealing effect. Most studies on <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> borehole sealing focus on local and foreign borehole sealing methods, borehole sealing equipment, and borehole sealing materials. Numerical simulations of initial drilling sealing depth are insufficient because studies on this subject are few. However, when the initial sealing depth of the borehole is not chosen reasonably, air can enter the <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> drill hole through the circumferential crack of roadway surrounding rocks {{under the influence of}} suction pressure of the drainage system. This phenomenon ultimately affects the hole-sealing effect. To improve the drilling hole sealing of <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> boring, we deduced the expression formulas of the crushing zone, plastic zone, and elastic zone around the coal-seam floor stone drift and conducted a stress–strain analysis of the coal-seam floor stone drift of the 2145 working surfaces of the Sixth Coal Mine of Hebi Coal Mine Group Company by using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and on-scene verification.
