40|$|Abstrak. Proses grading telur menggunakan mesin merupakan salah satu upaya untuk meningkatkan kapasitas grading telur dengan hasil grading yang lebih seragam. Permasalahan yang sering terjadi dalam proses grading telur adalah posisi telur yang tidak sesuai. Hal ini menyebabkan telur tidak akan terbawa oleh konveyor grading sehingga dapat menghambat proses grading. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan membuat alat uji untuk mengubah posisi telur, selanjutnya menguji panjang lintasan rol pengarah, jarak sumbu rol pengarah dan grade telur terhadap perubahan posisi telur. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk membuktikan pengaruh panjang lintasan dan jarak sumbu rol pengarah serta grade telur terhadap perubahan posisi telur untuk mencapai posisi sejajar dengan rol pengarah. Hasil pengujian menunjukkan bahwa panjang lintasan dan jarak sumbu rol pengarah memiliki pengaruh yang sangat signifikan terhadap perubahan posisi telur, sedangkan grade telur memiliki pengaruh signifikan terhadap perubahan posisi telur. Jarak sumbu rol semakin lebar dan ukuran telur semakin kecil akan mendapatkan hasil yang semakin baik, hal ini ditunjukkan dengan perubahan posisi telur sejajar rol pengarah semakin cepat tercapai. Hasil terbaik untuk mendapatkan posisi telur sejajar dengan rol pengarah diperoleh pada perlakuan jarak sumbu rol pengarah 6 cm untuk telur grade C.   Experimental Study of Changes Position of <b>Eggs</b> on <b>Eggs</b> <b>Grading</b> Machine  Abstract. The grading {{process of}} using the <b>eggs</b> <b>grading</b> machine {{is one of the}} efforts to {{increase}} the capacity of the <b>eggs</b> <b>grading</b> with grading more uniform results. The problems that often occur in the process of <b>grading</b> <b>eggs</b> are the position of eggs is not perfect. That is causes the eggs will not be carried away by the grading conveyor so that can inhibit the process of grading. The method used in this research is to create a test tool to change the position of the eggs, then test the path distance of convey roller, width axis of convey roller and <b>eggs</b> <b>grade</b> against the <b>eggs</b> position changes. This research was conducted to find the influence of path distance and width axis of convey roller as well as <b>eggs</b> <b>grade</b> against the <b>eggs</b> position changes to achieve equal position with the convey rollers. The test results show that the path distance and width axis of convey roller have a very significant effect, whereas <b>eggs</b> <b>grade</b> {{have a significant effect on}} changes in the position of the egg. The increasing of width axis of convey roller and the smaller size of the eggs will get better results, as shown by changes in the position of the eggs to parallel the convey roller more quickly achieved. The best results obtained on the width axis of convey roller distance is 6 cm for <b>grade</b> C of <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Three cage {{designs and}} three {{population}} densities were evaluated for production and economic performance traits of caged layers. A deep cage measuring 38. 1 cm {{across the front}} and 50. 8 cm in depth was compared with two shallow cages measuring 60. 9 cm across the front and 31. 8 cm and 35. 5 cm in depth (shallow A and shallow B, respectively). Population sizes were 4, 5, and 6 birds per cage. Birds in the shallow cages had higher hen-day egg production values, gained more weight, had larger egg weights and egg mass, produced more <b>eggs</b> <b>grading</b> large and extra large, used more feed, and had higher pullet and feed costs than birds in the deep cages. Hen-housed production and mortality differences for cage designed were not present. Birds in shallow cages also had poorer feed conversion figures and reduced net egg incomes.

Six thousand color images of human-graded tomatoes and 750 images of human-graded eggs were used to train, test, and validate several multi-layered ANNs. The ANNs output the corresponding grade of the produce by accepting as inputs the spectral patterns of the background-less image.
