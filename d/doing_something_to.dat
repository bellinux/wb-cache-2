25|$|When Canada {{declared}} war in 1939, women felt obligated {{to help the}} fight. In October 1938, the Women’s Volunteer Service was established in Victoria, British Columbia. A recruitment event was held in hopes of gaining around 20 new volunteers; over 100 women arrived to join the efforts. Shortly after, more British Columbian women {{felt the need to}} do their part, and when the 13 corps joined together the B.C. Women’s Service Corps was created. Soon after, all the other Canadian provinces and territories followed suit and similar volunteer groups emerged. “Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining up, <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> help win the war. Surely women could help as well!” In addition to the Red Cross, several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It soon was clear, that a unified governing system would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in British Columbia donated $2 each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in Ottawa. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained ‘premature’ in terms of national necessity.|$|E
500|$|In early August up to 100 men, {{including}} Bucknall, Erskine, Hinde {{and other}} senior officers, {{were removed from}} their positions and reassigned. Historians largely agree {{that this was a}} consequence of the failure at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since the battle. Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle's outcome simply provided a convenient excuse and that the sackings took place to [...] "demonstrate that the army command was <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign".|$|E

500|$|As the 30th {{anniversary of}} Star Trek was approaching, {{a number of}} plans were being put into place. The film [...] was {{entering}} production, a television special was planned to celebrate the franchise and George Takei had been cast {{to appear in the}} [...] episode [...] "". Producer Ira Steven Behr later recalled that he thought that Deep Space Nine might end up being missed out as he considered it to be the [...] "middle child" [...] of the franchise. However, Rick Berman contacted Behr and asked him if he would be interested in <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the anniversary. Behr agreed to discuss it with the staff writers. Initially, there was concern that if the proposed episode aired during the actual anniversary week (around September 8), that it would have to serve as the season opener, pre-empting the already planned opener.|$|E
500|$|LaVey {{rejects the}} idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists {{to take action to}} fix a {{situation}} instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of [...] "controlled selfishness", in the sense that <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from [...] "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" [...] to [...] "Do unto others as they do unto you" [...] so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. The Book of Lucifer also contains a list of [...] "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" [...] (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven [...] "Infernal Names", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} sacramental {{confession}} requires three [...] "acts" [...] {{on the part}} of the penitent: contrition (sorrow of the soul for the sins committed), disclosure of the sins (the 'confession'), and satisfaction (the 'penance', i.e. <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> make amends for the sins). The basic form of confession has not changed for centuries, although at one time confessions were made publicly.|$|E

2500|$|Ernesto Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, Frantz Fanon and Subhas Chandra Bose were fervent {{critics of}} nonviolence, arguing {{variously}} that nonviolence and pacifism are {{an attempt to}} impose the morals of the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat, that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or {{that the right to}} self-defense is fundamental.

The cast found the experience informative; Murray explained, [...] "I realised that most cons are all about diversion – while you're trying to con somebody you're <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> distract them in the opposite direction so they don't notice and that's exactly how pickpockets work".|$|E
