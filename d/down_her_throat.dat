500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation. [...] Anne Greene, a woman {{sentenced to death}} and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. [...] They revived her by pouring hot cordial <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> rubbing her limbs and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating plasters and a [...] "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." [...] After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned.|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen {{spoke with her}} friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. [...] You want to pretend that they're just an object".|$|E
2500|$|January 9, 1997: Nine-year-old [...] "Girl X" [...] (since {{identified}} as Shatoya Currie) {{found in a}} seventh-floor stairwell at 1121 N. Larrabee Street after being raped, beaten, choked, poisoned by having a can of insecticide sprayed <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and covered in gang symbols. Her attacker then stepped on her throat. She was left for dead. Ultimately, the attacker was {{identified as}} Patrick Sykes and was found {{with the assistance of}} community members and building gang members, all of whom were outraged by the attack. [...] Sykes had a history of sexual crimes against women and girls, and admitted he covered Currie with gang symbols in an attempt to confuse investigators. Currie survived, but was blinded and left with significant brain damage. During her hospitalization, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan visited and prayed at her bedside.|$|E

2500|$|Crying {{and with}} compassion, {{she began to}} think about the {{foreskin}} of Christ, where it may be located [...] And behold, soon she felt with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which she swallowed. After she had swallowed it, she again felt the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again she swallowed it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all [...] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.|$|E
2500|$|While Godzilla and the MUTOs battle, {{a strike}} team, {{including}} Ford, enters the city via HALO jump {{to find and}} disarm the warhead. Unable to access the timer, {{the rest of the}} team sets the warhead on a boat for disposal at sea. The MUTOs are eventually able to get the upper hand, but Ford blows up the MUTO nest, ultimately distracting the MUTOs enough to allow Godzilla to emerge victorious in the end, killing the male MUTO by slamming him with his tail into the side of an office building and the female by firing his atomic breath <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> beheading her. Godzilla then collapses from exhaustion on the city shore. With {{the rest of the team}} wiped out, Ford uses the last of his energy to get the boat with the warhead out to sea. He is rescued before the warhead explodes and reunites with his family at the Oakland Coliseum emergency shelter the following morning. Godzilla awakens, rising from the destroyed San Francisco, and with a final, victorious roar returns to sea while the media hails Godzilla as [...] "King of the Monsters - savior of our city?".|$|E
2500|$|After six {{generations of}} gods, in the Babylonian Enûma Eliš, {{in the seventh}} generation, (Akkadian [...] "shapattu" [...] or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, {{the sons and daughters}} of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping the {{creation}} working. Abzu God of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the Gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides to take back the creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat's consort, for irrigation refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, God of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by Marduk, Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is Asshur. After dispatching Tiamat with the [...] "arrows of his winds" [...] <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of [...] "who will keep the cosmos working". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother Nammu (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) [...] "brings the tears of the gods" [...] before Enki and says ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} look of horror which came in Mme. la Marquise's eyes {{when she saw me}} {{entering}} our miserable attic {{in the company of a}} stranger. The last of the little bit of tallow candle flickered in its socket. Madame threw her emaciated arms over her child, just like some poor hunted animal defending its young. I could almost hear the cry of terror which died <b>down</b> in <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> ere it reached her lips. But then, monsieur, to see the light of hope gradually illuminating her pale, wan face as the stranger took her hand and spoke to her--oh! so gently and so kindly--was a sight which filled my poor, half-broken heart with joy.|$|R

60|$|All {{the while}} the peewits were {{screaming}} in the field. When he came to, {{he wondered what}} was near his eyes, curving and strong with life in the dark, and what voice it was speaking. Then he realised it was the grass, and the peewit was calling. The warmth was Clara's breathing heaving. He lifted his head, and looked into her eyes. They were dark and shining and strange, life wild at the source staring into his life, stranger to him, yet meeting him; {{and he put his}} face <b>down</b> on <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> afraid. What was she? A strong, strange, wild life, that breathed with his in the darkness through this hour. It was all so much bigger than themselves that he was hushed. They had met, and included in their meeting the thrust of the manifold grass stems, the cry of the peewit, the wheel of the stars.|$|R
60|$|Here poor Mrs. Vincy's spirit quite broke <b>down,</b> and <b>her</b> Niobe <b>throat</b> and good-humored face were sadly convulsed.

Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that the {{symptoms}} yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form of fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately to the druggist's and have a prescription made up in order to lose no time, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} cook, and he counted out the two hundred pennies, and Babo slipped {{them into his}} pocket. He bade the woman open her mouth, and when she had done so he poured all the stuff <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> at once.|$|E

50|$|She is the {{daughter}} of Mama D, aunt of Elgar, and sister of General Havoc. It is also implied that she is the twin sister of Dimitria. She apparently had at least one other sibling, as Elgar referred to Havoc as his uncle. She is an acquaintance of Rita Repulsa, too; once she even talked to her over the phone. She wears contact lenses, and can fire blasts of energy from her eyes. In turbo a power rangers movie divatox was starting to talk but a fly flew by and interrupted her. She turned and stared at the fly as it flew by. Divatox tried to continue but the fly flew by again but this time it landed on her leg. She looked down at the fly. She shot out her long sticky tongue and caught the fly on the tip. She pulled it back into her mouth and chewed the fly.
