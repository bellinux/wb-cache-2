25|$|If, therefore, in the <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> I {{fall into}} any errors, I {{hope they will}} be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as {{indicating}} that I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place {{at a time when}} the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres , and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover of}} each issue {{serves as the}} first panel to the story. Gibbons said, [...] "The cover of the Watchmen is {{in the real world}} and looks quite real, but it's {{starting}} to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension." [...] The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present. The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled [...] "Fearful Symmetry", so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.|$|E
500|$|The <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> are chiefly {{designed}} {{for the use of}} those who have no previous knowledge of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament; but since the Author has endeavoured to embody in them the results of very recent investigations, he hopes that they may prove of service to more advanced students. He asks the reader's indulgence for the annexed list of Addenda et Corrigenda, both by reason of the peculiar character of his work, and the remoteness of West Cornwall from Public Libraries. He might easily have suppressed the greater part of them, but that he has honestly tried to be accurate, and sees no cause to be ashamed of what Person has well called [...] "the common lot of authorship." [...] He has only to add that he has not consciously borrowed from other writers without due acknowledgement, and to return his best thanks to the Rev. H. O. Coxe for important aid in the Bodleian, and to Henry Bradshaw Esq., Fellow of King's College, for valuable instruction respecting manuscripts in the University Library at Cambridge.|$|E

500|$|Traditional tales {{collected}} by Gregorson Campbell were {{first published in}} the inaugural edition of the quarterly periodical the Scottish Celtic Review in March 1881. Reproduced in Gaelic and translated on the <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> in English, it was entitled [...] "How the great Tuairisgeul was put to death" [...] and told how {{the son of the}} King of Ireland went to a hunting hill and sought the answer to the death of the Great Tuairisgeul. Further legends from his collection were included in the next three volumes of the review. The Gaelic Society of Inverness published some of the tales, also given in Gaelic with an English translation, from 1888 until 1892. The first of these in 1888, [...] "Sir Olave O'Corn", also involved a King of Ireland and included some explanatory notes from Gregorson Campbell. Celtic Magazine and Highland Monthly were two other journals that published some of his folklore. Some of these were reprinted in the first compendium of Gregorson Campbell's collection, The Fians, a set of traditional tales and verses about combat printed as part of the Argyllshire series of books in 1891.|$|E

2500|$|B's spoken lectures in Germany {{are fully}} written {{out at the}} end of the book in a roughly 80-page-long {{appendix}} called [...] "The Public Teachings" [...] (with a header on each of the <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> that reads [...] "The Teachings of B"). Although the main text of the book is written in first-person point of view from Jared’s perspective, the author Quinn's real-life perspective echoes that of B, written in this appendix. The following teachings are from the lectures of B and represent Daniel Quinn’s historically-based ideas of human evolution and the future of human history.|$|E

2500|$|The {{physician}} Valerius Cordus, son of {{the famous}} botanist Euricius Cordus, went through many woods and mountains discovering hundreds of new herbs. He gave lectures on Dioscorides at the University of Wittenberg, which experts from the University attended. Cordus {{had no intention of}} publishing his work. Five years after his death, a Materia Medica with commentaries was published. It contained the index of the Botanologicon, the outstanding work of his father Euricius, who developed a scientific classification of the plants. The <b>following</b> <b>pages</b> are on Gesner's Nomenclature, [...] relating the different synonyms used for referring to the same plants of the Dioscorides work.|$|E
2500|$|Canon of the Mass (Latin: Canon Missæ, Canon Actionis) is {{the name}} given in the Roman Missal, from the first typical edition of Pope Pius V in 1570 to that of Pope John XXIII in 1962, to {{the part of the}} Mass of the Roman Rite that begins after the Sanctus with the words Te igitur. All editions {{preceding}} that of 1962 place the indication [...] "Canon Missae" [...] at the head of each page from that point {{until the end of the}} Mass; that of 1962 does so only until the page preceding the Pater Noster and places the heading [...] "Ordo Missae" [...] on the <b>following</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{description}} of the misunderstanding between Haig and Gough is contradicted by an account on the <b>following</b> <b>pages,</b> of a visit made on 27 June by Haig to the headquarters of II Corps. Jacob asked that his southern flank be extended to allow {{an attack on the}} Bassevillebeek Spur (Tower Hamlets) beyond the Bassevillebeek Stream, to deny the German army a jumping-off place, for counter-attacks against the right flank of the corps. Haig emphasised the importance of the capture of the plateau and arranged with the Fifth Army headquarters [...] "at once", for II Corps to take command of the 24th Division (Major-General Major-General Louis Bols) to the south, that was the northernmost division of the Second Army. The Fifth Army–Second Army boundary was moved south on 4 July, to the [...] road. In a footnote Edmonds described the transfer of the artillery of the 23rd Division (Major-General J. M. Babington), the 24th Division artillery, thirteen medium [...] ( [...] and [...] batteries from the Second Army to II Corps.|$|E
