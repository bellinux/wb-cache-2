40|$|Background. Most current paper- and {{computer-based}} formats {{for patient}} documentation use a two-dimensional dental chart, {{a design that}} originated almost 150 {{years ago in the}} United States. No studies have investigated the inclusion of a three-dimensional (3 -D) charting interface in a general <b>dental</b> <b>record.</b> Methods. A multidisciplinary research team with expertise in human-computer interaction, dental informatics and computer science conducted a 14 -week project to develop and evaluate a proof of concept for a 3 -D <b>dental</b> <b>record.</b> Through several iterations of paper- and computer-based prototypes, the project produced a high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype that was evaluated by two dentists and two dental students. Results. The project implemented a prototypical patient record built around a 3 -D model of a patient's maxillofacial structures. Novel features include automatic retrieval of images and radiographs; a flexible view of teeth, soft tissue and bone; access to historical patient data through a timeline; and the ability to focus on a single tooth. Conclusions. Users tests demonstrated acceptance for the basic design of the prototype, but also identified several challenges in developing intuitive, easy-to-use navigation methods and hi-fi representations in a 3 -D record. Clinical Implications. Test participants in this project accepted the preliminary design of a 3 -D <b>dental</b> <b>record.</b> Significant further research must be conducted before the concept can be applied and evaluated in clinical practice...|$|R

5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and <b>dental</b> <b>records.</b> Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E

40|$|A well designed, {{adequately}} {{documented and}} properly maintained patient record {{is an important}} tool for quality assurance. The aim of this cross-sectional, descriptive study is to specify and quantify the adequacy of <b>dental</b> patient <b>record</b> keeping and its usefulness for quality assurance purposes. Two study sites were chosen: Alexandra Public Dental Clinic in the township of Alexandra, Johannesburg, and the Department of Restorative Dentistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The study population included all patients who attended either clinic in 1998 and 1999. One hundred names qualified for inclusion from the 400 names randomly drawn from {{the records of the}} Department of Restorative Dentistry and another 100 from the random selection of 120 names from the Alexandra Clinic. A validated check-list encompassed eight key areas as follows: patient identification, medical, and dental history, clinical examination, radiographs, diagnosis, treatment plan and progress notes. This was used to measure the adequacy of <b>dental</b> patient <b>record</b> keeping. The patient records of both groups had incomplete and inconsistent documentation. Information such as the identity of patients, diagnosis, treatment plan and procedure, materials used, and radiographic information were often missing. Non-existent record cards and often incomplete and inconsistent information gathering reflected a lack of attention to, and standardisation of, <b>dental</b> <b>record</b> keeping in these two study sites. Adequate patient records lead to complete and accurate documentation of the dental care process. At both study sites, the patient record form needed to be revised in order to meet standard requirements. In general, documentation at both clinics was poor. None of the patient records fulfilled all the variables included in the study. At the Alexandra Clinic patient records were deficient in documentation in all sectors. The Department of Restorative Dentistry provided patient records that adequately demonstrated the dental care process, but were lacking in accuracy and completeness. Lack of standardisation and non-uniformity of information was evident at both of the clinics. Adequate patient records that are completed correctly provide the basis for assessment of the dental care process. The problem orientated approach to dental care is best assured by using <b>dental</b> patient <b>records</b> which divide the dental care process into four particular categories: the assessment, the diagnosis, the treatment plan and the provision of treatment. At the Alexandra Clinic, the inadequate patient records apparently contributed to inferior documentation of the dental care process. Documentation style also reflected the given treatment regime, which was mainly pain relief procedures. The <b>dental</b> patient <b>record</b> at the Alexandra Clinic did not follow the problem orientated approach, leaving most o f the burden on adequate documentation for the oral health care professional to demonstrate the dental care process. Lack of understanding of the purpose of complete and accurate documentation was evident at the Department of Restorative Dentistry. Owing to inadequate patient record design at the Alexandra Clinic, and due to inadequate documentation in both of the clinics, it was impossible to use <b>dental</b> patient <b>records</b> for quality assurance purposes. Whether these deficiencies affect the quality of care can only be speculated. The patient record is a very important prerequisite for quality assurance in dental care. The government and the professional organisations such as the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the South African Dental Association should be largely Tegi-. visible for the creation, implementation and monitoring of the policies for quality assurance. These institutions jointly should promulgate rules about adequate patient record keeping. There is a further need for better training in formulary for dental students and postgraduates. There is also a necessity for more intensive monitoring and evaluation in the field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Identification of {{deceased}} individuals {{based on}} dental characteristics is receiving increased attention. Dental radiographic films {{of an individual}} are usually composed into a digital image record. In order to achieve high level of automation in postmortem identification, {{it is necessary to}} decompose <b>dental</b> image <b>records</b> into their constituent radiographic films, which are in turn segmented to localize dental regions of interest. In this paper we offer an automatic hierarchical treatment to the problem of cropping <b>dental</b> image <b>records</b> into films. Our approach is heavily based on concepts of mathematical morphology and shape analysis. Among the many challenges we face are non-standard assortments of films into records, variability in record digitization as well as randomness of record background both in intensity and texture. We show by experimental evidence that our approach achieves high accuracy and timeliness. ...|$|R
