5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
25|$|The {{staircases}} in {{the four}} corners of the lobby leading <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> floor were originally embellished with a four-piece commissioned sculpture, The 20th Century–Thames by Keith Milow. Around 2014, one of the tondi was removed to make room for a restaurant. The other three remain in situ.|$|E

25|$|Sometime between 10:15 and 11:15 pm, a drunk McGreavy became infuriated {{with the}} Ralph children, {{beginning}} with the baby, Samantha, who had been crying for her bottle. McGreavy violently killed Samantha {{and then the other}} two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a fractured skull, 2-year-old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy went <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and retrieved a pickaxe. He further mutilated their bodies with the pickaxe before impaling the three bodies on the spikes of a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home.|$|E
500|$|Slaton {{was also}} {{convinced}} that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank's office. Slaton accepted the defense's argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement. Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, {{when he left the}} company in 1912, [...] "he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders... and sent them <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> to be burned.

50|$|City Hall was {{designed}} and built with a non-powered air-conditioning system, taking advantage of strong prevailing winds from Lake Erie. Large vents {{were placed on the}} west side of <b>the</b> building <b>to</b> catch wind, which would then travel <b>down</b> ducts <b>to</b> beneath <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>to</b> be cooled by the ground. This cooled air was then vented throughout the building. Winds off the lake were usually strong enough to power air through this system.|$|R

Alone in the hub, Ianto {{brings in}} Japanese {{cybernetics}} expert Dr. Tanizaki (Togo Igawa) down to a basement deep inside, home to Lisa Hallett, Ianto's girlfriend. They both worked in Torchwood One during the events of Doctor Whos [...] "Doomsday", when Cybermen partially converted Lisa before the invasion ended. Ianto has since cared for her by placing her in the basement with a conversion unit to keep her alive. Ianto wants Tanizaki to reverse the process. Tanizaki is able to make her breathe on her own again, but by that time, the team is recalled back to deal with a rogue unidentified flying object. When Tanizaki brings Lisa back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> her Cyberman influence takes over and she kills him by attempting to [...] "upgrade" [...] him.|$|E

These are allegedly the ghosts of DeBatt and Joseph D'Angelo. They also report hearing voices and the sound of a chainsaw. They say they can smell foul odors and they had the feeling that they were being watched by someone. A cousin of the current restaurant owner, Angela Perrone stated, [...] "The place is definitely haunted. There's a creepiness, as if someone's always watching you. It's a sinister energy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kewanee {{was well}} known in the steam {{industry}} for fire-tube boilers. The Kewanee Boiler Corporation manufactured and sold thousands of boilers throughout the world for well over one hundred years. However, the company failed in 2002 and was forced to go out of business. However, these boilers are still extremely common. An example of a Kewanee steam boiler can be seen in a scene in the movie The Blues Brothers. Specifically, when Cab Calloway's character named Curtis offers to [...] "buy you boys a drink", he takes Jake and Elwood <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orphanage's <b>basement,</b> where <b>the</b> boiler is easily seen in the background. A Kewanee boiler is also the dwelling place for the character Suzie DeSoto, played by Debra Winger, in the 1982 film version of John Steinbeck's book Cannery Row. The Kewanee High School athletic teams are nicknamed the [...] "Boilermakers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Leaving his {{duffel bag}} under a stairwell, Wesbecker walked <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> where he {{encountered}} pressman John Tingle who, alerted by the loud noises, {{went to see}} what was going on.

[...] After Tingle moved out of his way, Wesbecker continued his path through the basement, shooting Richard Barger in the back, killing him. According to witnesses, Wesbecker approached Barger's body and apologized, having apparently killed him accidentally, as he could not see at whom he was shooting.|$|E
2500|$|Gunston Hall has a basement, {{which has}} a main passage and four rooms like the floor above it. Three {{staircases}} lead <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> The basement contains four brick arched chimney supports, and nine small windows. In 1975, a cast iron stove was excavated from the basement. The style of the stove suggests {{it is from the}} 18th or early 19th century. Around 1986, a [...] "shallow subsurface perimeter drainage system" [...] was built about four feet (1.2m) away from the foundation walls, due to an excess ground moisture. This significantly reduced standing water in the basement.|$|E

25|$|The oats are hoisted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bin {{floor at}} the top of the mill, from where they are emptied into a hopper that feeds one of the mill's two pairs of {{millstones}} situated on the mill floor. This pair of sandstone millstones shells the grain, and the output is then sent <b>down</b> a chute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> where <b>the</b> shelled oats ("groats") are separated from the husks using a fan. The groats are then hoisted back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top floor and fed through the second pair of millstones (made of French burr stone). This produces the oatmeal, which descends <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> for bagging.|$|R

50|$|In {{support of}} his abiotic theory, Kudryavtsev stated in 1973 (Genesis of Gas and Oil) that any region in which {{hydrocarbons}} are found at one level will also have hydrocarbons in large or small quantities at all levels <b>down</b> <b>to</b> and into <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> rock. Thus, where oil and gas deposits are found, there will often be coal seams above them. Gas is usually the deepest in the pattern, and can alternate with oil. All petroleum deposits have a capstone, which is generally impermeable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upward migration of hydrocarbons. This capstone leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accumulation of the hydrocarbon.|$|R
2500|$|Smit {{assessed}} {{the evidence and}} concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. Smit's theory was that someone broke into the Ramseys' home through the broken basement window. The intruder subdued JonBenét using a stun gun and took her <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> JonBenét was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit's theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. [...] Believing that the Ramseys were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, {{five days after the}} grand jury convened against the Ramseys. While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The Jonesboro Grange {{is located}} in the town's {{dispersed}} rural village, {{on the south side of}} Harrington Road (US 1), the principal east-west artery in the region. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a poured concrete foundation. Its front facade is symmetrical, with a pair of sash windows flanking a double-leaf entrance that is topped by a three-light transom window. A small sash window is set in the gable above. The first-floor windows on the front and sides are flanked by three-board shutters, and have small flower boxes below the sill. The interior is divided into a foyer space and main hall, with stairs leading up to a balcony and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full <b>basement</b> in one corner of the foyer. The interior of the foyer and main hall are finished in vertical bead-board wainscoting, with plaster above in the foyer and painted tin on the main hall. <b>The</b> <b>basement</b> is partially finished, providing a kitchen and dining space as well as storage.|$|R

40|$|A gravity {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in the Somma-Vesuvius complex area (Campania, Italy) based on a dataset recently enlarged with new measurements. These cover the volcanic top and fill some other important spatial gaps in previous surveys. Besides the new gravity map of the Vesuvius, we also present the results of a 3 D inverse modelling, carried out by using constraints from deep well exploration and seismic reflection surveys. The resulting density model provides a complete reconstruction of the top of <b>the</b> carbonate <b>basement.</b> This is relevant mostly on the western side of the survey area, where no significant information was previously available. Other new information regards the Somma-Vesuvius structure. It consists of an annular volume of rocks around the volcanic vent and that extends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carbonate <b>basement.</b> It results to be denser with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounding sedimentary cover of the Campanian Plain and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> material located just along the central axis of the volcanic structure. The coherence between these features and other geophysical evidences from previous studies, will be discussed together with the other results of this research...|$|R
6000|$|A little Far-Western girl of nine, {{equipped}} with an adult vocabulary, states her age and says, [...] "I thought I would write a demonstration to you." [...] She had a claim, derived from getting flung over a pony's head and landed on a rockpile. She saved herself from disaster by remembering to say [...] "God is All" [...] {{while she was in}} the air. I couldn't have done it. I shouldn't even have thought of it. I should have been too excited. Nothing but Christian Science could have enabled that child to do that calm and thoughtful and judicious thing in those circumstances. She came down on her head, and by all the rules she should have broken it; but the intervention of the formula prevented that, so the only claim resulting was a blackened eye. Monday morning it was still swollen and shut. At school [...] "it hurt pretty badly--that is, it seemed to." [...] So [...] "I was excused, and went <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and said, 'Now I am depending on mamma instead of God, and I will depend on God instead of mamma.'"

30|$|To {{correctly}} image faults with {{a significant}} apparent offset, seismic lines {{have to be as}} perpendicular as possible to fault plane direction (Lavergne 1986). However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> large distances between old seismic lines, an important uncertainty remained on the fault geometry in <b>the</b> cross-line direction. <b>To</b> obtain a better azimuthal constraint and obtain information all along the well trajectories, two extra lines, respectively, NW–SE and NE–SW were set up. The obliqueness of these seismic lines compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main fault plane direction remains low enough to ensure a right migration of the sloping reflectors (Yilmaz 1987, 2001), while allowing intersection of possible faults in between two seismic lines. Ideally, accurate information regarding target depths, frequency contents and propagation velocities in the different geological layers are necessary <b>to</b> define <b>the</b> key parameters of a seismic acquisition. Reprocessing and reinterpretation of old seismic lines provide access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> information necessary <b>to</b> define <b>the</b> optimal geometry that properly images <b>the</b> deepest layers <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>basement</b> and <b>the</b> identified target.|$|R
