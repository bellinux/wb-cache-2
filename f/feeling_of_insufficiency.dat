In addition to this distress, the residue of the original, primary feeling of inferiority may still haunt an adult.

40|$|The Åkerblom {{movement}} {{exemplifies the}} best known impact on the cultural and religious environment of Swedish Finland, of a geographically and historically extensive phenomenon—the prophet movement. In spite of its proximity in time, some preparatory research {{has been carried out}} on the subject, even if a special study is still lacking. ' An obvious prerequisite for the emergence of a prophet movement is the prophet figure. The character and development of the movement are, to a great extent, dependent on the background and personality of this figure. The adolescence of Ida Maria Åkerblom (IMÅ), a cottar's daughter, born in Snappertuna in rural West Nyland in 1898, was both materially and spir-itually barren. Youngest but one in a family of nine children, she was a late developer and of a sickly constitution.

40|$|Objective: Early onset {{aggression}} {{is a public}} health problem. We aimed to investigate the associated factors of aggressive behaviours in preschool children. Patients and Methods: Seventy two children (aged between 1 and 6) with primary complaints of severe aggressive behaviours by their parents and 72 healthy controls {{were included in the}} study. A semi-structured inquiry-form on demographic features, personal and psychiatric characteristics of parents and mother-child relationship patterns were given to the mothers. The Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were given to the mothers. Results: Parental education levels were lower in the patient group. Parents' problematic experiences with anger, mothers' <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in parenting and marital quarreling were found to be higher in the patient group. The frequency of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and the postnatal period as well as mothers' current BDI scores were higher in the patient group. According to a logistic regression analysis, the ABC hyperactivity score, mothers' <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in parenting and fathers' problematic experiences with anger were found to be associated with aggressive behaviours in the patients. Conclusion: Aggression in preschool children is associated with multiple factors. The examination of parental characteristics appears to be especially important in the evaluation of affected children. (Marmara Medical Journal 2011; 24 : 172 - 8...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Inconsolable infant fussing and/or crying is {{a common}} reason for parent´s to seek help with {{professionals}} and is a cause of great stress within the family. Aim: To produce and evaluate a leaflet about infantile colic and elucidate how parents experienced their child’s colic period. Method: The study {{was based on a}} descriptive survey containing thirteen open questions assessing parents’ experiences of the colic period and the support from the Child Health Care (CHC) nurse. The questions also addressed the design and content of the leaflet. Ten mothers completed the survey and the results were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The main theme found was; “The infantile colic overshadowed everything – and created <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in the parenting role”. Seven categories were identified; Wessel’s definition of infantile colic agreed, Sleep- and breastfeeding experiences, Thought´s about the colic period, Strong emotions developed during the colic period, Coping strategies, Support and advice, Content in the information brochure.    Conclusion: Infantile colic effected the entire family, caused crisis and strong feelings such as powerlessness when nothing would calm or ease the baby´s cry. The <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> being insufficient would create problems with the attachment to the baby. The CHC nurse should support the family members and strengthen them in their ability to cope with their baby´s cry. The leaflet “Infantile colic – the infant´s cry the first months in life” could reduce parents’ self-accusation and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> It could help parents´ attain a sense of control over the situation and encourage the development of a secure attachment. The leaflet will be corrected with advice of using a diary to elucidate the time of crying. It will also contain information about the risk of shaken baby syndrome...|$|R

All participants had experienced that a basic course was not enough. There was still a need for further competence. The occupational therapists had partly modified the way they worked since they learned MI.

DAUM, Dialekt-, ortnamns- och folkminnesarkivet, the Archive for Dialects, Placenames and Folklore, in Umeå, Sweden, {{is responsible for}} the documentation of a huge territory, which we do not regret. Nor do we regret the fact that the archive also grasps a wide range of subjects. We have, however, very few staff, and a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is not unusual. One way to conquer this feeling is offered by the ongoing discourse that takes place at our establishment – a discourse that is immaterial yet constitutes a solid ground from which to take bearings in our work with such a vast volume of cultural heritage. My first meeting with DAUM as an employee was full of inspiring brainstorming with the former head Jan Nilsson – an open-minded discussion which still continues with Ola Wennstedt, the present director of the archive. In the 1990 s a reorganisation of the establishment (at the national level) has been taking place and we have had to analyse the whole organisation and DAUM’s place therein. There were policy questions and economic cutbacks, and priorities had to be established in different spheres of activity.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of nursing care {{is to maintain}} an individual self-sufficient {{for as long as}} possible, to improve their quality of life and to provide orientation or life programme in psychical and social activities. A need arises from a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or excess in biological, psychological, social or spiritual fields. This thesis addresses the issue of provision of nursing care and satisfaction of patients needs in sanatoriums and in home care from the view of nurses. The thesis comprised quantitative research made by means of questionnaires completed by 64 nurses from 6 addressed sanatoriums and 9 home-care agencies. The bachelors thesis attempted to ascertain opportunities for provision of health care and satisfaction of lower and higher needs. Three hypotheses were raised. The first hypothesis was focused on nurses providing home care and claimed that they provided their clients with more comprehensive nursing care. The results of the research have confirmed this hypothesis. Nurses from home-care agencies provide professional health care and satisfy lower and higher needs at the same time. Nurses working in sanatoriums satisfy lower and higher needs less than nurses providing home care. The second hypothesis addressed influence of the type of organization on satisfaction of clients needs. This hypothesis has been confirmed by the results of the research. Nurses providing home care have more room to meet the needs than nurses working in sanatoriums. The third hypothesis concerned the question whether nurses providing home care have more room for satisfaction of higher needs than nurses in sanatoriums. This hypothesis has also been confirmed {{on the basis of the}} results. The research revealed that a part of nurses working in sanatoriums have little time for satisfaction of lower and higher needs. Regrettably, the answer that satisfaction of these needs is not necessary and even if it was, there would not be time for that was not exceptional. An approach to nursing care and patients needs has been undergoing continuous development. What used to be sufficient in former times is not sufficient at present. I believe that it would be useful for nurses to recommend them making use of education to a larger extent. They should realize the needs arising from illnesses since satisfaction of these needs is a part of the therapeutic process. I would also recommend that heads of sanatoriums and home-care agencies should obtain more quality compensation equipment and modern medical supplies, and consider the number of nursing staff as compared to the number of treated clients since provision of quality nursing care is the aim of every nurse...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: GPs {{report that}} patients' psychosocial {{problems}} {{play a part}} in 20 % of all consultations. GPs state that these consultations are more time-consuming and the perceived burden on the GP is higher. AIM: To investigate whether GPs' workload in consultations is related to psychological or social problems of patients. Design of study: A cross-sectional national survey in general practice, conducted in the Netherlands from 2000 - 2002. SETTING: One hundred and four general practices in the Netherlands. METHOD: Videotaped consultations (n = 1392) of a representative sample of 142 GPs were used. Consultations were categorised in three groups: consultations with a diagnosis in the International Classification of Primary Care chapter P 'psychological' or Z 'social' (n = 138), a somatic diagnosis but with a psychological background according to the GP (n = 309), or a somatic diagnosis and background (n = 945). Workload measures were consultation length, number of diagnoses and GPs' assessment of sufficiency of patient time. RESULTS: Consultations in which patients' mental health problems play a part (as a diagnosis or in the background) take more time and involve more diagnoses, and the GP is more heavily burdened with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> <b>of</b> patient time. In consultations with a somatic diagnosis but psychological background, GPs more often experienced a lack of time compared to consultations with a psychological or social diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Consultations in which the GP notices psychosocial problems make heavier demands on the GP's workload than other consultations. Patients' somatic problems that have a psychological background induce the highest perceived burden on the GP. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Burnout {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} occupational hazards within academia; every semester there are academics in Iceland that barely manage, or worse, that are simply unable to finish the term because of a burnout. The academic work culture and the academic work ethic have among other things been identified as causes for burnout (Heijstra, under review). Conceptualising burnout has been problematic though, and a unified definition of the concept is still non-existent. In a book on burnout for experts (Bährer-Kohler, 2013, p 1) it can be read that: “Burnout can be described as a condition based on the protracted depletion of an individual‘s energies, characterized by emotional exhaustion, reduced personal accomplishment, and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and depersonalization. Burnout features certain facets and other characteristics that are related to the individual, always context- and/or organization-related and influenced by living conditions”. While the association between burnout and work has functioned as a general identifier to the condition for the past three decades, more recent research argues that burnout should be approached as a multi-domain condition (Bianchi et al, 2014) in which triggers for burnout do not necessarily derive from the work environment only, but can for instance also develop from privat...|$|R

As a result of this, our project seeks {{to examine the relationship}} between stress and students at Roskilde University based on a social constructivist approach with the follo-wing thesis statement: How do the students articulate stress and how does this have an impact on their everyday lives? The project is based on C. Willig’s Foucauldian version of discourse analysis in order {{to examine the relationship between}} the use of discour-ses, practices and subjectivity. Five students have been interviewed regarding stress and their everyday lives. The analysis model will be used to examine the students’ articulations about stress. The project concludes that the students mainly use three discourses, which are all cla-rified by theories of N. Rose: A neo-liberal discourse, a biomedical discourse and a discourse about self-development. The students produce and reproduce these discourses, which im-plicates that the students feel stress in their everyday lives. The discourses have further consequences for the students’ subjective experiences. The neo-liberal discourse and the dis-course of self-development can e. g. lead to <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> as a result of articulated unachievable goals.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Two {{to three}} weeks after the {{explosion}} of a fireworks storage facility in a residential area (May 2000, Enschede, The Netherlands) we assessed the self-reported physical and mental health among those affected by the disaster. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3792 residents, passers-by, and rescue workers, who were involved in and/or affected by the disaster and were > or = 18 years of age. RESULTS: At least 30 % of those affected by the disaster reported serious physical and mental health problems 2 - 3 weeks after the explosion. Compared with reference values in the general Dutch population, high scores were found for somatic symptoms, sleeping problems, and restrictions in daily functioning due to physical and mental problems, such as anxiety, depression, and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The strength <b>of</b> these differences varied between groups, based on the level of involvement and the level of being affected. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the fireworks disaster had a substantial impact on the health of those affected by the disaster.

40|$|The {{amount of}} older people {{receiving}} home nursing care is increasing; in rural areas, they are at additional risk because of the distance between people and health care facilities. No specific studies have been found about oldest old men living alone and receiving home nursing care {{and the meaning of}} living alone in one’s own home. The aim of this study was therefore to illuminate the meaning of being an oldest old man living alone in a rural area and receiving home nursing care. A sample of 12 oldest old men living in rural areas in the middle of Norway was chosen for this study. Narrative interviews were conducted, and data were analyzed using the phenomenological hermeneutical method. After a naı̈ve reading and a structural analysis of the text, we identified three themes: <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in everyday life, finding hope in life, and feeling reconciliation with life. The comprehensive understanding suggested that being an oldest old man living alone in a rural area means a struggle between a dependent existence and a desire to be independent. Living in the tension between independence and dependency is a complex emotional situation where one is trying to accept the consequences of life and loss*reconciling the wish to live with the fact that life will come to an end...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} men and women is {{conspicuous}} in T. S. Eliot's early poetry. It constitutes the subject of this study, which is an investigation of the symbolic images, metaphors and similes associated with this theme. When a man/woman relationship is referred to, the relevant imagery is often taken from historical or mythical narratives, suggesting an element of universal applicability. Painful feelings and experiences are couched in this indirectly expressive idiom. Contacts between man and woman in these early poems always result in suffering; women are repeatedly abandoned and men left alone with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Pain is shared equally by the two sexes. The sexual undertone in the early "Love Song" runs through Eliot's poetry between 1910 and 1925, gaining greater emphasis in The Waste Land and The Hollow Men. The agony and distress associated with sexual matters {{play a vital role in}} his early poems, a circumstance which has not always been fully recognized. Erotic concerns and preoccupations fill the lives of the main "characters" in this poetry, men and women alike. However, experiences of this kind are unsettling, and any attempt at a dialogue between the sexes is bound to fail. In each of the four collections, the theme of relationships between men and women indicates a step further downwards into isolation. There is an afflicting want <b>of</b> any <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> love and tenderness - only a mechanized sexuality is left, stripped of all its generative force and with sterility and impotence as the consistent, final result...|$|R

People with severe mental illness have {{an increased risk of}} metabolic abnormalities and obesity, leading to an increased incidence for T 2 DM. District nurses with advanced training in diabetes care will in their profession give support to lifestyle changes and healthy living habits. Aim The {{purpose of this study was}} to illuminate district nurses´ experience of how they can support people with T 2 DM and serious mental illness. Method A qualitative methodology based on individual interviews analyzed with qualitative content analysis was used. Twelve informants were part of the study. Results The individual meeting with mutual relations and respect for individuals was important. During periods of worsening mental health of the patient, the district nurses provide support and monitoring, adjusted to the patients' ability. The district nurses felt inadequacy and frustration when the patients' physical and mental health were deteriorating. The strategy was to acknowledge progress when small improvements were made and extended contacts with nurses in out-patient psychiatry were requested. Conclusion Support was designed as respectful treatments and individual meetings were prioritized. District nurses' strategies were to guide the patient by positive attitudes according to the individual, and by giving support adapted to the needs of the patient. Despite <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> the district nurses never gave up and conveyed the message to never let go.

However, does police presence solve {{the concerns of the}} schools? The problem aim was to reveal the experiences and expectations of the police officers as well limitations and expenditures contextualising school-police liaison. Method and data: Eight interviews in total were performed with police officers in Gothenburg, Sweden. Six of those were community police officers and one was the community chief of police, all located in local-police-department of north-eastern Gothenburg.

Satisfactory reliability and validity data were obtained for the Chinese version of the four occupational stress scales. After self-rated abilities were taken into account, occupational stress remained a significant predictor of teaching style. A stronger <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> role overload and more frequent use of a rational/cognitive coping strategy were conducive to employing both creativity-generating and conservative teaching styles; a stronger <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> role <b>insufficiency</b> and psychological strain had a negative impact on the use of creative-generating teaching styles.

40|$|Aim: To {{examine how}} {{midwives}} describe good and safe postpartum care of mothers with infants in neonatal care, and which prerequisites and obstacles they see to giving good and safe care while minimizing time of separation. Method: Semi structured qualitative interviews with ten midwives at two maternity wards in Uppsala. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and processed by manifest analysis. Results: Three categories were identified, Good and safe care, Organization {{as an obstacle}} and The midwife role. Good and safe postpartum care of mothers with infants in neonatal care required knowledge, appropriate equipment, good guidelines, possibility to see the mother, contact between mother and infant and good collaboration between the maternity and neonatal wards. This collaboration was insufficient. Organizational obstacles were shortage of staff, lack of guidelines and {{the distance between the}} wards. The midwives thought that integrated care of mother and child would be optimal, or at least a midwife responsible for the mother at the neonatal ward and a pediatric nurse on the maternity ward. The midwife saw herself as the woman's advocate who perceives the family as a whole. Being responsible for the mother´s care, their dilemma was how to prioritize between medical safety and encouraging her to stay with her infant. Conclusions: This is a topic that midwives are committed to. It causes frustration and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> but also <b>of</b> being important and capable of making a difference. Many thoughts about how the nursing care functions and should be provided were found.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to get information about different kinds of clients with social phobia and their therapeutic progress in cognitive-constructivist group psychotherapy. The aim was also to offer relevant information to clinicians working with socially phobic clients on how they could help the progress of the successful therapeutic change process of socially phobic clients, especially in early phases of the therapy when clients are developing a reflexive stance toward their own problematic experiences. Study I supported the view that negative self-image is central to social phobia, but this ranged from total piteousness to relatively few negative <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Three subgroups were formed on the basis of commonalities and differences of the self-descriptions which were observed: the other-oriented (n = 7), the isolated (n = 7) and the self-demanding (n = 3). These subgroups describe the different strategies that certain socially phobic persons habitually use when compensating for their social anxiety. In Study II, the treatment progress of clients from these three subgroups was explored, using qualitative assimilation analysis. Some similarities and some differences can be noted, although the clients progressed in their assimilation process to different degrees. The largest variance was in the isolated subgroup, as there were both successful and unsuccessful therapeutic change processes. Study III indicated that reflexivity seems to be a necessary condition for progress in early phases of the therapy process, {{but it is important to}} note that reflexivity can appear in diverse forms and at different levels. It appeared to be necessary for the therapist to work inside the client’s therapeutic zone of proximal development (ZPD), since premature exposure to the therapist’s conclusions, meant to increase the client’s reflexivity, can be counterproductive. At this early assimilation stage, the client requires empathy prior to other interventions. The research as a whole emphasizes the challenges a therapist encounters when treating socially phobic clients with differing needs in a group format. Socially phobic clients may differ in many ways, including their compensatory strategies. Thus, a therapist’s responsiveness and ability to work inside the therapeutic ZPD is necessary for successful therapeutic progress...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It is a {{well known}} fact that {{children}} suffer from pain due to treatment and procedures {{in health care and}} historically, their procedural pain due to medical treatment has been undertreated and under-recognized. Children’s understanding of pain and their ability to express their feelings depend on their stage of development and the nature and diversity of their prior pain experiences. The goal of pain management is to reduce pain, distress and anxiety, and the nurse is the key person to help and support the child in pain. Nurses’ professional competence form the foundation for pain management procedures, and {{there is a need to}} investigate whether the care and procedures nurses perform for children in pain lead to desired outcomes. Aim: The overall purpose was to describe nurses’ competence in pain management in children. The specific aims were to - identify and describe knowledge about and attitudes to pain and pain management - identify factors influencing pain management in children and - describe nurses’ experiences of caring for children in pain. Methods and material: Forty-two nurses participated in a survey on knowledge about and attitudes to pain management in children, and 21 nurses were interviewed about their experiences fromcaring for children in pain. All the data were analyzed using approved methods of analysis. Results: The results showed that the nurses had good knowledge about and positive attitudes to pain management in children. Collaboration with physicians was considered important in providing children with sufficient pain relief. Parents were regarded as a resource, and the nurses described communication with parents as important. The nurses’ own experience led to a better understanding of the children’s situation. The nurses stated that pain is a subjective experience and that if a child says he or she is in pain they should be believed. Pain was seen as a complex phenomenon, and the nurses had difficulty distinguishing between pain of different origins. In predictable situations, when the child had a clear medical diagnosis with physical pain and the child’s pain followed an expected pattern, the nurses trusted their knowledge and knew how to act. On the other hand, in unpredictable situations, when the child did not respond to the treatment despite all efforts, this created <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> fear and abandonment, and even distrust. Conclusions: The conclusions of this thesis are that pain management in children is a challenge for clinical nurses in unpredictable situations. Professional competence in nursing deals with both personal abilities and the organization. Reflective practices and dialogues with colleagues would improve nurses’ work satisfaction, and guidelines and better routines would improve nurses’ pain management when caring for children...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades intense debates have taken place, in the mass media, {{regarding}} the child-parent relation within sport. Questions have been raised if parent’s involvement can {{be a source of}} pressure for children and youth. In Sweden relatively little research have been undertaken to study this problem. Therefore the aim of this thesis is: - to describe and analyse children’s and youth’s experiences of parental involvement within the sport milieu, focusing on parental pressure. The purpose has also led to the following formulated problems: - How do children and youth experience parent’s presence, actions and open reactions toward young athletes in the sport milieu? - What does it mean for young athletes to experience parental pressure? Parents can unintentionally impose pressure on children just by trying too hard to be a good sport parent. Earlier research has proposed that young athletes experience pressure from parents when there is an imbalance between the experienced intensity in the parental involvement and what they desire. Given this background parental pressure was defined as: young athlete’s experiences <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in sport, which is emanated from parent’s, both hidden and outspoken, demands and expectations to achieve within the sport milieu”. For this thesis a critical factor in the theoretical framework is young athlete’s subjective experiences of parents, and especially parental pressure, in the public sport milieu. The data collection consisted of both questionnaires and interviews. The respondents (n= 601, age 8 to 16) were selected from twelve of the most popular sports for children and youth (football, handball, swimming, equestrian sport, tennis, floor hockey, athletics, golf, ice hockey, gymnastics, figure skating and table tennis. The data from the interviews was collected from a sample of twelve young athletes (age 10 to 14). The results showed support for how children in general are happy and satisfied with their parent’s involvement (81 %). However it was also found that there was a minority group of 19 % that indicated experiences of high parental pressure. In the results there were also tendencies that showed how certain sports (tennis, swimming, golf and equestrian sport) scored higher on the parental pressure scale than others. The respondents who scored low (under the mean) on the self-perception scale showed tendencies to score high on the parental pressure scale (Rho= -. 38, p<. 01). The factors connected to parental pressure, highlighted in the interviews, were also emphasized in an open-ended question. Stronger guiding principles, reinforced motivation and designed education dealing with these subjects in organised sport are inevitable. Otherwise organised youth sport will never succeed in oppressing the primary sources of children’s experiences of parental pressure...|$|R

40|$|One {{challenge}} in the Western world is the risk of functional impairmentand chronic disease accompanying older age. In Norway it is expected thatmost chronically ill older persons will continue to live at home and receivehelp from home nursing care. The inner strength of the oldest old, as seenin relation to the help that is given, and whether the help has contributed tostrengthen the will to live has been explored only to a limited extent. Meaning in life and daily routines {{can be related to}} the will to live,understood as enjoying life and having the courage to live. The aim of thisstudy is to develop knowledge in regard to chronically ill oldest olderpersons and the possibilities and limitations in their will to live when theyreceive help from home nursing care. This study uses the quantitative method (n= 120, Article 1 and Article 2) todescribe the characteristics of inner strength using the questionnairesResilience Scale, Sense of Coherence Scale, Purpose in Life Test, and Self-Transcendence Scale. Inner strength was seen in relation to mental andphysical health using the questionnaire SF- 36. The qualitative method wasused to illuminate how the oldest older persons experienced living at homewith chronic illness (n= 13, Article 3) and receiving help from home nursingcare (n= 11, Article 4). The {{participants in this study were}} 80 years old orolder, living at home with chronic illnesses, and receiving help from homenursing care. All participants were determined to have the mental capacityto take part in this study. The analysis showed in Article 1 that the oldest old had an inner strengthexpressed as ”sense of coherence” and ”purpose in life. ” Their innerstrength was accompanied by the ability for self-transcendence. Mentalhealth was predicted by self-transcendence (p < 0. 001) for the total sampleand for women. Physical health was predicted by self-transcendence (p < 0. 01) for the total sample. Low resilience contributed to vulnerability for theparticipants. They were vulnerable in terms of limited perseverance, selfreliance,and existential aloneness (Article 2). On the contrary, theyexperienced equanimity and meaning. Meaning in daily life (Article 3) sometimes meant <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and dependency. In contrast,they also experienced joy in life, gratitude for living at home, and aneagerness to participate in activities that made them feel alive. Theyexperienced both good and bad days, which depended on their illness butwas also based on how their needs for help and support were met. InviiArticle 4, receiving help indicated different experiences. Being ill anddependent on help led to days with illness, treatment, and receiving care. Italso indicated they were in need of professional help. Receiving help couldmean being at the mercy of helpers, which could imply unworthy help, asthey had no influence on the help they got from incompetent nurses whofocused only on tasks, with limited flexibility in their work, using theirhomes as a working place. This situation of receiving help from busynurses caused the old person to feel inferior as a human being. Other timesit meant receiving help from nurses who took care with respect to the oldperson and confirmed him or her as a human being. The older personswanted to be seen, met, and supported to strengthen their courage to meetthe challenges of being old and ill. According to the ethics of caring, human beings are vulnerable andmutually dependent on each other. This influences the possibilities andlimitations of ”the other” in experiencing a will to live. ”Receiving theother” can contribute to the will to live, influenced by the help received inan asymmetric dependency in which the nurses are caught in the tensionbetween suffering and the will to live for the oldest older person in need ofhelp. In this tension, the will to live is dependent on help that is given in arelationship characterized by caring and responsibility for the other...|$|R
