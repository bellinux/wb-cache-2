5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

5|$|In November 1960, Thi led the paratroopers in a coup against Diệm, citing {{political}} {{interference in the}} military. The rebels gained the upper hand but Thi was reluctant to push <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> victory, and the coup was defeated after Diệm falsely promised to make reforms in order to buy time for loyalists to rescue him. Thi fled into exile in Cambodia, but returned after Diệm was deposed and executed in November 1963. He became the deputy commander of I Corps under Nguyễn Khánh, and helped his superior to overthrow Diệm's subjugators three months later. Thi became {{the commander of the}} 1st Division, before taking control of I Corps later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> recovery.|$|E

A p-adic proof is also given, {{which leads to}} further q-divisibility of the poles or equivalently an improvement of the polar part of the Ax-Katz theorem <b>for</b> <b>an</b> affine <b>complete</b> intersection. Similar results hold <b>for</b> <b>a</b> projective <b>complete</b> intersection...|$|R

5|$|The American artist Miriam C. Rice pioneered {{research}} into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting {{in the late}} 1960s, she discovered mushroom dyes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, have discovered sources for true blues (Sarcodon squamosus) and mossy greens (Hydnellum geogenium). Hypholoma fasciculare provides a yellow dye, and fungi such as Phaeolus schweinitzii and Pisolithus tinctorius are used in dyeing textiles and paper.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 {{aircraft}} in 2003 {{to use in}} both the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of the rotor and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman's AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> surface-to-bottom mine detection capability, as well as Mk-104 acoustic mine sweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing.

The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
