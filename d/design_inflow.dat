40|$|Climate {{change has}} led to non-stationarity in {{recorded}} floods all over the world. Although previous studies have widely discussed the design error caused by non-stationarity, most of them explored basins with closed catchment areas. The response of flood level to nonstationary inflow floods and high tidal levels in deltas with a dense river network has hardly been mentioned. Delta areas are extremely vulnerable to floods. To establish reliable standards for flood protection in delta areas, {{it is crucial to}} investigate the response of flood level to nonstationary inflow floods and high tidal levels. Pearl River Delta (PRD), the largest delta in South China, was selected as the study area. A theoretical framework was developed to quantify the response of flood level to nonstationary inflow floods and the tidal level. When the non-stationarity was ignored, error up to 18 % was found in 100 -year <b>design</b> <b>inflow</b> floods and up to 14 % in 100 -year design tidal level. Meanwhile, flood level in areas that were ≤ 22 km away from the outlets mainly responded to the nonstationary tidal level, and that ≥ 45 km to the nonstationary inflow floods. This study will support research on the non-stationarity of floods in delta areas...|$|E
40|$|This PhD study {{focuses on}} the impact of climate change on {{hydropower}} systems and dam safety. The impact studies are based on hydrological and hydraulic models, and hydropower simulation model driven by scenarios from an Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). High-resolution regional climate model (RCM) data for precipitation and temperature were used to generate climate input to the hydrological model. The study on the hydropower system provides a detailed analysis of a complex high-head system with multiple reservoirs and transfers. Results indicate that changes in the seasonality of runoff with a decrease in summer and an increase in autumn, winter, and spring. The seasonal change in runoff is strongly linked to changes in the snow cover. Projections based on the climate scenarios indicate an average increase in annual inflow to the system, and the hydropower simulation based on average climate conditions show an increase in energy generation under the current reservoir operation strategies. Conversely, the impact of climate change might come more from extreme weather events than the average conditions and thus the analysis has also considers whether the extreme conditions during the summer season in the form of prolonged droughts could potentially create a serious stress in the reservoirs and power production. The results show that the projected changes in drought duration and deficit volume will increase for the future climate. However, when compared with the total annual storage potential of the reservoirs, the increase in drought duration and deficit volume will not affect the power production or the reservoir operation. The safety of the hydropower dams for climate change scenarios has also been thoroughly investigated in this PhD study. The dam safety evaluation has been based on both standards and risk based approaches. Results from the standard based safety evaluations are taken as a basis for the risk analysis study. Furthermore, a dam failure consequence analysis is conducted as a continuation of the risk analysis study. The standards based dam safety evaluation incorporates investigating changes in design floods due to climate change compared to the historical design flood values. The design flood is routed through the reservoir and the outflow flood and reservoir water level is determined. Then, the safety of the dams for the future climate is based on the evaluation of changes in design floods and the freeboard available to accommodate the increase in the flood levels. The results from the studies indicate that the design floods with the corresponding outflow floods and flood water levels will increase in the future, and this increase will affect the safety of the dams in the future. Then, the risk analysis approach is used to evaluate the most significant contributors to risk in addition to the increase in the <b>design</b> <b>inflow</b> flood as spillway blockage and waves due to landslide. The detailed risk based analysis is used to focus on how climate impacts influence dam safety. For the dams investigated in this study, the results from the risk analysis show that the total hydrological failure probability of the dam will increase in the future climate. The consequence analysis estimates the potential impact of climate change by simulating a dam break scenario for future extreme flooding conditions and evaluates the risk in the downstream area. The results for the study case dam indicate that the extent and depth of flood waters will increase by the future dam break scenario.

40|$|In {{light of}} the energy crisis of the early 1970 's, NASA and {{industry}} gained {{a renewed interest in}} high-speed propellers for improved propulsive efficiency and explored the idea of swirl recovery vanes (SRV) to generate a net thrust from the residual swirl in the propeller slipstream. After this first effort on the aerial application of SRV, only recently research is resumed. When a wing is introduced in the slipstream of a propeller, for instance for a wing-mounted tractor-propeller, conclusions drawn on SRV in isolated condition may not hold. The objective of this research is to gain an improved understanding of the aerodynamic interaction between the propeller and swirl recovery vanes in an isolated configuration and wing-mounted tractor arrangement in the cruise condition and in a high-thrust condition. This study is realized by performing a series of transient Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD simulations of a propeller with and without SRV in an isolated and installed configuration. Throughout this research the 6 -bladed propeller of the European APIAN project is used. Available experimental propeller performance, blade pressure and slipstream measurements are used to validate the isolated propeller CFD model. Within the limitations of fully turbulent modelling of the boundary layer by means of automatic wall functions, good agreement is found with the experimental data, including the existence of a conical separation vortex at low advance ratios. Simulated performance and slipstream results are presented of the APIAN propeller with SRV designed for the APIAN-INF test program in the DNW-LLF. PIV measurements in a plane spanned by the radial and rotation axis provide a comparison of the slipstream velocity components and vorticity. This simulation combined with the PIV measurements enables an extensive description of the structure of root and tip vortices induced by the propeller blades and swirl recovery vanes. It is found that the propulsive efficiency increase by the addition of SRV is only 0. 57 % which is much lower than the design prediction of 1. 8 %. Therefore this design is not used in the remainder of the research and new SRV designs are proposed. An SRV analysis tool based on lifting-line theory modified for non-uniform inflow is presented. In combination with an optimisation routine, this tool allows for the design of SRV for an isolated propeller. From a simplified analysis of an elliptical vane in a uniform swirl flow, it is concluded that optimisation for maximum SRV thrust is preferred over complete swirl recovery to reach the highest gain in propulsive efficiency. Four designs are presented: Design 1 is optimised for the cruise condition with a constraint on stall for the high-thrust condition. Design 2 is optimised for the high-thrust condition with a constraint on the cruise condition for zero or positive efficiency benefit. These are designs where the SRV have a fixed pitch in flight. Also two variable pitch designs are proposed. The effect of cropping and the number of vanes on the propulsive efficiency is investigated as well for the objective of design 1. Design 1 and 2 are used in CFD simulations behind the isolated propeller to validate the predictions from the SRV analysis tool. In general the simulation results show that SRV lead to an increase in propulsive efficiency by increasing the system thrust over a wide range of advance ratios, with minor effect on the system power. Gains in propulsive efficiency of 0. 39 % and 0. 20 % are found in the cruise condition and 2. 62 % and 3. 07 % in the high-thrust condition for design 1 and 2 respectively. For high advance ratios the prediction is very accurate, while towards lower advance ratios the tool overpredicts the propulsive efficiency gain. The difference is within the limits that {{can be explained by the}} set assumptions. Design 1 proves that it is possible to increase the propulsive efficiency of an operating point close to the point of maximum propeller propulsive efficiency. Design 2 shows that if a larger increase in propulsive efficiency at low advance ratios is desired, the design can be changed at the cost of propulsive efficiency benefit at higher advance ratios, for a fixed SRV pitch design. Downstream of the SRV, somewhat less than half of the swirl is recovered on average. An expansion of the slipstream boundary is present, which is the result of the interaction of propeller blade and vane tip vortices. In the last part the wing of a Fokker 50 is introduced behind the propeller and SRV design 1. The loading on the wing induces an upwash upstream of the wing, resulting in a deviation from the SRV <b>design</b> <b>inflow</b> that is different for each vane by such a degree that flow separation degrades the SRV performance to a large extent. Therefore a change in the SRV design is made by turning each vane over an angle to obtain the time- and radial-average <b>design</b> <b>inflow</b> in the cruise condition. For future research it is recommended to find a different design for each vane. Since the effect of the wing upwash on the SRV inflow field varies with advance ratio and with wing loading and thus varies in flight, a variable pitch SRV design is recommended where the pitch of each vane is adjusted individually. For the cruise condition the increase in propulsive efficiency by the addition of SRV without considering differences in wing drag is found to be 0. 93 %, which is considerably higher than without wing, mainly due to the increased propeller propulsive efficiency, but partly by increased SRV thrust as well. 2. 14 % for a medium-thrust condition, which is very similar to the value without wing. For a wing-mounted tractor-propeller conclusions on SRV performance can only be drawn from the complete force balance of thrust and lift of the propeller, SRV, wing and nacelle. Considering the drag of all components, the net increase in propulsive efficiency by the addition of SRV is found to be - 0. 14 % for the cruise and 1. 00 % for the medium-thrust condition with a net increase in lift of 0. 35 % and net decrease in lift of 0. 55 % respectively. Careful optimisation of SRV taking the wing into account as well as the lift as a constraint will most likely result in a performance benefit, since already with this non-optimised design an increase in thrust or lift can be found depending on the advance ratio. The propeller slipstream greatly affects the wing lift and drag distribution by its increased axial velocity and introduced swirl. It is concluded that SRV reduce some of the effects of the propeller on the wing lift and drag distribution by a reduction of the swirl, resulting in a smaller deviation from the wing loading without propeller. A design procedure for SRV should include the wing for instance by an additional lifting line and optimise for combined SRV and wing maximum thrust with a constraint on the net lift. This may lead to SRV designs more focussed on providing the optimal inflow for the wing in order to reduce the wing drag.

40|$|Mathematical {{hydrogeology}} {{model of}} the territory of Kowsar Project was created with account {{for the results of}} the engineering surveys and hydro geological monitoring, which was conducted in the process of Kowsar Project construction. In order to create the model in the present work a universal computer system Ansys was used, which implements the finite element method and solid modeling technology, allowing to solve the filtration problem with the use of thermal analogy. The three-dimensional geometric model was built with use of the principle “hard body” modeling, which displays the main line of the territory relief, including the created water reservoir, geological structure (anticline Duk) and the main lithological complexes developed within the territory. In the limestone mass As here is a zone characterized by water permeability on territory of Kowsar Project, and a layer characterized by seepage feeding, which occurs outside the considered territory. The water reservoir is a source of the change of hydro geological situation. The results of field observations witness, that the levels of underground waters within the area of the main structures reacts almost instantly on the water level change in the water reservoir; the delay period of levels change is not more than 1, 5 … 2, 0 weeks at maximum distance from the water reservoir. These particularities of the hydro geological regime allow using the steady-state scheme of the decision of forecast problems. The mass of limestone As, containing the structures of the Kowsar Project, is not homogeneous and anisotropy in its seepage characteristics. The heterogeneity is conditioned by exogenous influence on the mass up to the depth of 100 … 150 m. The seepage anisotropy of the mass is expressed by the difference of water permeability of the mass along and across the layers for almost one order. The structures of Kowsar Project is presented by a dam, grouting curtain on axis of the dam and consolidation curtain in its both banks, drainage structures. Underground waters of the territory are formed by infiltration. They unload in river Heirabad. In accordance with this circumstance, the northwest (the right bank) and the south-east (the left bank) hydro geological borders of the model are the borders with constant discharge seepage, entering from the area of the feeding in the area of unloading. The borders are distanced from the river on 2, 5 km. In accordance with the regional direction of the flow of underground waters, the model is limited {{along the lines of the}} current (the impervious borders) at northeast (upwards on river) and south-west (down on river). Those borders are distanced from river on 2, 2 … 2, 3 km. As a result, the area of model is 28 km. Aroofing of almost watertight marls of the retinue Pb is the bottom border of the model. Theinternal borders are presented by the river Heirabad, the water reservoir and the drainage structures. The calibration of the model was conducted at the reservoir water mark of 580 m and 606 … 610 m. The correctness criterion of the decision had shown the convergence of the obtained values of discharge level of underground waters with the data of natural observations. In the process of calibration the revision of the input data was carried out - a seepage characteristic of thick limestone mass As and discharge, entering from the right and left bank borders of the model. The forecast calculation was performed for water reservoir level of 620 m. The creation of water reservoir has influenced the seepage regime of the territory by the area of more than 25 km. As a result of the buttress of the natural inflow there occurred the redistribution of the natural inflow and change of the direction of the natural inflow that has caused the appearance of springs in downstream of dam near the contact of the series As-Gs. The <b>design</b> <b>inflow</b> of underground waters in the river Heirabad on the area from dam up to the contact of the suites As and Gs in downstream is 2, 4 … 2, 6 m /s including springs.

The model, which can predict flow duration characteristic of stream, was developed to analyze the {{variation of}} inflow caused from rainfall condition. And another model to predict hydrologic performance for SSHP plants is established. Monthly inflow data measured at Andong dam for 32 years were analyzed. The existing SSHP plant located in upstream of Andong dam was selected and analyzed hydrologic performance characteristics. The predicted results from the developed models show that the data were in good agreement with measured results of long term inflow at Andong dam and the existing SSHP plant. Inflow and ideal hydro power potential had increased greatly in recent years, however, these did not lead annual energy production increment of existing SSHP plant.

40|$|Underground rock {{construction}} {{is dependent on}} appropriate assessments of the geological settings at the project site. Relevant geological information must be collected, interpreted and communicated clearly {{with the aid of}} engineering geological prognoses. The general quality of the geological prognoses can be improved if the information relates to the engineering application and the project requirements. The work presented in this thesis aims to clarify ways in which this can be taken into account in grouting design throughout the construction process. Attention has been given to geological information that can increase understanding of the hydraulic properties of the rock mass. This was done by compiling relevant geological parameters and introducing hydraulic domains to define the various expected forms of hydraulic behaviour at a project site. A fracture transmissivity distribution model was presented for evaluating the sealing efficiency of grouting measures. The distribution model was also found useful for identifying differing flow configurations in the rock mass and indicating limitations in analytical models, which could be valuable for grouting <b>design</b> and <b>inflow</b> predictions. A study was also made of the current use of geological information in grouting design in Swedish tunnel projects. The study indicated that pre-defined grouting design classes are generally adapted to differing requirements but are less clearly modified in order to suit the variation in geological settings. Hydraulic domains are suggested to be used together with stated requirements to establish grouting classes adapted to both favourable and unfavourable scenarios, which is in accordance with the observational method. It is suggested that engineering geological prognoses based on hydraulic domains are made in the early phases of a project to facilitate identification of grouting design prerequisites and reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions in later phases...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to investigate geometrical changes caused by closed-cell design stents in bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms. 31 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent SACE with closed-cell <b>design</b> stents. <b>Inflow</b> angle α, determined by aneurysm neck and afferent vessel, and angle between afferent and efferent vessel close to (δ 1), respectively, more remote from the aneurysm neck (δ 2) were graphically determined in 2 D angiography projections. Stent assisted coiling resulted in a significant increase of all three angles from a mean value (±SEM) of α = 119 ° (± 6. 5 °) pretreatment to 130 ° (± 6. 6 °) posttreatment (P ≤. 001), δ 1 = 129 ° (± 6. 4 °) to 139 ° (± 6. 1 °), (P ≤. 001) and δ 2 = 115 ° (± 8. 4 °) to 126 ° (± 7. 5 °), (P ≤. 01). Angular change of δ 1 in AcomA aneurysms was significant greater compared to sidewall aneurysms (26 °± 4. 9 ° versus 8 °± 2. 3 °, P ≤. 05). The initial angle of δ 1 and δ 2 revealed a significantly inverse relationship to the angle increase (δ 1 : r = - 0. 41, P ≤. 05 and δ 2 : r = - 0. 47, P ≤. 01). Moreover, angle δ 1 was significantly higher in unruptured compared to ruptured aneurysms (135 °± 7. 1 ° versus 103 °± 10. 8 °, P ≤. 05). Stent deployment modulates the geometry of the aneurysm-vessel complex, which may lead to favorable hemodynamic changes more similar to unruptured than to ruptured aneurysms. Our findings also suggest that the more acute-angled aneurysm-vessel anatomy, the larger the angular change. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these changes improve the clinical outcome...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of a micro-scale tidal hydrokinetic generator to power autonomous oceanographic instrumentation, with emphasis on turbine design and performance. This type of "micropower" system is intended to provide continuous power {{on the order of}} 20 Watts. System components are reviewed and include turbine, electrical generator, gearbox, controller, converter, and battery bank. A steady-state model predicts system energy storage and power output in a mixed, mainly semidiurnal tidal regime with peak currents of 1. 5 m/s. Among several turbine designs reviewed, a helical cross-flow turbine is selected, due to its self-start capability, ability to accept inflow from any direction, and power performance. Parameters impacting helical turbine design include radius, blade profile and pitch, aspect ratio, helical pitch, number of blades, solidity ratio, blade wrap ratio, strut design, and shaft diameter. The performance trade-offs of each are compared. A set of three prototype-scale turbines (two three-bladed designs, with 15 % and 30 % solidity, and a four-bladed design with 30 % solidity and higher helical pitch) and several strut and shaft configurations were fabricated and tested in a water flume capable of flow rates up to 0. 8 m/s. Tests included performance characterization of the rotating turbines from freewheel to stall, static torque characterization as a function of azimuthal angle, performance degradation associated with inclination angles up to 10 ° from vertical, and stream-wise wake velocity profiles. A four-bladed turbine with 60 ° helical pitch, 30 % solidity, and circular plate "end cap" provided the best performance; this design attained efficiency of 24 % in 0. 8 m/s flow and experienced smaller performance reductions for tilted orientations relative to other variants. Maximum turbine efficiency increased with increased flume velocity. A free-vortex model was modified to simulate the helical turbine performance. Model results were compared to experimental data for various strut <b>design</b> and <b>inflow</b> velocities, and performance was extrapolated to higher flume velocities and a full-scale turbine (0. 7 m 2 relative to 0. 04 m 2 in flume tests). The model predicts experimental trends correctly but deviates from experimental values for some conditions, indicating the need for further study of secondary effects for a high chord-to-radius ratio turbine...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{mathematical}} modelling {{and the availability}} of high speed computers with considerable memory size is making it possible to study the hydraulics of border irrigation in a greater depth than every before. A zero inertia mathematical model was found to be reliable and inexpensive among the models available in border irrigation hydraulics and was used for this study to simulate free outflow flowing border irrigation. Special emphasis was given to the runoff produced from such a system. This study dealt particularly with, the identification of pertinent open channel variables affecting runoff in border irrigation, presentation of predictive graphical and mathematical solution to quantify runoff, and with utilization of these solutions in developing reuse system <b>design</b> criteria. <b>Inflow</b> rate, surface resistance, border slope, soil infiltration characteristics, application time (time of cutoff and length of run of the border) were among other variables studied. As one might expect, runoff was found to increase with slope, flow rate, application time and decrease with increase in infiltration rate, length of run and bed and vegetation drag. Considering the number of variables affecting runoff characteristics from a given irrigation, it was obvious to see a thorough examination of each variable in dimensional terms was practically impossible. Also, presentation of the results would have required too many graphs. Dimensional anslysis was used to solve this problem and in developing dimensionless runoff curves. The ability to quantify runoff made it possible to develop reuse system design formula for proper sizing of reuse systems under several operational requirements. Shape function for the ultimate infiltrated depth profile was used to get times of runoff and also calculate various efficiencies which are useful for evaluating the system. The study shows, through the use of reuse system, the potential application efficiency can be changed from present values of 60 percent to 90 percent in Arizona. It also can be used to demonstrate the saving in energy that can be realized through such system. Step by step procedures for the design of reuse system using graphical and mathematical solutions are presented with a sample problem worked out. It is expected that the result of this study can be used by designers as well as operators of border irrigation systems without any difficulty {{with the aid of a}} simple pocket calculator. Other uses of the study include getting optimal design for the system itself by evaluating various possible designs and classroom instruction on the application of dimensional analysis to open channel hydraulics problems and design of reuse systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{tunnel system}} for the Combined Sewer Overflow. Abatement Project (CSOAP) for the City of Rochester, New York, {{requires}} numerous control structures. Site 45 is the designated name and location of one such control structure. It {{is located on the}} west bank of the Genesee River and receives flow from the Lake Avenue Tunnel and the Tiger Carlisle Tunnel. The Site 45 control structure performs three functions. First, it contains a centrally located chamber which provides relief from waterhammer and surge pressures that will occur in the tunnels as a result of stormwater inflows. Second, if the inflow volume is great enough, the structure provides overflow relief by directing excess stormwater to two dropshafts which lead to the Genesee River below. Third, the structure controls the rate of flow through two parallel conduits which cross over to the east side of the Genesee River, and to additional structures located downstream, including the Frank E. Van Lare Sewage Treatment Plant. The control structure at Site 45 is designed to pass up to 375 cfs across the Genesee River to the Van Lare Treatment Plant. Flows greater than 375 cfs will exceed the capacity of the treatment plant and will be directed via the overflow relief to the Genesee River. The <b>design</b> maximum <b>inflow</b> to the Site 45 structure is 3000 cfs. Control of the rate of flow to the sewage treatment plant will be accomplished by means of control gates within the Site 45 structure. The gate openings will be set automatically to pass a given flow with a range· of head differences. These head differences are dependent on the water surface elevation in the surge chamber within the structure and the head required to establish a specific flow to the sewage treatment plant. A model of the Site 45 structure was built at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory from drawings of the proposed structure supplied by Harza Engineering Company (Dwg. 1330 HYD 4500 RJ). Figures 1 and 2 show the plan and elevation of the structure obtained from these drawings. Photographs of the model are shown in Photos 1 and 2. The details of the specific parts of the model will be explained as the functions of the various components are discussed. Froude law scaling was used to establish dynamic similarity between the model and prototype, as gravity is the dominant force producing motion. The following expressions were used to convert the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic quantities from the model to the prototype. Division of Pure Water...|$|R
40|$|Dam break {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} investigating future effects posed to human life and property by a sudden release of water to the inundation area of a dam. Every constructed as well as proposed dams need to be analyze {{for the possibility of}} dam break because even with advanced technology,failure cannot be rooted out based on the huge level risks associated with it. This study aims at establishing the worst-case scenario at the Mt. Coffee dam as a result of overtopping. The impacts are determined using numerical 1 -dimensional software (MIKE 11). The flood condition is prompted by the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) of the basin which is inputted as a time dependent external boundary condition into the reservoir. Accuracy in this study is vital to instituting foundation for further investigations on Emergency Action Plan and Risk Management among others. Efficient dam break analysis relies on high precision of breach parameter. To arrive at this result,two widely used and well recommended breach prediction parameter methods are used in this research. The Federal Energy Regulatory Committee (FERC) and Froelich- 2008 regression breach prediction methods are compared to yield outflow hydrographs,travel time of flood from the onset of the overtop to downstream locations,travel time from peak outflow to inhabited locations downstream,velocity of flood,water levels,and attenuation in discharge downstream of the dam break. The sensitivity of the breach is also tested by interchanging prediction parameters such as breach width,breach formation time,and breach slope channel. By establishing the <b>inflow</b> <b>design</b> flood,it has been proven that the Mount Coffee dam has a high possibility of failure due to the inadequacy of spillway capacity...|$|R
