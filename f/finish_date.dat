25|$|Route106 near Little Long Pond {{was closed}} in March 2008 {{due to the}} failure of a culvert between Little Long Pond and Lake Kanawauke. Route106 was closed off in the area, {{with the rest of the}} road open for hikers. However, the road was not going to be {{connected}} again until summer of 2008. People are also allowed to walk in the area. Although the projected date of the summer of 2008 passed, the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and Orange County Department of Highways did not open the highway. On April3, 2009, over one year since the closing of the highway, the Commission, Department of Highways (in conjunction with the New York State Department of Transportation) reported that the construction to fix the safety concerns near Little Long Pond would cost $300,000 (2009 USD). The construction report said the probable <b>finish</b> <b>date</b> for the project is December1, 2009. The construction was, in fact, completed in December 2009 which also included the reconstruction of a second culvert connecting the northern and southern portions of Lake Kanawauke, located approximately 1/2 mile east of the failed culvert.|$|E

[...] The work proved to be challenging, with a large number of culverts having to be installed and high levels of insurgent activity in the area.

500|$|The {{presence}} {{and influence of}} L'ange is evident in Donizetti's autograph score of La favorite, which features [...] "large chunks" [...] of L'ange [...] "cut up and interleaved" [...] in which new character names and text for La favorite overwrite the old. The final page of L'ange {{was used as the}} final page of La favorite; therefore, both operas bear the same <b>finish</b> <b>date</b> on the last page. Donizetti's contract for La favorite demanded a 1 December 1840 premiere, leaving him little time for dramatic changes. In his 1965 biography Donizetti, Ashbrook surmises that this tight deadline gave rise to the legend that Donizetti actually composed the last act of La favorite in a single night. In fact, the libretto of L'ange and the autograph score of La favorite make clear that the final act of La favorite was completed long before Donizetti began the rest of it in September—Donizetti lifted it from L'ange with the exception of two solo passages. He brought in librettist Eugène Scribe to oversee the new text, which also required the approval of starring mezzo-soprano Rosine Stoltz. The finished product was an amalgamation of the unfinished Adelaide, the never-performed L'ange de Nisida, and new material worked into the score by Donizetti and into the libretto by Scribe. La favorite premiered on 2 December 1840.|$|E
