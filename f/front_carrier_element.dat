30|$|The {{selectivity}} of 8 -hydroxyquinoline (8 -HQ) for metal ions can {{be enhanced}} if combined with Fe 2 O 3 and anchored on chitosan using epichlorohydrin as a crosslinking agent. A bio-based 8 -HQ anchored magnetic chitosan using Co(II) as imprinted ions and epichlorohydrin as crosslinking agent has successfully been applied for selective removal of cobalt ion relative to nickel and lead ions from water and food samples (Beyki et al. 2016). This procedure can offer the advantage of highly effective separation of metal ions in magnetic field. However, it is expensive compared to the proposed coprecipitation procedure in this study for which magnetic nanoparticles and chitosan are not in use. The use of chelating agent with <b>carrier</b> <b>element</b> alone in coprecipitation technique is much more convenient, inexpensive and can readily be adopted in the preconcentration of metal ions (Yıldız et al. 2016). 8 -HQ was identified as the main functional group in the composite structure, which {{played an important role}} in cobalt ion removal from solution (Beyki et al. 2016). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of some heavy metal ions in Lagos lagoon water using co-precipitation procedure involving 8 -hydroxyquinoline and Cu(II) solution as precipitating agent and <b>carrier</b> <b>element,</b> respectively. The metal concentrations of water sample treated with 8 -hydoxyquinoline was subsequently employed to evaluate the metal pollution load of the lagoon water.

30|$|Co-precipitation {{procedure}} has widely {{been employed}} for preconcentration and separation of metal ions from the matrices of environmental samples. This is simply {{due to its}} simplicity, low consumption of separating solvent and short duration for analysis. Various organic ligands {{have been used for}} this purpose. However, there is dearth of information on the application of 8 -hydroxyquinoline (8 -HQ) as ligand and Cu(II) as <b>carrier</b> <b>element.</b> The use of Cu(II) is desirable because there is no contamination and background adsorption interference. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} use 8 -HQ in the presence of Cu(II) for coprecipitation of Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Ni(II) and Pb(II) from standard solutions and surface water prior to their determinations by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The effects of pH, sample volume, amount of 8 -HQ and Cu(II) and interfering ions on the recoveries of metal ions from standard solutions were monitored using FAAS. The water samples were treated with 8 -HQ under the optimum experimental conditions and metal concentrations were determined by FAAS. The metal concentrations in water samples not treated with 8 -HQ were also determined. The optimum recovery values for metal ions were higher than 85.0 %. The concentrations (mg/L) of Co(II), Ni(II), Cr(III), and Pb(II) in water samples treated with 8 -HQ were 0.014  ±  0.002, 0.03  ±  0.01, 0.04  ±  0.02 and 0.05  ±  0.02, respectively. These concentrations and those obtained without coprecipitation technique were significantly different. Coprecipitation procedure using 8 -HQ as ligand and Cu(II) as <b>carrier</b> <b>element</b> enhanced the preconcentration and separation of metal ions from the matrix of water sample.|$|R

The quantitative recoveries of analyte ions were high (> 85 %) at the optimal experimental conditions. The separation of metal ions from the matrix of water sample was enhanced when the sample was treated with precipitating ligand. This procedure {{can be applied to}} various kinds of environmental samples. The reason is that FAAS provides an effective, cheap, rapid and reliable technique for the determination of analyte ions in environmental samples.|$|R
