25|$|Today St Buryan {{primary school}} teaches pupils {{between the ages}} of four and eleven and is a feeder school for nearby Cape Cornwall School. There was, until recently, an {{attached}} nursery for children of pre-school age, but this has subsequently moved to new premises in the village. For many years the school taught in its original three classrooms. Under the headship of Paul Gazzard, however, the site has been expanded to include a fourth classroom, a hall and gymnasium, a library and a new reception area. This expansion was made financially possible in part due to a spell as a grant maintained school in which the school had direct control over its own budget. Under the School Standards and <b>Framework</b> <b>Act</b> 1998 the school became a foundation school.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{was one of}} {{the last}} Western {{countries}} to adopt the MBA degree. In 1998, the Hochschulrahmengesetz (Higher Education <b>Framework</b> <b>Act),</b> a German federal law regulating higher education including the types of degrees offered, was modified to permit German universities to offer master's degrees. The traditional German degree in business administration was the Diplom in Betriebswirtschaft (Diplom-Kaufmann) but since 1999, bachelor's and master's degrees have gradually replaced the traditional degrees due to the Bologna process. Today most German business schools offer the MBA. Most German states require that MBA degrees have to be accredited by one of the six agencies officially recognized by the German Akkreditierungsrat (accreditation council), the German counterpart to the American CHEA. The busiest of these six agencies (in respect to MBA degrees) is the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA). All universities themselves have to be institutionally accredited by the state (staatlich anerkannt).|$|E

[...] Under the Labour government's School Standards and <b>Framework</b> <b>Act</b> 1998, grammar schools were for the first time to be designated by statutory instrument. The Act also defined a procedure by which local communities could petition for a ballot for an end to selection at schools. Petitions were launched in several areas, but only one received the signatures of 20% of eligible parents, the level needed to trigger a ballot. Thus the only ballot held to date was for Ripon Grammar School in 2000, when parents rejected change by a ratio of 2 to 1. These arrangements were condemned by the Select Committee for Education and Skills as being ineffective and a waste of time and resources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an {{architecture}} {{to interact with}} a system called Kenzo is described. Kenzo is a Common Lisp system devoted to mathematical symbolic com-putation, namely {{in the area of}} Algebraic Topology. The architecture presented in this paper is an evolution of a previous proposal, where several aspects have been improved. In particular, we have now uncoupled the different components, and imple-mented mechanisms to reuse intermediary computations. The new technology allowing us these improvements is based on the Linda Model (a model where processes com-municate by means of a shared tuple space), implemented through AllegroCache (an object oriented database for Allegro Common Lisp). The developed <b>framework</b> <b>acts</b> as a middleware between some Kenzo clients and Kenzo itself...|$|R

Finally, we highlight the need to understand the local institutional context in terms of the characteristics of buyers, sellers, and their relationship for implementation to be effective.
