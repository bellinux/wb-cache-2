At that time he began studying the life of prayer and asceticism under his guidance, {{with the desire to}} immediately enter the monastery.

5|$|In Pondicherry, Aurobindo {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} <b>his</b> <b>spiritual</b> and philosophical pursuits.

It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living.

He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked <b>his</b> <b>spiritual</b> conversion.

5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering <b>his</b> <b>spiritual</b> father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century {{commentary}} in the Zhoubi suanjing describes two astronomical theories: in one, {{the heavens}} are shaped as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, {{while the other}} compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where the heavens are shaped as a celestial sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his Model Sayings (Fayan 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in <b>his</b> <b>Spiritual</b> Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) of 120 CE. Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a geocentric model for the immediate solar system and greater universe, {{as opposed to a}} heliocentric model.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being {{performed}} in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses <b>his</b> <b>spiritual</b> journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.|$|E

5|$|Hazrath Shahul Hamid Badusha Kaadiri {{was born}} to Syed Hassan Kuthos Baba Kaadiri and Bibi Fathima at Manikpur, in Pratapgarh {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh.

5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits.

Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.|$|E
