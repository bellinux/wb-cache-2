50|$|Defense Update {{released}} {{an analysis of}} the tank in May 2015, speculating that Afghanits main sensors are the four panels mounted on the turrets sides, which are probably AESA radar panes spread out for a 360° view, with possibly one more on top of the turret. In their opinion, the active part of the system consists of both a hard kill and soft kill element, the first of which actively destroys an incoming projectile (such as an unguided rocket or artillery shell), while the second confuses the guidance systems of ATGMs, causing them to lose target lock. They believe that it would be effective against 3rd and 4th generation ATGMs, including Hellfire, TOW, BILL, Javelin, Spike, Brimstone, and JAGM, as well as sensor-fused weapons (SFW). Some Russian sources claim the hard-kill APS is effective even against depleted uranium-cored armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds traveling at , but others are skeptical, saying the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>charge</b> would not do much to the dense penetrator; while it might be able to push it off course somewhat with a hit-to-kill approach, it likely wont do much to stop it.|$|E

50|$|The Douglas-built missile was a {{two-stage}} missile using a {{solid fuel}} booster stage and a liquid fueled (IRFNA/UDMH) second stage. The missile could reach a maximum speed of 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h), {{an altitude of}} 70,000 ft (21 km) and had a range of 25 miles (40 km). The missile contained an unusual three part payload, with explosive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>charges</b> at three points {{down the length of}} the missile to help ensure a lethal hit. The missile's limited range was seen by critics as a serious flaw, because it often meant that the missile had to be situated very close to the area it was protecting.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMass {{spectrometry}} of charged derivatives of peptides {{has been}} a growing area {{of interest in the}} past decade. <b>Fragmentation</b> of <b>charged</b> derivatives of peptides is believed to be different from than that of protonated peptides when analyzed by collisionally activated dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (CAD-MS/MS). The charged derivatives fragment by charge-remote fragmentation mechanisms, which are usually classified as high-energy (HE) -CAD processes. Our objective in the present study is to investigate the mechanism of <b>fragmentation</b> of <b>charged</b> derivatives of peptides when analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-postsource decay-mass spectrometry (MALDI-PSD-MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI) -CAD-MS/MS (ion trap), which involve low-energy processes. Three major types of hydrogens (α, β, and amide) are available for migration during the formation of the ∗an ions (the predominant ion series produced from these charged derivatives). To pinpoint which of the three hydrogens is involved {{in the formation of the}} ∗an ions, deuterium-labeled peptide derivatives with labels at specific sites were synthesized and analyzed by MALDI-PSD-MS and ESI-CAD-MS/MS. Our results suggest that the amide hydrogen of the residue at which the cleavage occurs shifts during the formation of ∗an; this observation serves as evidence for the mechanism proposed earlier by Liao et al. for <b>fragmentation</b> of such <b>charged</b> derivatives. The results also help elucidate the structure of the ∗an ions, ∗bn ions, and others formed during cleavage at the proline residue, as well as the ions formed during loss of the C-terminal residue from these charged derivatives...|$|R
40|$|A new {{modeling}} and experimentation methodology for assessing fragmentation characteristics of blast-enhanced explosive fragmentation munitions had been developed. Fragmentation performance of two high explosive compositions had been {{examined in this}} work: a baseline, PBXN- 9 (92 % HMX, 6 % Dioctyl adipate, 2 % Hycar 4454) explosive, and an aluminized blast-enhanced PAX-Al composition. The experimental assessment of the fragmentation performance of tested charges was accomplished using the fragmentation arena tests, the sawdust fragment recovery experimentation, and the flash-screen fragment velocity tests. The analytical assessment of the thermodynamic parameters of the PBXN- 9 and the PAX-Al compositions was performed employing the JAGUAR code. The analytical assessment of the fragmentation parameters of the explosive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>charges</b> was performed employing the PAFRAG (Picatinny Arsenal Fragmentation) modeling methodology linking the three-dimensional axial symmetric high-strain high-strain-rate hydrocode analyses with a phenomenological fragmentation model based on the Mott’s theory of break-up of ideal cylindrical “ring-bombs”.

50|$|Factors {{affecting}} <b>fragmentation</b> are the <b>charge</b> state (the higher charge state, {{the less}} energy {{is needed for}} fragmentation), mass of the peptide (the larger mass, the more energy is required), induced energy (higher energy leads to more fragmentation), primary amino acid sequence, mode of dissociation and collision gas.|$|R

40|$|Stability and {{fragmentation}} {{patterns of}} multicharged aggregates of sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) -sulfosuccinate (NaAOT) in gas phase {{have been investigated}} by ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Positively doubly charged NaAOT aggregates show at low collision energy a preference {{for the loss of}} NaAOT molecules, whereas <b>fragmentation</b> through <b>charge</b> separation process is favored at higher collision energy. By increasing the charge state of the aggregates, the <b>fragmentation</b> through <b>charge</b> separation tends to predominate especially at low aggregation number and only <b>charge</b> separation <b>fragmentation</b> is observed for positively quadruply charged species. On the other hand, the fragmentation of negatively doubly charged NaAOT aggregates is always characterized by a structural collapse of the entire ensemble leading to the formation of small-size singly charged fragments. The analysis of the collision energy required to fragment the 50 % (CE 50 %) of positively and negatively charged NaAOT aggregates allows to emphasize the role of electrostatic repulsion, degree of freedom and statistical effects as determining factors of the aggregation number and charge state dependence of CE 50 % values. Overall, the observed behavior of positively and negatively multicharged NaAOT aggregates in gas phase has been rationalized in terms of the electrostatic interactions between sodium counterions and negatively charged surfactant heads mainly responsible of the reverse-micelle like structural arrangement of these non-covalent aggregates and of their stability...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of jet fragmentation functions in p+p collisions at 200 GeV {{is of great}} interest because it provides a baseline to study jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

Therefore, a systematic study of the <b>fragmentation</b> functions for <b>charged</b> hadrons and identified particles is a goal both in p+p and Au+Au collisions at RHIC.

An increase in nonpreferential fragmentation as well as additional low mass product ions was observed in the spectra from multiply charged precursor ions providing increased sequence coverage.

40|$|The {{observed}} limiting <b>fragmentation</b> of <b>charged</b> particle distributions {{in heavy}} ion collisions {{is difficult to}} explain as it {{does not apply to}} the proton spectrum itself. On the other hand, string percolation provides a mechanism to regenerate fast particles, eventually compensating the rapidity shift (energy loss) of the nucleons. However a delicate energy-momentum compensation is required, and in our framework we see no reason for limiting fragmentation to be exact. A prediction, based on percolation arguments, is given for the charged particle density in the full rapidity interval at LHC energy $(\sqrt s = 5500 GeV) $.
