5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, <b>dicotyledonous</b> species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E
5|$|V. thapsus is a <b>dicotyledonous</b> {{plant that}} {{produces}} a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
25|$|Investigations of Upper Cretaceous and Early Tertiary sediments of Antarctica yield a rich {{assemblage}} of well-preserved fossil <b>dicotyledonous</b> angiosperm wood which provides {{evidence for the}} existence, since the Late Cretaceous, of temperate forests similar in composition {{to those found in}} present-day southern South America, New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania. It is suggested a paleobotanical habitat similar to the extant cool temperate Valdivian rainforests.|$|E
25|$|Many hostplants are known, {{generally}} <b>dicotyledonous</b> {{trees or}} shrubs. Patterns of hostplant shifting have been inferred for many United Kingdom {{species in the}} genus Phyllonorycter and its sister genus Cameraria (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2003). A recent DNA sequencing study mainly of Palaearctic species {{has shown that the}} burst of evolutionary adaptive radiation occurred long after that of the larval hostplants, rather than demonstrating a tight coevolutionary process (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2006).|$|E
25|$|The insect is {{regarded}} as an herbivorous generalist, and the larvae feed on numerous horticultural crops in Australia and New Zealand, where they have limited natural predators. It is known to feed on 123 <b>dicotyledonous</b> plant species, including 22 Australian natives, belonging to 55 different families. In New Zealand, over 250 host species have been recorded. It feeds on nearly all types of fruit crops, ornamentals, vegetables, glasshouse crops, and occasionally young pine seedlings.|$|E
25|$|BCTV {{has been}} known to affect more than 300 plant species from 44 {{different}} families. Sugar beets are known to be the main host for this virus but it also affect many plants including beans, celery, spinach, melons, peppers, squashes, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Younger plants seem to be more susceptible to damage and developed more symptoms from the virus compared to adult plants. It has been shown that the BCTV tend to infect more <b>dicotyledonous</b> hosts while no monocotyledonous plants have been recognized as a host for this virus.|$|E
25|$|Stylidium graminifolium, {{the grass}} triggerplant, is a <b>dicotyledonous</b> plant {{that belongs to}} the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). This species used {{to belong to the}} Stylidium graminifolium complex, but the name was conserved for this single species when two others were split from the complex and {{introduced}} as new species in 2001. S. graminifolium is endemic to Australia {{and is one of the}} Stylidium species with the widest distribution throughout Australia. It is a perennial plant with grass-like leaves and is easily cultivated. It has been considered to be a carnivorous or protocarnivorous plant because it possesses glandular trichomes underneath the flowers that can trap and digest prey.|$|E
25|$|Tropaeolum is a genus of <b>dicotyledonous</b> annual or {{perennial}} plants, {{often with}} somewhat succulent stems and sometimes tuberous roots. The alternate leaves are hairless, peltate and entire or palmately lobed. The petioles or leaf stalks {{are long and}} in many species are able to twine round other stems to provide support. The flowers are bisexual and showy, set singly on long stalks in the axils of the leaves. They have five sepals, the uppermost of which is elongated into a nectar spur. The five petals are clawed, with the lower three unlike the upper two. The eight stamens are in two whorls of unequal length and the superior ovary has three segments and three stigmas on a single style. The fruit is naked and nut-like, with three single seed segments.|$|E
25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne spp.) {{are one of}} {{the three}} most economically damaging genera of plant-parasitic nematodes on horticultural and field crops. Root-knot nematodes are distributed worldwide, and are obligate parasites of the roots of thousands of plant species, including monocotyledonous and <b>dicotyledonous,</b> herbaceous and woody plants. The genus includes more than 90 species, with some species having several races. Four Meloidogyne species (M. javanica, M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. hapla) are major pests worldwide, with another seven being important on a local basis. Meloidogyne occurs in 23 of 43 crops listed as having plant-parasitic nematodes of major importance, ranging from field crops, through pasture and grasses, to horticultural, ornamental and vegetable crops. If root-knot nematodes become established in deep-rooted, perennial crops, control is difficult and options are limited.|$|E
25|$|Dik-dik are herbivorous {{and their}} diets consist mainly of foliage, fruits, shoots, and berries. Due to their adaptations dik-dik are water {{independent}} {{and rely on}} vegetation {{as a source of}} water. Kirk's dik-diks are concentrate selectors, feeding selectively on <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants that can be rapidly fermented and digested. This includes leaves and fruit high in nutrients and water but low in fiber and cellulose. According to Hofmann (1973) and Hoope et al. (1983), grasses are only consumed when they are germinating and Kirk's dik-dik have stomach capacities and mass that consist of 8.5–10.0% of body mass when full and 2.2% when empty". As further explained by Hofmann (1973), because of the aforementioned facts and their high food requirements, Kirk's dik-dik feed and ruminate periodically throughout day and nighttime. Hendrichs (1975) stated that, they consume roughly 3.8% of their body mass daily.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
500|$|In his 1998 book, Interrelationship Between Insects and Plants, Pierre Jolivet only {{considered}} four {{species of}} plants to be protocarnivorous: Catopsis berteroniana, Brocchinia reducta, B. hectioides, and Paepalanthus bromeloides. Jolivet writes, [...] "It {{is important to remember}} that all carnivorous plants are dicots and all protocarnivorous plants are monocots," [...] though he does not explain why nor does he describe his reasons for excluding other <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants that are protocarnivorous.|$|E
500|$|Ornithophilous flowers {{need to be}} {{conspicuous}} to birds. Birds {{have their}} greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum, so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may {{also be able to}} see ultraviolet [...] "colors". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers. Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the Phaethornithinae (hermits) and the Trochilinae, has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer <b>dicotyledonous</b> plant species.|$|E
500|$|Stylidium (also {{known as}} triggerplants or trigger plants) is a genus of <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants {{that belong to}} the family Stylidiaceae. The genus name Stylidium {{is derived from the}} Greek στύλος or stylos (column or pillar), which refers to the {{distinctive}} reproductive structure that its flowers possess. Pollination is achieved through the use of the sensitive [...] "trigger", which comprises the male and female reproductive organs fused into a floral column that snaps forward quickly in response to touch, harmlessly covering the insect in pollen. Most of the approximately 300 species are only found in Australia, making it the fifth largest genus in that country. Triggerplants are considered to be protocarnivorous or carnivorous because the glandular trichomes that cover the scape and flower can trap, kill, and digest small insects with protease enzymes produced by the plant.|$|E
2500|$|A. mirabilis {{exhibits}} two characteristics shared only by A. bidwillii among extant Araucaria species. First is {{the separate}} {{origins of the}} vascular bundles of the bract and fertile scales; second is the highly vascularized [...] "ligule". They also both have <b>dicotyledonous</b> embryos. On this basis, A. mirabilis is classified as belonging to the section Bunya.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sweet potato}} (Ipomoea batatas) is a <b>dicotyledonous</b> plant {{that belongs to}} the {{bindweed}} or morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. [...] Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are a root vegetable. The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens. The sweet potato is only distantly related to the potato (Solanum tuberosum) and {{does not belong to}} the nightshade family, Solanaceae, but both families belong to the same taxonomic order, the Solanales.|$|E
2500|$|Dahlia [...] ( [...] or [...] ) is a genus of bushy, tuberous, {{herbaceous}} {{perennial plants}} native to Mexico. A {{member of the}} Asteraceae (or Compositae), <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants, related species include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia. There are 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants. Flower forms are variable, with one head per stem; these can be as small as [...] diameter or up to [...] ("dinner plate"). This great variety results from dahlias being octoploids—that is, they have eight sets of homologous chromosomes, whereas most plants have only two. In addition, dahlias also contain many transposons—genetic pieces that move {{from place to place}} upon an allele—which contributes to their manifesting such great diversity.|$|E
2500|$|The mature {{seeds of}} A. mirabilis are about [...] long and [...] wide. The seed {{integument}} has three layers of tissues - the sarcotesta, the thickened sclerotesta, and endotesta. It is fused to the nucellus (central {{portion of the}} ovule) only at the base. The sclerotesta (the [...] "shell") also exhibits a zigzag pattern of sclereids. The fossilized seeds are exquisitely preserved, showing both mature and immature stages. They often contain well-developed <b>dicotyledonous</b> embryos, indicating that they were capable of lying dormant. [...] The size of the cones did not indicate maturity as small cones around [...] in diameter can be found with fully formed embryos. Most of the cones have been preserved before their seeds could be dispersed. Some cones, however, do not contain embryos and the naked axes of cones have also been recovered (described by Wieland as a separate species - Proaraucaria patagonica). It is believed that A. mirabilis shed only its seeds but not the scales at maturity. Nevertheless, no separate petrified seeds or bracts have been recovered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{life history}} of Macrosoma heliconiaria was {{originally}} described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into {{the biology of}} hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably [...] "I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I {{was sure it was}} a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span a wide range of (according to the APG II system) rosid <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea). The [...] "green lizard caterpillar" [...] Macrosoma tipulata attacks an economically important local fruit tree [...] "Cupuaçu" [...] (Theobroma grandiflorum) in Brazil and can defoliate saplings; the biology of this species has been studied and illustrated in some detail. The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.|$|E

60|$|The great {{diversity}} of forms and structures at so remote an epoch would require for their development {{an amount of}} time, which, judging by {{the changes that have}} occurred in other groups, would carry us back far into the Mesozoic period. In order to understand why we have no record of these changes in any part of the world, we must fall back upon some such supposition as we made {{in the case of the}} <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants. Perhaps, indeed, the two cases are really connected, and the upland regions of the primeval world, which saw the development of our higher vegetation, may have also afforded the theatre for the gradual development of the varied mammalian types which surprise us by their sudden appearance in Tertiary times.|$|E
60|$|These {{species are}} all extinct: the six first were found by M. d'Orbigny and {{myself in the}} {{formations}} of the Rio Negro, S.

North of the Bajada, M. d'Orbigny found, in beds which he considers as lying beneath the strata here described, remains of a Toxodon, which he has named as a distinct species from the T.

There are four genera of cycads, and three extinct genera of conifers, besides Glyptostrobus and Torreya now found only in China and California, six species of true pines, and five of the genus Sequoia, one of which occurs also in Spitzbergen. The European deposits of the same age closely agree with these in their general character, conifers, cycads, and ferns forming the mass of the vegetation, while exogens are entirely absent, the above-named Greenland poplar being the oldest known <b>dicotyledonous</b> plant.[17] ...|$|E

Truth is never learned, in any department of industry, by arguing, but by working, and observing. And when you have got good hold of one truth, for certain, two others will grow out of it, in a beautifully <b>dicotyledonous</b> fashion, (which, as before noticed, is the meaning of the branch in Logic's right hand).

60|$|Ever since fossil {{plants have}} been {{collected}} and studied, the broad fact has been apparent that the early plants--those of the Coal formation--were mainly cryptogamous, while in the Tertiary deposits the higher flowering plants prevailed. In the intermediate secondary epoch the gymnosperms--cycads and coniferae--formed a prominent part of the vegetation, and as these have usually been held {{to be a kind}} of transition form between the flowerless and flowering plants, the geological succession has always, broadly speaking, been in accordance with the theory of evolution. Beyond this, however, the facts were very puzzling. The highest cryptogams--ferns, lycopods, and equisetaceae--appeared suddenly, and in immense profusion in the Coal formation, at which period they attained a development they have never since surpassed or even equalled; while the highest plants--the <b>dicotyledonous</b> and monocotyledonous angiosperms--which now form the bulk of the vegetation of the world, and exhibit the most wonderful modifications of form and structure, were almost unknown till the Tertiary period, when they suddenly appeared in full development, and, for the most part, under the same generic forms as now exist.|$|E

"The disk of {{the setting}} sun {{appeared}} like a globe of fire suspended over the savannah; and its last rays, as they swept the earth, illumined the extremities of the grass, strongly agitated by the evening breeze. In the low and humid places of the equinoxial zone, even when the gramineous plants and reeds present the aspect of a meadow, of turf, a rich decoration of the picture is usually wanting. I mean that variety of wild flowers which, scarcely rising above the grass, seem to lie upon a smooth bed of verdure. Between the tropics, the strength and luxury of vegetation give such a development to plants, that the smallest of the <b>dicotyledonous</b> family become shrubs.[62] It would seem as if the {214} liliaceous plants, mingled with the gramina, assumed the place of the flowers of our meadows. Their form is indeed striking; they dazzle by the variety and splendor of their colours; but, too high above the soil, they disturb that harmonious relation which exists among the plants that compose our meadows and our turf. Nature, in her beneficence, has given the landscape under every zone its peculiar type of beauty.|$|E
60|$|But seeds may be {{occasionally}} transported {{in another}} manner. Drift timber is thrown up on most islands, even on {{those in the}} midst of the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific, procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find on examination, that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly all germinated.|$|E
6000|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of fully developed exogenous flowering {{plants in the}} Cretaceous period is very analogous to the equally sudden {{appearance of}} all the chief types of placental mammalia in the Eocene; and in both cases we must feel sure that this suddenness is only apparent, due to unknown conditions which have prevented their preservation (or their discovery) in earlier formations. The case of the <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants is in some respects the most extraordinary, because in the earlier Mesozoic formations we {{appear to have a}} fair representation of the flora of the period, including such varied forms as ferns, equisetums, cycads, conifers, and monocotyledons. The only hint at an explanation of this anomaly has been given by Mr. Ball, who supposes that all these groups inhabited the lowlands, where there was not only excessive heat and moisture, but also a superabundance of carbonic acid in the atmosphere--conditions under which these groups had been developed, but which were prejudicial to the dicotyledons. These latter are supposed to have originated on the high table-lands and mountain ranges, in a rarer and drier atmosphere in which the quantity of carbonic acid gas was much less; and any deposits formed in lake beds at high altitudes and at such a remote epoch have been destroyed by denudation, and hence we have no record of their existence.[193] ...|$|E
60|$|If we {{take these}} facts as really {{representing}} the flora of the period, {{we shall be}} forced to conclude that, measured by the change effected in its plants, the lapse of time between the Lower and Upper Cretaceous deposits was far greater than between the Upper Cretaceous and the Miocene--a conclusion quite opposed to the indications afforded by the mollusca and the higher animals of the two periods. It seems probable, therefore, that these Lower Cretaceous plants represent local peculiarities of {76} vegetation such as now sometimes occur in tropical countries. On sandy or coralline islands in the Malay Archipelago there will often be found a vegetation consisting almost wholly of cycads, pandani, and palms, while a few miles off, on moderately elevated land, not a single specimen of either of these families may be seen, but a dense forest of <b>dicotyledonous</b> trees covering the whole country. A lowland vegetation, such as that above described, might be destroyed and its remains preserved by a slight depression, allowing it to be covered up by the detritus of some adjacent river, while not only would the subsidence of high land be a less frequent occurrence, but when it did occur the steep banks would be undermined by the waves, and the trees falling down would be floated away, and would either be cast on some distant shore or slowly decay on the surface or {{in the depths of}} the ocean.|$|E
6000|$|... § 5. A {{classification}} of any {{large portion of}} the field of nature in conformity to the foregoing principles, has hitherto been found practicable only in one great instance, that of animals. In the case even of vegetables, the natural arrangement has not been carried beyond the formation of natural groups. Naturalists have found, and probably will continue to find it impossible to form those groups into any series, the terms of which correspond to real gradations in the phenomenon of vegetative or organic life. Such a difference of degree may be traced between the class of Vascular Plants and that of Cellular, which includes lichens, algæ, and other substances whose organization is simpler and more rudimentary than that of the higher order of vegetables, and which therefore approach nearer to mere inorganic nature. But when we rise much above this point, we do not find any sufficient difference in the degree in which different plants possess the properties of organization and life. The dicotyledons are of more complex structure, and somewhat more perfect organization, than the monocotyledons; and some <b>dicotyledonous</b> families, such as the Compositæ, are rather more complex in their organization than the rest. But the differences are not of a marked character, and do not promise to throw any particular light upon the conditions and laws of vegetable life and development. If they did, the {{classification of}} vegetables would have to be made, like that of animals, with reference to the scale or series indicated.|$|E
60|$|The {{liability}} of plants {{to be affected}} in their fertility by slightly changed conditions is the more remarkable, as the pollen when once in process of formation is not easily injured; a plant may be transplanted, or a branch with flower-buds be cut off and placed in water, and the pollen will be matured. Pollen, also, when once mature, may be kept for weeks or even months. (18/85. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 215; 1850 page 470. Faivre gives a good resume on this subject in his 'La Variabilite des Especes' 1868 page 155.) The female organs are more sensitive, for Gartner (18/86. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 252, 338.) found that <b>dicotyledonous</b> plants, when carefully removed so {{that they did not}} in the least flag, could seldom be fertilised; this occurred even with potted plants if the roots had grown out of the hole at the bottom. In some few cases, however, as with Digitalis, transplantation did not prevent fertilisation; and according to the testimony of Mawz, Brassica rapa, when pulled up by its roots and placed in water, ripened its seed. Flower-stems of several monocotyledonous plants when cut off and placed in water likewise produce seed. But in these cases I presume that the flowers had been already fertilised, for Herbert (18/87. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 2 1847 page 83.) found with the Crocus that the plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of fertilisation, and would still perfect their seeds; but that, if transplanted before being fertilised, the application of pollen was powerless.|$|E
6000|$|We {{said just}} {{now that the}} {{classification}} of objects should follow those of their properties which indicate not only the most numerous, but also the most important peculiarities. What is here meant by importance? It has reference to the particular end in view; and the same objects, therefore, may admit with propriety of several different classifications. Each science or art forms its classification of things according to the properties which fall within its special cognizance, or of which it must take account {{in order to accomplish}} its peculiar practical end. A farmer does not divide plants, like a botanist, into <b>dicotyledonous</b> and monocotyledonous, but into useful plants and weeds.

But this would not prevent our speaking of the whale-fishery, and calling such animals fish on all occasions connected with this employment; for the relations thus arising depend upon the animal’s living in the water, and being caught {{in a manner similar to}} other fishes. A plea that human laws which mention fish do not apply to whales, would be rejected at once by an intelligent judge.”(224) ...|$|E
