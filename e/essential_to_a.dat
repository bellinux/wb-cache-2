5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E
5|$|Water is <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{thermal power}} station, heated to create steam {{to turn the}} steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two {{licensed}} boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E

25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} incandescence, which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.|$|E

25|$|He was {{a leading}} member of the Frankfurt School of {{critical}} theory, whose work {{has come to be}} associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> critique of modern society. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} both {{feedback}} from the employer and self-efficacy (belief in one's capabilities to achieve a goal) within the employee must be present for goal-setting to be effective. However, because of the tunnel vision focus created by goal-setting theory, several studies have shown this motivational theory may not be applicable in all situations. In fact, in tasks that require creative on-the-spot improvising, goal-setting can even be counterproductive. Furthermore, because clear goal specificity is <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> properly designed goal-setting task, multiple goals can create confusion for the employee and {{the end result is}} a muted overall drive. Despite its flaws, Goal-setting Theory is arguably the most dominant theory in the field of I–O psychology; over one thousand articles and reviews published in just over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E

Davis secured the backing of organized labor and made inroads among the white, urban working class, {{which would have been}} <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. Morrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent suburban Jefferson Parish, but in the industrial strip and in less Roman Catholic areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts indicated that the lion's share of the additional ballots were segregationists who backed Davis.|$|E
