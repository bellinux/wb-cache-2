Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> the thrombus itself, {{the most commonly}} used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> neutrinos. The {{vast majority of}} the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Background—Plasma tumor {{biomarkers}} {{are widely}} used clinically for monitoring response to therapy and detecting cancer recurrence. However, {{only a limited number}} of them have been effectively used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Objective—To review plasma tumor markers used clinically <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer and to provide expert opinion about future directions. Methods—Literature review, as well as our expert opinion, of plasma tumor markers that have been widely accepted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Results—In <b>the</b> United States, only prostate specific antigen (PSA), cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) have been clinically used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> prostate, ovarian, and liver cancers, respectively. Both analytical and clinical issues related to the use of these three markers were discussed. Conclusion—Few plasma tumor markers have been used effectively <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer, mainly due to their limited sensitivity and/or specificity. Multiple approaches have been developed to improve the clinical performance of tumor markers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Metrological traceability and antibody specificity are important issues to ensure comparability of immunoassays <b>for</b> <b>the</b> measurement of plasma tumor markers...|$|R

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> {{gravitational}} waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used {{to store}} photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E

This is accomplished by linking the growth of gold nanoparticles with the biocatalytic cycle of the enzyme label. The protocol adapts a conventional ELISA procedure with catalase-labeled antibodies. The enzyme consumes hydrogen peroxide, and then gold (III) ions are added to generate gold nanoparticles. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide dictates the state of aggregation of gold nanoparticles. This allows <b>for</b> <b>the</b> naked-eye <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> analytes by observing the generation of blue- or red-colored gold nanoparticle solutions.
