5000|$|Low {{frequency}} sound cannons are {{weapons of}} various types that use sound to injure or <b>incapacitate</b> <b>subjects</b> using a focused beam of sound or infrasound. Active denial systems (ADS) are a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military. The ADS directs electromagnetic radiation, specifically, high-frequency microwave radiation, at a frequency of 95 GHz, which causes {{the water in the}} upper epidermis to boil, stimulating a [...] "burning" [...] sensation in the nerve endings and generating intense pain. Dazzler lasers are directed-energy weapons that use intense light to cause temporary blindness or disorientation of rioters.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{experimentation}} involving subjects whose mental condition {{prevents them from}} understanding information and providing proper informed consent has been addressed in various codes, declarations, conventions, treaties and regulations adopted by national, international and supranational institutions and authorities. This article summarizes the basic ethical criteria these documents provide and stresses the historical development from the nearly total exclusion of <b>incapacitated</b> <b>subjects,</b> established in the mid-twentieth century, to their contemporary inclusion in clinical trials on certain ethical conditions. The problem of proxy consent by legal representatives for participation in clinical trials is addressed particularly in reference to current Italian regulations. Exceptions to human experimentation requirements in emergency situations are also briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to fully <b>incapacitate</b> the <b>subject</b> and {{minimize}} the risk of legal repercussions, the perpetrator may tend to overdose the subject. The subject may also be allergic to the drug used, may be overly sensitive to its effects and side-effects or may also be voluntarily taking a prescription drug that has dangerous interactions with the administered drug.|$|R
40|$|The TASER is a {{conducted}} electricity device {{currently being}} introduced to the Australian and New Zealand police forces {{as an alternative to}} firearms in dealing with violent and dangerous individuals. It <b>incapacitates</b> the <b>subject</b> by delivering rapid pulses of electricity causing involuntary muscle contraction and pain. The use of this device might lead to cardiovascular, respiratory, biochemical, obstetric, ocular and traumatic sequelae. This article will summarize the current literature and propose assessment and management recommendations to guide emergency physicians who will be required to review these patients...|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{medicine}} research {{requires the}} enrollment of subjects with varying decision-making capacities, including capable adults, adults incapacitated by illness or injury, and children. These different categories of subjects {{are protected by}} multiple federal regulations. These include the federal Common Rule, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations for pediatric research, and the Food and Drug Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (FDA) Final Rule for the Exception from the Requirements of Informed Consent in Emergency Situations. Investigators should {{be familiar with the}} relevant federal research regulations to optimally protect vulnerable research subjects, and to facilitate the institutional review board (IRB) review process. IRB members face particular challenges in reviewing emergency research. No regulations exist for research enrolling <b>incapacitated</b> <b>subjects</b> using proxy consent. The wording of the Final Rule may not optimally protect vulnerable subjects. It is also difficult to apply conflicting regulations to a single study that enrolls subjects with differing decision-making capacities. This article is intended as a guide for emergency researchers and IRB members who review emergency research. It reviews the elements of Federal Regulations that apply to consent, subject selection, privacy protection, and the analysis of risks and benefits in all emergency research. It explores the challenges for IRB review listed above, and offers potential solutions to these problems...|$|R

40|$|Controversy exists {{concerning}} the lethality of Tasers. These are conducted electrical weapons which <b>incapacitate</b> <b>subjects</b> by delivering an electrical charge that causes diffuse muscle contraction. In North America, over 440 deaths {{have been reported}} immediately following Taser use. Taser International has recently suggested that Tasers should not be aimed at the chest, {{although there is no}} conclusive proof that a discharge over the heart would cause an arrhythmia. The case history is presented of a young man who was shot in the chest by a Taser and presented to the emergency department in ventricular fibrillation. A 17 -year-old man was intoxicated and became violent at home. His mother called the police who, on arrival, shocked the patient in the anterior chest with a Taser (figure 1). He immediately dropped to the ground and was handcuffed. He was observed to be cyanotic and apnoeic. Paramedics arrived within 4 min and found him to be in ventricular fibrillation and defibrillated three times en route to the hospital. He was intubated, given epinephrine, atropine, sodium bicarbonate and lidocaine. His initial rhythm on arrival at the emergency department was ven-tricular fibrillation. Amiodarone 300 mg was given intravenously as well as repeated epinephrine and vasopressin. At that point, heart motion was observed with ultrasound. Levophed was started and a pulse returned. He was cooled with a Coolgard catheter (Alsius Corporation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{investigate}} sitting orthostatic tolerance and determine potentially adverse signs and symptoms that would <b>incapacitate</b> <b>subjects</b> in a hot environment (Gemini reentry cabin temperature profile) after 48 hr and 96 hr of horizontal bed rest (BR), which simulated microgravity deconditioning. Six college men (23 - 29 yr) were allocated into two groups: heat acclimated (three subjects: No. 1 - control, No. 2 - 48 hr BR, and No. 3 - 96 hr BR) and nonheat acclimated (three subjects: No. 4 - control, No. 5 - 48 hr BR, and No. 6 - 96 hr BR). After BR they sat in an ambient temperature of 57 C (135 F) for 30 min which then was decreased to 49 C (120 F) for up to 480 min. Tolerance time in the heat with seated orthostatic stress was 480 min (subject No. 1) and 180 min (subject No. 4) in the two ambulatory men, but was reduced to 22 - 150 min in the four bed-rested men irrespective of their heat acclimation status. Although heat acclimation appeared to enhance tolerance and attenuate accompanying physiological responses, as well as ameliorate the frequency and intensity of adverse signs and symptoms at termination of exposure, tolerance was reduced in the bed-rest deconditioned subjects regardless of their acclimation level. Thus, these few collective findings do not indicate an unequivocal positive effect of acute heat acclimation on sitting orthostatic tolerance in acute bed-rest deconditioned subjects...|$|R
40|$|O texto discute a política de Humanização em Saúde do ponto de vista da lógica que a sustenta, em {{particular}} como uma ação da singularidade dos atores implicados no processo de produção da Saúde. A análise desenvolvida aponta para o fato de que as práticas de atenção à saúde, quando de acordo com os cânones da lógica utilitária, refletem não apenas uma ordem autoritária, como produzem sujeitos cerceados, fragmentados e incapazes. A humanização em Saúde é considerada uma possibilidade política de se alterar essa lógica e de instaurar, no interior das instituições, espaços de liberdade capazes de acolher, amparar, sustentar e dar significado à presença e às ações de profissionais de saúde, gestores e pacientes, ao considerar suas dimensões subjetivas e singulares. The text {{presents the}} politics of Humanization in Health {{from the point of}} view of the logic that gives support to it, i. e., as an action of the actors' singularity implicated in the process of Health production. The analysis points to the fact that the practices devoted to health attention, when in consonance with the prescriptions of the utilitarian logic reflect an authoritarian order, but also produce reduced, fragmented and <b>incapacitated</b> <b>subjects.</b> The humanization in the field of Health is considered as a political possibility of altering that logic and of establishing within the institutions spaces of freedom capable to hold, to aid, to sustain and to give a different meaning to the presence and professionals providing health actions, as well as managers and patients, considering their subjective and singular dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} medical {{research}} with persons who lack decision-making capacity is rapidly increasing, {{but in most}} states it takes place without clear legal authority. In addition to creating significant liability risks for researchers and persons who provide consent on behalf of <b>incapacitated</b> <b>subjects,</b> the lack of explicit legal standards means that few, if any, safeguards exist to protect incapacitated persons 2 ̆ 7 rights and welfare. Previous efforts {{to close the gap}} between clinical reality and legal requirements have failed in part because they have not provided a coherent or persuasive ethical justification for permitting this research. This Article seeks to fill that void by proposing a new way of thinking about the ethics of research with incapacitated persons, grounded in a long-term, systemic approach to risk-benefit assessment. This approach explains why it is ultimately in incapacitated persons 2 ̆ 7 best interests to be governed by a policy that permits them to be enrolled in research without their personal authorization [...] even if such a policy puts them at risk of participating in studies that, when viewed in isolation, may involve more burdens than benefits. Unlike other approaches, the framework developed here does not depend on false analogies between participating in research and receiving medical treatment, or dubious claims about family members 2 ̆ 7 inherent authority or incapacitated persons 2 ̆ 7 obligations to society. Because the proposed framework directly responds to the criticism that research with incapacitated persons is a form of exploitation, it may increase the likelihood that proposals to authorize this research will actually be adopted. It also has important implications for both how laws governing research with incapacitated persons should be structured, and the roles and responsibilities of surrogate decision makers...|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile; chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is {{the defining}} {{component of a}} tear gas {{commonly referred to as}} CS gas, which is used as a riot control agent. Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes {{to the extent that the}} subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the nose, mouth and throat mucous membranes causing profuse coughing, mucous nasal discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially <b>incapacitating</b> the <b>subject.</b> CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.|$|R
40|$|Although {{telerobotics}} and {{extravehicular activity}} (EVA) are often portrayed as competitive approaches to space operations, ongoing {{research in the}} Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) has demonstrated the utility of cooperative roles in an integrated EVA/telerobotic work site. Working in the neutral buoyancy simulation environment, tests were performed on interactive roles or EVA subjects and telerobots in structural assembly and satellite servicing tasks. In the most elaborate of these tests to date, EVA subjects were assisted by the SSL's Beam Assembly Teleoperator (BAT) in several servicing tasks planned for Hubble Space Telescope, using the high-fidelity crew training article in the NASA Marshall Neutral Buoyancy Simulator. These tests revealed several shortcomings {{in the design of}} BAT for satellite servicing and demonstrated the utility of a free-flying or RMS-mounted telerobot for providing EVA crew assistance. This paper documents the past tests, including the use of free-flying telerobots to effect the rescue of a simulated <b>incapacitated</b> EVA <b>subject,</b> and details planned future efforts in this area, including the testing of a new telerobotic system optimized for the satellite servicing role, the development of dedicated telerobotic devices designed specifically for assisting EVA crew, and conceptual approaches to advanced EVA/telerobotic operations such as the Astronaut Operations Vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Rich in potential- {{in human}} and natural resources- Uttar Pradesh (UP) once {{appeared}} positioned {{to be the}} pace-setter for India's economic and social development. However, {{the growth rate of}} Uttar Pradesh has declined in the Eleventh Five Year Plan as against Bihar. The paper finds the causes of poverty and unemployment in Uttar Pradesh; it also analyse important socio-economic indicators of Uttar Pradesh. This research paper is based entirely on secondary data. The paper finds that demographic transition seems to be correlated with growth, with some reasons to believe that causality flows both ways—lower dependency ratios increase growth and higher growth reduces fertility and consequently dependency ratios. Rising rural incomes consequent to higher productivity will create a multiplier effect increasing farm and non farm products and services, thereby stimulating rapid growth of employment opportunity in other sectors. Cunha, (2010) findings demonstrates the close interaction between a person’s job and their place in society. Poverty <b>incapacitates</b> its <b>subjects</b> in utilizing available public facilities. This, in turn, prevents poor people from advancing in economic and social spheres of life. Alleviation calls for targeted interventions and in the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the emphasis has been laid on inclusive growth meaning thereby that growth benefits will reach all especially to the lowest strata of the society...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} Michel Foucault’s {{notion of}} “archive” {{which for the}} philosopher should be understood in the broader sense, {{not only as a}} place of gathering and of preserving documents but also as a discursive machine which forms and constructs a subject identity. The prefix “arche” suggests that every archive is implicated in mechanisms of power which high-handedly demarcates the archive, defines its status and decides what should be excluded outside. The archive establishes a field of the utterance possibility and decides, in other words, what one can speak of and what one must pass over in silence. Is it then possible to stand up to this archival diktat, i. e. is it then possible to express that which has not been included in the archive or that which has been excluded and condemned to dumbness? If history was written only by the winners, it means that the voice of the oppressed could appear only in the writing of oppressors who thereby become paradoxical representatives of their victims. Referring to Jacques Derrida’s and Pascal Quignard’s works, I try to prove that archival diktat, however authoritarian it can be, doesn’t <b>incapacitate</b> the <b>subject</b> entirely. In their opinion (and from the point of Foucault’s view) the place where one can expresses that which can’t be expressed (and which is absent in the archive) is literature which becomes thereby an an-archival or even an-archic place par excellence. Literature becomes a place of an ethical gesture toward a bruised past, it takes the side of those who have been deprived of voice. One should, according to Walter Benjamin’s famous statement, “account for the truth, that nothing which has ever happened is to be given as lost to history”. Against dominative power we should oppose with the apologia of the harassed, inappreciable and defeated existence...|$|R

On August 23, 2012, King's autopsy results were released, stating he died of accidental drowning, and that a combination of alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and PCP found in his system were contributing factors. The conclusion of the report stated: [...] "The effects of the drugs and alcohol, combined with the subject's heart condition, probably precipitated a cardiac arrhythmia, and the <b>subject,</b> <b>incapacitated</b> in the water, was unable to save himself." [...] King had been a user of PCP. Rev. Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy at King's funeral. King is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills), Los Angeles, California.|$|R
