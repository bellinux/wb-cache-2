50|$|In 2000, the 151 km Teesside to Saltend {{pipeline}} {{was opened}} which transports ethylene to Saltend {{to be used}} on site. In March 2007, BP Announced the sale of their Vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and Ethyl acetate (ETAC) plants to Ineos Oxides which also included ownership and maintenance of the <b>ethylene</b> <b>pipeline</b> from Teesside. In 2009, BP created the Saltend Chemicals Parksic, which covers an area of 370 acre and they continued to manage the site until March 2017 when Teesside based PX Group took over the day to day running of the park.|$|E
50|$|Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate {{natural gas}} {{pipeline}} companies were consolidated {{into a new}} entity - Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP - which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merges into Gulf South in 2015. In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana. In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline <b>ethylene</b> <b>pipeline</b> system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers. Boardwalk Field Services, LLC develops and operates gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, and processing infrastructure, and in June 2013 placed its processing plant into service.|$|E

50|$|The {{lake and}} Calcasieu estuary has been embroiled in {{controversy}} since the 1994 Condea Vista <b>ethylene</b> dichloride <b>pipeline</b> spill. The spill, {{according to the}} web site Axiom Amnesia was estimated between 19 and 47 million pounds and is considered “one of the largest in U.S. History". The affected part of the estuary includes (but is not limited to) the Calcasieu River from northern Moss Lake up to the salt water barrier, that is north of both the existing bridge and any realigned new bridge in Lake Charles. The affected area includes Bayou d’Inde, Bayou Verdine, dredged spoil islands, and Clooney and Coon Island Loop.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{process design}} and economic analysis into the possible threat of ethylene- based acrylic acid manufacture is presented. <b>Pipeline</b> <b>ethylene</b> is fed at 14, 000 ft 2 /hr {{to the first}} block of this process. The epoxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide takes advantage of microchannel technology and {{eliminates the need for}} inerts, thus decreasing equipment sizing downstream while achieving a yield of 80 % overall. The resulting ethylene oxide stream is carbonylated in a liquid phase, homogeneous reaction. The β-propiolactone is then rearranged in phosphoric acid to produce 37, 000 lbs of acrylic acid per hour for a yearly rate of just over 300 M pounds at greater than 99. 4 % mass purity. The product contains 300 ppm mono-methyl ether hydroquinone to prevent the product from polymerizing and entering the explosive limits. Using an after tax discount rate of 15 %, the NPV is -$ 50 M in December, 2014, 35 years from construction start date. The IRR is 13. 84 % and confirms the notion that a microchannel costs need to be further evaluated to determine the profitability. In the project, the EO plant accounts for 90 % of the equipment cost and 50 % of the total invested capital cost. A cost plus analysis of ethylene oxide costs was determined and IRR data was determined based on the variability of ethylene prices and the cost-plus price of producing ethylene oxide. It was determined that the project has an IRR of 42. 17 % with a NPV of $ 288 M when an after tax cash flow analysis was conducted with an after tax discount rate of 15 %. It was concluded that the feasibility of this project depends heavily on the cost of the microchannel reactors, and at this stage, the costs of the microchannel do not outweigh the advantages offered by the new reactor. It is recommended that further analysis be done to more accurately cost the microchannel reactor and to investigate the benefits of increasing the per pass conversion of ethylene. Further analysis on the reactor designs and rates for the carbonylation step and rearrangement step could help hone in the reality of an ethylene based acrylic acid process. Most importantly, further economics should be conducted to see if the best-case scenario assumptions used in this paper are too ideal. The new economics should be compared to the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study...|$|R
2500|$|Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first {{manufacturing}} site in Canada, {{located in the}} Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as [...] "The Blob", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected {{nearly half of the}} site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. [...] The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with <b>ethylene</b> through a <b>pipeline</b> from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit on April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.|$|R
40|$|Pipelines {{and other}} linear {{structures}} often cover large distances across topographically and geologically varied ground. In the last decade, or so, geological information {{has started to}} become available in digital form for countries and regions. This enables a wide-range of users, including pipeline operators, to access interpreted geohazard information {{not only for the}} construction of new linear infrastructure, but also to assess a range of geological risks to existing linear infrastructure that might have been constructed before such information was available. Examples of the use of such information are discussed in relation to Great Britain’s national natural gas and <b>ethylene</b> <b>pipeline</b> networks and the possible raising of the Thames Estuary flood embankment that helps to protect London from flooding. Future developments in the provision of geological information are discussed, including bespoke information systems in which the outputs are defined by the users rather than the information holders...|$|E
40|$|Ethanol is {{produced}} through two methods of fermenting and hydration of ethylene. In this article, regarding {{low rates of}} ethanol production in Iran (1. 5 ´ 10 8 liters per year) and extreme requirement of global industry to ethanol as a fuel additive, the capacity of ethanol production in Iran has been discussed. Adding ethanol to fuels would make them environmental friendly and as a result, huge amounts of ethanol would be required. It is declared that Iran, having the biggest <b>ethylene</b> <b>pipeline</b> in the world, {{has the potential of}} massive ethanol production and could play a pivotal role for global ethanol manufacturing in the near future. In addition, producing ethanol and exporting it is investigated via the simulation of an ethanol factory. Direct hydration of ethylene is the recommended method in this study. Simulation of this process was done using HYSYS software and the optimization results are illustrated based on Aspen Plus software...|$|E
