5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines that were to alert the acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> migration processes in walls made from autoclaved aerated concrete blocks. The paper gives theoretical calculation of <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> migration processes in autoclaved aerated concrete walls as well as based on practical measurements. Analyzing experimental data, the model for <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> migration processes in walls made from autoclaved aerated concrete blocks was created and tested. The influence of drying process in autoclaved aerated concrete wall on the heat transfer process of the wall was also studied in this paper. The offered model of calculations takes into account the property of autoclaved aerated concrete as a porous material to enable the most accurate description of <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> migration processes in the external walls of enclosures in various exploitation conditions. Humidity migration in autoclaved aerated concrete takes place from closed micro pores to smaller semi opened ones, and then to bigger connected pores. In contrast to already known calculation models of the heat engineering qualities of external walls this model takes into account material internal structural changes, which consider the irregular structure of autoclaved aerated concrete, allowing for each separate diffusion process in layers...|$|R

5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened {{by the time they}} reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E

Using both conditional logit and panel mixed logit models, we find reasonably precise estimates of the willingness to pay for four improved <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> control devices, which would cover the capital costs of two of the devices, and about three-quarters {{of the cost of the}} other two devices...|$|R
5|$|Grant {{was nearly}} broke and worried {{constantly}} about leaving {{his wife a}} suitable {{amount of money to}} live on. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking.

5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{sequence of}} June 3–11, 2008 {{was a series}} of tornado outbreaks affecting most of central and eastern North America from June 311, 2008. 192tornadoes were confirmed, along with widespread straightline wind wind damage. Seven people were killed from a direct result of tornadoes; four in Iowa, two in Kansas, and one in Indiana. Eleven additional people were killed across five states by other weather events including lightning, flash flooding, and straight-line winds. Severe flooding was also reported in much of Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa {{as a result of the}} same thunderstorms, while high <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> affected much of eastern North America; particularly along the eastern seaboard of the United States from New York City to the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} {{to the race}} highlighted {{the dominance of the}} Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside the two historically strong nations. A few kilometres later, she dropped back from the pack and at the 10km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen-second advantage {{on the rest of the}} field. As the race reached the midway point, the temperature began to increase and the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> reduced the pace of the runners. The conditions took their toll on some of the leaders in this section of the race. Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu, Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners. Kiplagat, Dire, Arusei and Feyse Tadese were the sole contenders remaining as the race headed towards the final stages, but Kiplagat and Dire soon left the other two trailing a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>humidity</b> that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to design a Sensing socksfor Diabetic {{patients}} and alert the patients in case of anyphysical parameter extremity and to detect tissue damagebecause of <b>heat,</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>humidity.</b> This will alert thepatient if anyone the parameter exceeds the permissible time /quantity limit. Data acquisition system using LabVIEW isdesigned to create a database for storing the information from the sensor. Diabetic neuropathy is a lack of feeling accompanied by tingling, burning, pain, or numbness in the legs and feet due to nerve damage. Loss of sensation in the lower limb and feet contributes to the risk of developing foot ulcers. When the nerve disease causes a complete loss of sensation in the feet, patients may not be aware of injuries to the feet, and fail to properly protect them. To avoid foot ulcers, sores and to alert the patients from skin injuries We have designed a socks which can be worn by the patient and it helps in monitoring the patient continuously and provides alert to the patient if there is any risks in increase <b>heat,</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>humidity,</b> so that tissue damage can be avoided...|$|R
