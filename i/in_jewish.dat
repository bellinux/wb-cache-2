5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{announced}} he would be stepping down as rabbi in 2011, and the synagogue hired Boris Dolin as his successor.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E

5|$|The {{declaration}} spurred {{an unintended}} and extraordinary {{increase in the}} number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of the Zionist position <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{examined}} {{correlates of}} belief <b>in</b> a <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory among Malays in Malaysia, {{a culture in}} which state-directed conspiracism as a means of dealing with perceived external and internal threats is widespread. In Study 1, 368 participants from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, completed a novel measure of belief <b>in</b> a <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation and anomie. Initial analysis showed that the novel scale factorially reduced to a single dimension. Further analysis showed that belief <b>in</b> the <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory was only significantly associated with general conspiracist ideation, but the strength of the association was weak. In Study 2, 314 participants completed the measure of belief <b>in</b> the <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation and ideological attitudes. Results showed that belief <b>in</b> the <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory was associated with anti-Israeli attitudes, modern racism directed at Chinese, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation. General conspiracist ideation did not emerge as a significant predictor once other variables had been accounted for. These results suggest that there may be specific cultural and social psychological forces that drive belief <b>in</b> the <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory within the Malaysian context. Specifically, belief <b>in</b> the <b>Jewish</b> conspiracy theory among Malaysian Malays appears to serve ideological needs and as a mask for anti-Chinese sentiment, which may in turn reaffirm their perceived ability to shape socio-political processes...|$|R

5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5|$|Caligula did {{not trust}} the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had {{connections}} with Egyptian separatists. In AD 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus. According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as {{the king of the}} Jews. Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> synagogues. As a result, riots broke out in the city. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.|$|E
5|$|Many myths {{surrounding}} vampires originated {{during the}} medieval period. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse draugr is another medieval {{example of an}} undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event {{to the lack of}} a shmirah (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.|$|E

5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|While {{imprisoned in}} 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{dictated}} Mein Kampf to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology {{in which he}} laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> Bolshevism, a conspiracy theory that posited {{the existence of an}} international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf. The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische).|$|E
