40|$|Road surface {{condition}} measurements are in Austria periodically obtained {{for all the}} federal roads. These measurements refer to 50 m long road sections and {{form the basis for}} an evaluation of {{the current state of the}} road network as well as the subsequent analysis of maintenance strategies and their funding requirements. In order to systematically utilize the information contained in these measurement series, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>sections</b> have to be identified for longitudinal and transversal unevenness as well as skid resistance. For that purpose a recently published segmentation algorithm has been implemented as a stand-alone computer program that is capable of processing huge amounts of data in batch mode. This software takes a measurement series as input and identifies the borders of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>sections</b> by evaluating the statistical properties of the measurement series under study. A variety of quantities representing the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>sections</b> is calculated and can be exported in widely understood file formats for further processing. While the program is able to execute fully automatically, the user has the option to control all aspects of the implemented algorithm and might alter any suggested segmentation using the graphical interface of the application. About 10, 000 km of Austrian federal roads of category B have been successfully processed using this computer program, and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>sections</b> based respectively on measurements of the International Roughness Index, rut depth, and skid resistance have been identified and stored in the Austrian Pavement Management System.

An in-depth analysis of the processes and management systems Rimailho set up, described in minute detail in his major works, has led to the belief that he was the pioneer of a certain type of the activity-based costing method. But other aspects of his work are far more interesting. With Rimailho, accountancy plays a role which is closely linked to his political and social convictions. Rimailho's management accounting appears as the strategic tool in a type of corporate regulation involving organizational slack, possible in a defender 's strategy deployed in a specific competitive and technological environment. Rimailho's organization does not fit into today's standard typologies (Anthony, Woodward, Ouchi, etc.).

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, a lot of road-accident-predictive models have been {{developed}} by using Multiple Linear Regression and Poisson or Negative Binomial Distribution. More innovative methodologies based on fuzzy logic and neural networks have also been used. The application of these methodologies is not easy when {{a large number of}} variables is considered. Moreover, the influence of some variables on road accidents might not be equally significant. It would thus appears useful to have an analysis tool primarily in order to remove the redundant variables for accident-predictive models. Even if under-used in crash data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be suitable for this purpose. PCA is a form of analysis used for extracting a reduced number of factors, called principal components, from a set of original variables, discarding as little of the information as possible. Our objective is to verify PCA potentiality for removing redundant variables in accident analysis. For this purpose a five-year monitoring period was carried out on a four-lane median divided road. A database was subsequently created with the surveys regarding the type and number of accidents, traffic flow, horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distances and pavement surface characteristics.
