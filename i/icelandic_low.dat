2500|$|As noted, {{the process}} of ice {{formation}} and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation {{and the formation of}} water masses. [...] With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. [...] For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre. During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Low,</b> which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. [...] These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. [...] There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is {{a weather}} {{phenomenon}} in the North Atlantic Ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level (SLP) between the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>low</b> and the Azores high.

40|$|The midlatitude zonal {{westerlies}} {{continued to}} be stronger than normal during June, {{as they have for}} most of the year so far. As during the previous month (Dickson 1972), the 700 -mb flow was not strong over the United States, but was anomalously strong over the oceans, where deep Aleutian and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Lows</b> were observed with stronger than normal midocean ridges (figs. 1, 2). The gradient over the north Atlantic was especially remarkable, as 700 -mb heights mere 118 m above normal east of Newfoundland but 115 m below normal between Scotland and Iceland. The peak 700 -mb mean wind speed was 19 m/s, which is 12 m/s above normal at that location just southeast of the tip of Greenland (fig. 4). The mean polar Low persisted with greater than normal vigor near Baffin Island. The height anomaly change from May to June (fig. 3) showed a relative strengthening of the westerly gradient over northern portions of the two oceans. This was accomplished by the building of the subtropical ridges into midlatitudes while the normal early summer weakening of the Aleutian and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Lows</b> failed to occur (cf. fig. 1 with fig. 1 of Dickson 1972).

40|$|An {{analysis}} of satellite sea-ice records for recent decades reveals a highly coherent {{spatial and temporal}} structure of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) wintertime sea-ice variability and its close link to anomalous atmospheric circulation. The dominant mode of the wintertime sea-ice variability {{is characterized by a}} double-dipole composed of one dipole over the North Atlantic and the other over the North Pacific, which are mutually correlated interannually. This dominant sea-ice mode is lag correlated with the winter-averaged North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index at lags up to two winters when the NAO leads. In the sub-Arctic, significant lead–lag relationships exist between sea-ice extent (SIE) anomalies on regional scales, which are closely associated with atmospheric circulation anomalies. An eastward evolving pattern is identified in regional SIE anomalies from the Labrador to Nordic and farther to the Okhotsk Sea at multi-year time-scales, led by anomalously weak Aleutian and strong <b>Icelandic</b> <b>lows.</b> The results suggest the presence of climate memories over the North Atlantic and Eurasia, which are crucial for recent downward trends in the NH SIE by transforming atmospheric influences into slower changes in sea-ice conditions. The summer Okhotsk high, which leads to a sea-ice reduction along the east Siberian coast and further affects sea-ice conditions over the Arctic Ocean, is a key link betwee...|$|R
40|$|The high {{accumulation}} rate, {{nearly complete}} preservation and detailed chronology of the Eclipse ice core, Yukon Territory, Canada, are {{well suited for}} comparison of the glaciochemical record with instrumental time series of temperature, precipitation and sea-level pressure. Results of cross-correlation analysis of instrumental temperature records with the Eclipse 18 O time series reveal a significant positive relationship between summertime 18 O at Eclipse and summer (April-September) temperatures in northwestern North America. The {{results indicate that the}} Eclipse 18 O time series provides a better proxy for regional temperature than does the 18 O time series from the Mount Logan ice-core record for which only negative correlations were found. Winter accumulation at Eclipse is significantly correlated with several sites in Alaska, but not with any sites in the Yukon. The 18 O, accumulation and glaciochemical time series also display significant correlations with the Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure dataset, especially between wintertime sulfate and nitrate concentrations at Eclipse and the intensity of the wintertime Siberian high and Aleutian and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>lows.</b> These results suggest that year-to-year variability in the deposition of pollutants at Eclipse can be linked to changes in atmospheric circulation, while longterm trends can be explained by changes in source strength...|$|R

40|$|Seesaw {{relationship}} in intensity between the surface Aleutian and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Lows</b> (AIS) is {{a manifestation of}} atmospheric teleconnection that bridges the interannual variability over the Pacific and Atlantic in particular winter months. Analysis of the 20 th Century Reanalysis data reveals that the strength and timing of AIS have undergone multi-decadal modulations in conjunction with those in structure of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) signature, extracted in the leading mode of interannual sea-level pressure (SLP) variability over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. Specifically, events {{of what may be}} called ‘pure AO’, in which SLP anomalies exhibit a high degree of axial symmetry in association with in-phase SLP variability between the midlatitude Atlantic and Pacific, tended to occur during multi-decadal periods in which the inter-basin teleconnection through AIS was active under the enhanced interannual variability of the Aleutian Low. In contrast, the axial symmetry of the AO pattern was apparently reduced during a multi-decadal period in which the AIS teleconnection was inactive under the weakened interannual variability of the Aleutian Low. In this period, the leading mode of interannual SLP variability represented a meridional seesaw between the Atlantic and Arctic, which resembles SLP anomaly pattern associated with the cold-ocean/warm-land (COWL) temperature pattern. These multi-decadal modulations in interannual AIS signal and the axial symmetry of the interannual AO pattern occurred under multi-decadal changes in the background state that also represented the polarity changes of the COWL-like anomaly pattern...|$|R

50|$|Although at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as Vancouver or Paris, Baie-Comeau has a borderline humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), just above the subarctic climate.

50|$|However, {{during the}} winter of 2010-11 in Northern and Western Europe, the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>low,</b> {{typically}} positioned west of Iceland and east of Greenland, appeared regularly to the east of Iceland and so allowed exceptionally cold air into Europe from the Arctic. A strong area of high pressure was initially situated over Greenland, reversing the normal wind pattern in the northwestern Atlantic, creating a blocking pattern driving warm air into northeastern Canada and cold air into Western Europe, as was the case during the previous winter. This occurred during a La Niña season, and is connected to the rare Arctic dipole anomaly.|$|E

40|$|The {{greenhouse}} scenario {{assumes that}} sea level will rise worldwide at uniform rates because of near-polar ice melting {{or because of}} thermal expansion of ocean waters. This view ignores the natural variability of existing sea-level behaviour that occurs globally over time. It also {{ignores the fact that}} some of this variability is related to changes in climatic parameters such as precipitation, barometric pressure and temperature that will be influenced by the greenhouse effect. This paper presents existing evidence on sea-level variability across the globe and links it to changes in atmospheric pressure, air temperature and precipitation for the period 1933 - 1980. Rapid fluctuations in rates of sea-level change occur over distances as little as 200 km. Additionally, sea-level directly responds to changes in climatic variables near areas of greatest seasonal climatic change, namely the coastlines affected by the Asian monsoon and beneath the path of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere. Aseasonal effects are greatest along coastlines bordering the Aleutian and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>lows.</b> The current postulated worldwide rise in sea-level of 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm y may be occurring concomitantly with increasing climatic trends in temperature, precipitation, surface pressure and intensity of pressure cells. These results will have a significant impact within the greenhouse scenario. An accelerated worldwide rise in sea-level will be difficult to detect because of the inherent variability that exists over time and space. Seasonal and inter-annual variability in tropical regions can exceed 40 cm and already poses a natural hazard that will only be exacerbated by the effects of a global rise due to greenhouse warming in these locations. In some temperate locations, rates of sea-level rise already exceed rates proposed within the scenario, while in parts of Scandinavia and northwestern North America negative rates will locally reduce the impact. Because of the linkages in behaviour between sea-level and climatic variables, negative and positive feedback will be superimposed at regional levels upon any global sea-level rise induced by the green¬house effect. This will add a degree of uncertainty to sea-level predictions at many locations...|$|R
