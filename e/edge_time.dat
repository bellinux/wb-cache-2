The mechanism of slower spin relaxation near the edge is related to electrons reflections from the boundary {{and the lack of}} the translation symmetry.

40|$|Wound bed {{preparation}} {{is now a}} well established concept and the TIME framework has been developed as a practical tool to assist practitioners when assessing and managing patients with wounds. It is important, however, to remember to assess the whole patient; the wound bed preparation ‘care cycle ’ promotes {{the treatment of the}} ‘whole ’ patient and not just the ‘hole ’ in the patient.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} the sustained negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (sNBR) using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} during a finger tapping task. We observed that the sNBR for this task was more extensive than has previously been reported. The cortical regions involved in sNBR are divided into the following three groups: frontal, somatosensory and occipital. By investigating the spatial structure, area, amplitude, and dynamics of the sNBR in comparison with those of its positive BOLD response (PBR) counterpart, we made the following observations. First, among the three groups, the somatosensory group contained the greatest number of activated voxels and the fewest deactivated voxels. In addition, the amplitude of the sNBR in this group was the smallest among the three groups. Second, the onset and peak time of the sNBR are both larger than those of the PBR, whereas the falling <b>edge</b> <b>time</b> of the sNBR is less than that of the PBR. Third, the long distance between most sNBR foci and their corresponding PBR foci makes it unlikely that they share the same blood supply artery. Fourth, the couplings between the sNBR and its PBR counterpart are distinct among different regions and thus should be investigated separately. These findings imply that the origin of most sNBR foc...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of aeroacoustic noise predictions based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements is studied. For this purpose, experiments are conducted on a sharp trailing edge (TE) flow developed along a flat plate at {{free stream velocity}} of 15 m/s. The acoustic emissions were characterized in the NLR Small Anechoic Wind Tunnel (KAT) by means of microphone measurements. The result is used for benchmarking the PIV based noise predictions. PIV measurements were carried in a low-speed wind tunnel of TU Delft with similar properties {{to that of the}} KAT facility. Planar PIV measurements, performed at high spatial resolution, characterize the turbulent properties of the boundary layer travelling across the trailing <b>edge.</b> <b>Time</b> resolved Tomographic PIV measurements are obtained over a volume of 19. 7 mm x 9. 1 mm x 33. 4 mm at an acquisition rate of 12 kHz. Two different approaches are compared for the prediction of TE noise based on PIV data. The first follows diffraction theory and requires the deduction of the instantaneous surface pressure fluctuations from PIV data. The second one relies on the integral solution of the Lighthill equation obtained through a tailored Green’s function for a semi-infinite half plane. This allows to calculate the scattered noise directly from the velocity data. The predictions based on diffraction theory agree well with the measured far field spectrum up to 4 kHz. In contrast, the Green’s function approach yields a significant and systematic overprediction of approximately 12 dB. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Noise {{induced by}} {{impedance}} discontinuities from VLSI pack-aging {{is one of}} the leading challenges facing system level designers in the next decade. The performance of IC cores far exceeds that of current packaging technology. The risetimes of IC signals require that the interconnect of the package be treated as transmission lines. As a result, impedance discon-tinuities in the package cause reflections which may result in intermittent switching of digital signals and <b>edge</b> <b>time</b> degradation, both of which limit system performance. The major cause of the impedance discontinuity in the package is the high inductance of the wire bond interconnect. To compensate for this problem, capacitance can be placed near the wire bond to reduce its effective impedance over a given frequency range. This paper presents the application of this impedance matching technique for use in broadband digital signals that are prevalent in modern VLSI designs. Both static and dynamic compensation approaches are presented. The static compensator places pre-defined capacitances on the package and on the IC to surround the wire bond inductance. The dynamic compensator places a switchable capacitance on the IC that can be programmed to a desired value, thereby enabling the designer to overcome design and manufacturing variations in the wire bond. Both techniques presented are shown to bound the reflections of the wire bond to less than 5 % (down from 20 % for an uncompensated structure) for wire bonds up to 5 mm in length, and for frequencies up to 3 GHz. In addition, both circuits utilizes less area than a typical wire bond pad, making them ideal for placement directly beneath the wire bond pads. I...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Therapeutic carotid {{occlusion}} is {{an established}} technique {{for treatment of}} large and giant aneurysms of the (CA, in patients with synchronous venous filling on angiography during BTO. Concern remains that hemodynamic alterations after permanent occlusion will predispose the patient to new ischemic injury in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess whether BTO with synchronous venous filling is associated with normal CBF long term after carotid sacrifice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients were included (all women; mean age, 50. 5 years; mean follow-up, 38. 5 months). ASL with single and multiple TIs was used to assess CBF and its temporal characteristics. Selective ASL was used to assess actual territorial contribution of the (CA and BA. Collateral flow via the AcomA or PcomA or both was determined by time-resolved 3 D PCMR. Paired t tests were used to compare CBF and timing parameters between hemispheres. RESULTS: Absolute CBF values were within the normal range. There was no significant CBF difference between hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to carotid sacrifice (49. 4 +/- 11. 2 versus 50. 1 +/- 10. 1 mL/ 100 g/min). Arterial arrival time and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>time</b> were significantly prolonged on the occlusion side (816 +/- 119 ms versus 741 +/- 103 ms, P =. 001; and 1765 +/- 179 ms versus 1646 190 ms, P <. 001). Two patients had collateral flow through the AcomA only and were found to have increased timing parameters compared with 9 patients with mixed collateral flow through both the AcomA and PcomA.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of population dynamics including the identification of reproductive areas and their contribution {{to the maintenance of}} fish stocks is essential for population conservation. Dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, is a broadly distributed fish species, usually found in marine rocky bottoms. It is currently listed as “endangered” by the IUCN Red List. The available information on its population in southern Brazil suggests that the neritic habitat of Carpinteiro Bank - CB is the main growth and spawning ground in the region. We investigated if the dusky groupers caught in the rocky-jetties of Rio Grande city (a littoral artificial habitat with no spawning activity) originated from the CB. We sampled 28 individuals from the littoral rocky-jetties aged between 2 and 12 years, and 44 individuals from the neritic CB aged between 2 and 40 years. Individuals from both areas had their otolith sections analyzed with LA-ICPMS (core-to-edge profiles) for 86 Sr: 43 Ca, 138 Ba: 43 Ca ratios. The otolith core (natal origin) and <b>edge</b> (<b>time</b> shortly before capture) from individuals of the same age class showed no difference between the two sites. Individual profiles of 138 Ba: 43 Ca ratios of fish from the littoral zone indicated, for the first time, that some juveniles of dusky grouper enter the Patos lagoon and remain within the estuarine environment {{between the first and second}} years of life. This interpretation of otolith chemical data is supported by the marked differences in salinity between the littoral and estuarine sites in these studies areas, and by the marked differences in otolith 138 Ba: 43 Ca of other fish species analyzed along the salinity gradient in the Patos Lagoon estuary.

40|$|The SILVER Spark for Nevada: Sustainable Innovation Leading a Vital Economic Renaissance Nevada. A State of stark contrasts, with {{historic}} booms {{and devastating}} busts experienced throughout its modern history. A State frequently forced to reinvent itself as ever-evolving circumstances have demanded. A State {{that has been}} driven to the <b>edge</b> <b>time</b> after time and, yet again and again, has managed to discover another way to prosper. A State that now finds itself in a precarious position as the “Great Recession” hit it harder than any other and has left it struggling to recover. As you will conclude by reading The SILVER Spark, Nevada can successfully build a globally-competitive economic engine based on innovation and entrepreneurship through the commercialization of research, discovery, and development. It will, however, require changes in how the State operates, by uniting the many competing visions, missions and goals found statewide. Although the seventh largest state geographically, Nevada is only the thirty-fifth most populous state in the Union. So it must also find a unique way to focus its admittedly stretched resources on a strategic set of priorities to successfully diversify its economy. The ‘SILVER’ Spark proposes an approach {{to do exactly what}} so many across the State have suggested must be done for so long—transform the State’s legacy economy and create new-economy jobs. It advocates the application of sustainable innovation to lead a vital economic renaissance through the following three major transformational actions: Drive more public and private innovation in the State. Improve the State-wide commercialization ecosystem. Accelerate entrepreneurial activity throughout Nevada. Nevada is uniquely Nevadan.

40|$|Finally, the PSRR {{performance}} of LDO is studied. An energy-efficient embedded ripple feed-forward path is {{proposed to improve}} the PSRR of LDO. Comparing with some state-of-the-art techniques for PSRR improvement, the proposed LDO features very simple structure thus low-power consumption. A LDO implemented in 0. 18 -mum CMOS technology with 0. 042 -mm 2 active area {{has been designed to}} verify the idea. With an external 4. 7 -muF output capacitor, in the maximum load condition (i. e. at 25 mA), the PSRR is - 77 dB at 1 MHz, - 85 dB at 2. 5 MHz and - 55 dB at 5 MHz, respectively. The quiescent current is 15 muA only, while the transient voltage overshoot or undershoot is less than 40 mV when load current changes between 1 mA and 25 mA with 40 -ns step time. The LDO achieves good line and load regulations of 3 mV/V and 50 muV/mA, respectively. Remotely- or battery-powered wireless system-on-a-chip (SoC) needs energy-efficient and high-integration power-management solutions due to their energy-aware characteristics. Low-dropout regulator (LDO) is a good solution because of its excellent performances such as low power consumption, fast load-transient response and high power-supply ripple rejection (PSRR). Moreover, it is easy to be fully integrated since no inductor is needed to be the energy-storage element. Recent development of output-capacitorless LDO (OCL-LDO) realizes on-chip, local voltage regulation to enable more effective integrated power management for SoC. In this thesis, OCL-LDOs with low power consumption and fast load-transient response are investigated and presented in this thesis. LDO with output capacitor for high-PSRR operation to provide clean power supply to RF circuits is also reported. Three LDOs are developed and fabricated to verify the proposed ideas. The first design is an ultra low-power voltage regulator for remotely powered energy-autonomous devices. It has been fabricated in a commercial 0. 18 -mum CMOS technology and applied to a passive UHF RFID tag IC. With the low-power voltage reference circuit and sub-threshold operations, the total quiescent current is 700 nA under a 1. 8 -V power supply. The output voltage of the regulator is 1. 45 V with load capability of 50 muA. The temperature coefficients of the voltage reference and the output voltage are only 9 and 43 ppm/°C, respectively. A POR signal with 150 -ns-width pulse is also generated to reset the digital processing part in the tag IC. The second design is a fast-transient OCL-LDO, which has been implemented in a commercial 90 -nm CMOS technology. Experimental result verifies that it is stable for a capacitive load from 0 to 50 pF and with load capability of 100 rnA. Moreover, the gain-enhanced structure provides sufficient loop gain to improve line regulation to 3. 78 mV/V and load regulation to 0. 1 mV/mA, respectively. The embedded voltage-spike detection circuit enables pseudo Class-AB operation to drive the power transistor promptly. The maximum overshoot and undershoot under a 1. 2 -V supply are less than 66 mV for full load current changes within 100 -ns <b>edge</b> <b>time,</b> and the recovery time is less than 5 mus. While the measured power consumption is only 6 muW under a 0. 75 -V supply. Guo, Jianping. Adviser: Ka Nang Leung. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73 - 06, Section: B, page:.
