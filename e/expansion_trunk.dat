40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tissue {{expanders}} {{have been}} of great value in plastic surgery. Tissue expansion was developed for a specific indication; however, within a very short time, the concept of tissue expansion found wide applicability. From 1990 to 1999, 315 expanders in 164 patients were utilized. A retrospective analysis of complications and prognostic factors for complications were done. METHODS: The indications for tissue expansion were burns (50 %), trauma (32 %), and sequelae of previous surgery (8. 8 %). The expanders were inserted most frequently in the scalp, trunk and neck. RESULTS: There were 22. 2 % of complications and the most common were expander exposure (50 %), infection (24 %) and bad function of the expander (12. 8 %). The present study revealed an increased rate of minor complications {{in the group of}} 0 to 10 years of age and an increased rate of major complications for face and neck <b>expansions</b> compared to <b>trunk</b> <b>expansion.</b> There were no increased complication rates for the other age and anatomic site groups, previous expansion, concomitant expansion and type of expander used. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes from tissue expansion procedures done in our hospital are similar to those reported in the literature. Tissue expansion is a good and safe technique...|$|R
50|$|Used {{to build}} call center {{equipment}} using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected {{at the top}} of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of <b>expansion</b> boards, including <b>trunk</b> interfaces (usually T1 or ISDN), voice processing boards equipment speech recognition or fax processing. Each board could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus.|$|R
50|$|Today, Yunnan has a {{total length}} of 167,000 km. The length of {{high-grade}} highways above Grade 2 {{adds up to}} more than 3,400 km and that of expressways amounted to nearly 1,300 km. To date, with Kunming at the nerve center and inter-provincial and intra-provincial roads as the backbone, Yunnan's highway network has stretched to cover all townships and 98 percent of the villages in the province. It is interconnected with the road network of its neighboring provinces of Sichuan,Guizhou, Guangxi, and Tibet and with the neighboring countries of Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. Yunnan is planning to focus on the upgrading and <b>expansion</b> of 6 <b>trunk</b> roads leading to other provinces and neighboring countries with the objective of turning them into a highway network.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} railway line, Hoved Line, was built between Oslo and Eidsvoll in 1854, the {{terminus}} in Oslo was constructed as an ad-hoc solution located at Gamlebyen. Alternate sites included Youngstorget, Grünerløkka and Vaterland Bridge. In 1852 an architectural competition was held, {{and a plan}} based on Crown Street Station in Liverpool won. The station was located east of the river Akerselva, but could not serve as a permanent solution, as {{it was close to}} neither the city centre nor the port. In 1859 the freight section of the station was expanded with the purchase of land between Loelva and the port, and part of Bjørvika. From the beginning, rail traffic increased, especially after the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>Trunk</b> Line to Hamar in 1862, and the opening of the Kongsvinger Line in 1865.|$|R
25|$|Den Otter (1997) {{challenges}} popular {{assumptions that}} Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans {{in the race}} for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west. The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand <b>Trunk's</b> <b>expansion</b> into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century. The Canadian Pacific, paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with James J. Hill's American railways and opened even more connections to the South. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{model of}} dorsal-fin spine growth in chondrichthyans is devised {{by studying the}} growth of spines from captive and wild Heterodontus portusjacksoni injected with several fluorochromes. Evidence was found for only two dentine layers in the spine trunk of H. portusjacksoni, contrasting with conjectures {{about the presence of}} a third middle dentine layer in some squalids. The spines have three simultaneous growth zones. The first growth zone is along the internal edge of the inner trunk dentine layer, where growth bands are deposited towards the centre (centripetally), increasing spine length and width by pressure against the cartilage rod. The second growth zone is along the external edge of the outer trunk dentine layer at the spine base, where growth bands are deposited in an opposite direction to the centre (centrifugally), increasing spine width. A third growth zone {{at the base of the}} cap enables downward <b>expansion</b> over the <b>trunk.</b> The model of concentric cones describes correctly the inner dentine layer growth pattern, whereas the outer dentine layer growth increments appear to be related to the external bands on the surface of the trunk. Growth increments from the three growth zones of the spine are all potentially useful for age estimation...|$|R
40|$|Cladoxylopsida {{included}} the earliest large trees that formed critical components of globally transformative pioneering forest ecosystems in the Mid- and early Late Devonian (ca. 393 – 372 Ma). Well-known cladoxylopsid fossils include the up to ∼ 1 -m-diameter sandstone casts known as Eospermatopteris from Middle Devonian strata of New York State. Cladoxylopsid trunk structure comprised a more-or-less distinct cylinder of numerous separate cauline xylem strands connected internally with {{a network of}} medullary xylem strands and, near the base, externally with downward-growing roots, all embedded within parenchyma. However, {{the means by which}} this complex vascular system was able to grow to a large diameter is unknown. We demonstrate—based on exceptional, up to ∼ 70 -cm-diameter silicified fossil trunks with extensive preservation of cellular anatomy from the early Late Devonian (Frasnian, ca. 374 Ma) of Xinjiang, China—that <b>trunk</b> <b>expansion</b> is associated with a cylindrical zone of diffuse secondary growth within ground and cortical parenchyma and with production of a large amount of wood containing both rays and growth increments concentrically around individual xylem strands by normal cambia. The xylem system accommodates expansion by tearing of individual strand interconnections during secondary development. This mode of growth seems indeterminate, capable of producing trees of large size and, despite some unique features, invites comparison with secondary development in some living monocots. Understanding the structure and growth of cladoxylopsids informs analysis of canopy competition within early forests with the potential to drive global processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{vascular}} {{factor in}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affecting its development and progression, {{is one of}} the most urgent problems of modern neuroangiology. The research investigates the characteristics of cerebral angioarchitectonics identified at different stages of AD. The research included 106 patients: 1) The Test Group— 47 patients suffering from various stages of AD; 2) The Control Group— 59 patients suffering from the most common lesions of the brain accompanied by neurodegenerative changes, the development of dementia and cognitive impairment, but not having AD. All the patients underwent: the testing of cognitive functions (MMSE), the determination of severity of dementia (CDR) and AD stages (TDR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), scintigraphy of the brain (SG), rheoencephalography (REG), and cerebral multigated angiography (MUGA). Patients with AD different stages showed the following changes in angioarchitectonics and microcirculation: Absence of pronounced atherosclerotic lesions of intracranial vessels, reduction of the capillary bed in the temporal and temporo-parietal regions, development of multiple arteriovenous shunts in the same areas, early venous discharge, abnormal <b>expansion</b> of venous <b>trunks</b> that receive blood from arteriovenous shunts, venous congestion at the border of the frontal and parietal region, increased looping of intracranial arteries. Control Group patients had no combination of the abovementioned changes. These vascular changes are specific for AD and are in fact the vascular factor of this disease; they may also be called dyscirculatory angiopathy of Alzheimer’s type (DAAT). Patients suffering from other diseases that are accompanied by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, dementia and cognitive impairment do not have them...|$|R
40|$|Transformation of culture, {{although}} modern in {{investigation of}} the present moment, {{is not only the}} speciality of our time. Every great change of historical period was in fact a cultural change. In the past this process was very slow because the patterns did not reach all the people so quickly as to-day the west-european and American civilization does by means of TV, film and press. These new processes did not extend themselves everywhere the same, because somewhere the old, even the ancient, persisted up to now. Such very important historical events took place on our territory and manifested itself in some forms of bee-hives. In the Mediterranean and some parts belonging to the old megalith culture, stone hives made out of stone blocks were built into a stone wall. To-day such hives are known in the Baleares (Spain), Apulia (Italy) and on Brač and Hvar. Such had the old Romans too. Keeping the bee-hives in walls is not a rarity (Mediterranean, Orient). This particular way of keeping bees reminds us of bee boles, niches in stone fences or walls of houses from the 15 th - 18 th century in England and on the Isle of Man. Before these stone hives, much simpler forms can be found in our country. There is a custom in preparing niches on the banks of rivers or in cliffs where wild bees come to swarm. People then take such swarms home and in this way the number of their bee-hives increase. This custom dominates in Macedonia and similar niches in stone are known in the parts around Obrovac. Something similar existed among the Čeramis on Volga Bee-hives in tree trunks are very ancient. The honey is collected {{from the bottom of the}} trunk and such bee-hives are known in the whole of the Roman Europe. The Slavs accepted this form probably because of its simple form and simple handling, and that 2 ̆ 7 s why we can explain its general expansion; while the Slavic form, the trunk bee-hive with a door opposite the flight of the bees, is rarely mentioned. Bee-hives in the form of standing boxes, show the same <b>expansion</b> as <b>trunk</b> bee-hives. The speciality of both in Dalmatia is a stone tile roof. In Slovenia such wooden boxes, in a horizontal line, completely belong to the alpen cultural areal and represents the youngest form of bee-hives in the Alps; they are thought to be late Roman origin. No doubt the custom of keeping bees in stave vessels in northern Dalmatia belongs to the Roman influence which appeared after 1 st century A. D. Bee hives weaved from twigs, in the past existed in the whole country. In Panonia they were displaced with the straw weaved hives which came to our parts from the middle Europe through Hungary, and the Government of the Military Border intensively worked on their expansion...|$|R
