5000|$|Earlier in the week, Syria {{had twice}} {{attacked}} an Israeli tractor {{working in the}} DMZ area. When the tractor returned {{on the morning of}} April 7, 1967, as predicted in the plan, the Syrians opened fire again initially with light weapons. The Israelis responded by sending in armor-plated tractors to continue ploughing, resulting in further exchanges of fire. The resulting tit-for-tat escalated, leading to tanks, heavy mortars, machine guns, and artillery being used in various sections along the 47 mile (76 km) border in what was described as [...] "a dispute over cultivation rights in the demilitarized zone south-east of Lake Tiberias." [...] At this point the critical departure from previous incidents occurred. Without advance planning nor having been submitted <b>for</b> <b>prior</b> <b>approval</b> to the Ministerial Committee on Security, Israeli aircraft dive-bombed Syrian positions with 250 and 500 kg bombs. For the first time the IAF was employed before an Israeli settlement had actually been shelled (with the exception of stray shells which fell in Tel Katzir) and Israeli planes penetrated as far as Damascus. The Syrians then responded by shelling Israeli border settlements heavily, and Israeli jets retaliated by bombing the village of Sqoufiye, destroying around 40 houses in the process. At 15:19 Syrian shells started falling on Kibbutz Gadot; over 300 landed within the kibbutz compound in 40 minutes. The [...] "incident" [...] had escalated into a full-scale aerial battle over the Golan Heights after Israel scrambled jets, resulting in the loss of six Syrian Air Force MiG-21s to Israeli Air Force Dassault Mirage IIIs, and the latter's flight over Damascus. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) attempted to arrange a ceasefire, but Syria declined to co-operate unless Israeli agricultural work was halted. The Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote [...] "This was not an 'incident' but a real war." [...] Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union intervened to halt the downward course of events and to deter Israel by activating the Egyptian-Syrian defense pact signed in November 1966 under Soviet pressure for this precise purpose.|$|E

30|$|The TEWA {{requires}} that covered employers must seek {{the consent of}} the Commissioner General of Labor (CGL) before they are allowed to dismiss workers, even if it concerns a single worker. The CGL may refuse to sanction the layoff or, if permission is granted, the employer will be required to pay severance in an amount determined by the CGL. Over the sample period, the procedure by which the severance is determined was not specified in law but was subject to a lengthy and seemingly arbitrary deliberation. In December 2003, the TEWA switched to a formula-based severance payment that is uniformly applied to all firms. While that amendment eliminated the ad hoc determination of the level of severance pay, the other elements of the policy, including the need <b>for</b> <b>prior</b> <b>approval</b> of layoffs, are still in place.|$|E

40|$|When {{conducting}} {{health and}} medical research {{it is not}} only important to do the research ethically, but also to apply <b>for</b> <b>prior</b> ethical <b>approval</b> from the relevant authorities. The latter requirement is true for developed countries as well as developing countries. We argue that simply applying for research ethics approval from an institutional review board at a university based in a developed country is not enough to start a health research project in a developing country. The paper also suggests a number of reasons why researchers may fail to seek local research ethics permission in developing countries. We use a recent paper reporting research conducted in Nepal and published in an international journal as a case study to highlight the importance of being sensitive to local requirements regarding applying for and registering health and medical research...|$|R
