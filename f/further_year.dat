5|$|Between 1987 and 1998, the {{development}} corporation attracted 1,000companies, generating 28,299new jobs and £1.759billion of private sector investment. The setting {{up of the}} corporation {{was intended to be}} only a temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a <b>further</b> <b>year</b> until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Director Doug Liman {{has said}} that he had been a fan of the source novel by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of {{production}} of Liman's previous film Swingers, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from Warner Bros. and a <b>further</b> <b>year</b> of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights to Ludlum's books in the hopes of starting a new film franchise. William Blake Herron was brought in to rewrite the script in 1999.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November 2013, Manchester United {{announced}} that Carrick {{had signed a}} contract extension until 2015, with the option to extend for a <b>further</b> <b>year.</b> In the 2013–14 season, Carrick struggled to retain his previous season's form, as Manchester United struggled generally under new manager David Moyes. His season was not helped by a persistent achilles problem that kept him out from November until December, whilst new signings in midfield such as Marouane Fellaini had failed to perform.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of 2012–13, Charles {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with the club. He started in the club's first match of the season, a 3–1 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, playing the whole match at left back. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town on 1 September 2012, after cutting in from the wing to strike into the top corner to restore parity in the match. It turned out to be his only goal of the season as Charles played most of the season at left back, making 41 appearances during the season. With a year remaining on his current deal, Charles' contract was extended for a <b>further</b> <b>year</b> in June 2013, keeping him contracted to the club until the summer of 2015. He made a goalscoring start to 2013–14, scoring after pouncing on a loose ball in a 4–3 home defeat to Oldham Athletic on the opening day of the season.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Holroyd {{signed for}} Conference National side Cambridge United on a one-year contract, with {{the option of}} a <b>further</b> <b>year.</b> Holroyd made his debut for Cambridge in the club's 3–0 away win at Eastbourne Borough, coming on as a 79th-minute {{substitute}} and scoring five minutes later to give Cambridge a three-goal lead. After scoring on his debut, Holroyd went sixteen games without scoring, ending his goal drought in a 4–0 victory over Salisbury City in December 2008. In February 2009, Holroyd scored in successive away victories for Cambridge, scoring from the penalty spot against Rushden & Diamonds, before scoring twice away at Kidderminster Harriers. A month later, he scored three goals within the space of three days, scoring two second-half goals in Cambridge's 2–0 win at Barrow, as well as netting against Northwich Victoria. Holroyd scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot as Cambridge came from a goal behind to beat Eastbourne Borough 2–1. Two days later, he scored once more, again from the penalty spot, this time away at Kettering Town. Holroyd also featured in all three of Cambridge's play-off games, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute in Cambridge's 2–0 loss in the final to Torquay United.

5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a <b>further</b> <b>year,</b> a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
5|$|Following its closure at {{the start}} of the 1705 Lenten season, the Gänsemarkt did not reopen until August, by which time Keiser had {{returned}} from Weissenfels to produce his opera Octavia. From this point, Handel's regular connection with the theatre appears to have diminished. Although he remained in Hamburg for a <b>further</b> <b>year,</b> his main source of income was from private lessons, as he saved for his long-desired visit to Italy. He nevertheless accepted a commission from the Gänsemarkt to compose a setting for a large-scale opera based on the Greek myth of Apollo and Daphne. With its rambling plot and an assortment of dances and other set pieces—almost 100 musical numbers in all—the work was eventually divided into two separate operas, for performance on successive nights. The two sections were given the formal names Der beglückte Florindo ("Florindo made happy") and Die verwandelte Daphne ("Daphne metamorphosed"), but are generally known as Florindo and Daphne. It is not known when Handel wrote the music. He may have completed it in 1705–06 while still in Hamburg, or it may have been composed in Italy after arriving there in the latter part of 1706.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2016, Barcelona's {{transfer}} ban ended. The same day, they registered 77 players {{across all}} categories and ages, and both last summer signings Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal became eligible {{to play with}} the first team. On 10 February, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey. With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season. After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, the run has ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons with a 3–0 win in {{the final day of the}} season at Granada. On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League in 2nd Leg, beating Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0. On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor signing a two-year contract with an option for a <b>further</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|Seamer {{graduated}} in 1935, but returned to Oxford for a <b>further</b> <b>year</b> to study Arabic. In his {{final year of}} cricket at Oxford, he only appeared in three matches: he was not required to bat in either innings against the Free Foresters, and only batted once against Leicestershire, scoring 5 runs. Out of form and not required for the university team, {{he went off to}} play for Somerset in the match against Cambridge University and scored 68. He followed that with a further game for Somerset in which he was not successful and travelled with the Somerset side for the next match against Glamorgan at Llanelli, but Mitchell-Innes, as Oxford captain, called him up as cover for the injured Roger Kimpton; {{on the morning of the}} match, The Times reported that Kimpton was likely to play and Seamer would be stood down. In the event, Kimpton failed his fitness test and Seamer's final match for the university team was the University match against Cambridge, and as in the previous year, Oxford suffered a heavy defeat. Seamer scored 11 runs in the first innings, and then when Oxford were asked to follow on, he batted tenaciously to reach 43 runs, which forced Cambridge to bat again. Requiring 17 runs to win, Cambridge chased the total down in 5.4 overs with eight wickets to spare. In total, Seamer played 21 matches for Oxford, scoring 1,059 runs at an average of 35.30.|$|E
