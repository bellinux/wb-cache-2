30|$|Galp Energia {{refer to}} their {{refinery}} as a <b>hydroskimmer,</b> {{and although the}} complexity index exceeds the normal cutoff of a “simple” US refinery, the classification is appropriate since the facility does not contain any conversion processes. Aromatics contribute about 40 % of the complexity score, and because the plant also produces lubricants, base oils, and solvents, if located in the US the refinery would be called a fuels-lubes plant.|$|E

The trans-media {{aircraft}} is the {{new concept}} amphibious aircraft, which has been affect by aerodynamic force and hydrodynamic force, and kinetics of it {{are different from the}} normal aircraft and planning boat. Based on the aerodynamic and the theory of planning, this paper presents a bouncing vehicle shape base on the shape of <b>hydroskimmer,</b> uses the ALE method to study the skipping. Emphatically analyzed the influence factors of vehicle bounce and movement characteristics. It gives theoretical foundation and study tools for the conceptual design of trans-media, ballistics design optimization and flight stability assessment. ...|$|E
30|$|Simple {{refineries}} {{are often}} referred to as topping or hydroskimming plants since they only split crude oil into its main components and perform basic finishing operations. Topping facilities are basically just a distillation tower, while <b>hydroskimmers</b> also contain reforming and hydrotreating, and sometimes aromatics recovery units. Simple refineries maintain a high straight run fuel oil production and produce a high straight run fuel oil. Most coking facilities have cracking capacity, but not all cracking facilities have cokers. Coking refineries upgrade most of the fuel oil to lighter products.|$|R
