5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in the wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley {{is a serious problem}} during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b>|$|E

5|$|The newly {{independent}} Pixar (1986) was headed by Edwin Catmull as President and Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. While looking for investors, Steve Jobs was interested, but Lucas found his offer too low. Yet he accepted {{it in the}} end after {{it turned out to}} be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> other investors. Jobs, who had recently been fired from Apple Computer, paid $5million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5million cash as capital into the company, and joined the board of directors as chairman.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

30|$|After obtaining all {{parameters}} of the pair of conics, the four intersection points of two conics on the model plane and their projections can be computed. But consequently, {{the problem of how}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the correct correspondences arises. For real intersection points, people may manually select the correct correspondences in the image as the popular calibration tool does [25]. For complex intersection points without physical position, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> directly <b>find</b> their correspondences in the image.|$|R
5|$|It {{had taken}} {{a decade and a}} half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E

Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them {{off on a}} seemingly <b>impossible</b> journey <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a relative they do not even know.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, making it <b>impossible</b> for Coffin <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a replacement <b>to</b> run the company {{so that he could}} return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> maintain a profitable business.|$|R

25|$|Finding coal {{for heat}} in winter was another preoccupation. The Germans had {{transferred}} the {{authority over the}} coal mines of northern France from Paris to their military headquarters in Brussels. The priority for the coal that did arrive in Paris was for the use in factories.

25|$|By late 1929, Goddard {{had been}} {{attracting}} additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding {{it increasingly difficult}} to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work, and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> following the recent U.S. stock market crash in October 1929.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s brought {{important}} changes. Zalaegerszeg got a more industrial profile {{with the}} construction of the textile factory and the discovery of oil resources in 1952. The railway line was expanded, too. Lots of workers were commuting from the nearby villages, because it was almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a flat in the city, so several residents of Zalaegerszeg (mostly those who were considered to be opposed to the Socialist system) were forced to relocate.|$|E

The notion of a long run, of course, is all that keeps hope alive." ...|$|R
