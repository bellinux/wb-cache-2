40|$|The {{present study}} {{establishes}} relationships between structure and reactivity for the pyrroloquinoline and phenanthroline quinones. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>reductions</b> of 1, 7 - and 1, 10 -phenanthroline- 5, 6 -quinones, like other quinones, are reversible and occur by 2 e- transfer {{in a single}} step in aqueous solution and by two 1 e(-) -transfer steps in aprotic media. The electron-withdrawing pyridine moieties both increase their potentials and stabilize their aprotic semiquinones. The electrochemistry of the cofactor methoxatin and its trimethylester derivative {{is similar to the}} phenanthroline quinones in aqueous solution. However, the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>reductions</b> of methoxatin and its triester in aprotic solutions are characterized by at least three potentials, each accounting for less than 1 e-. This has been explained by the proposal of semiquinone complexing with itself and with quinone. Despite an electron-donating pyrrole moiety, methoxatin and its trimethylester have relatively high potentials in aprotic solution. This is presumably due to stabilization of radical anions by the aforementioned complexing or by delocalization with carboxylic acid and ester groups. The reduction potential of methoxatin, in both aqueous and aprotic solvent, suggests that oxidation of methanol should be a thermodynamically favorable process. No evidence for an electrochemically reduced state lower than the quinol was found for any of the compounds. Chemical reactivity is influenced by the orientation of the pyridine nitrogen.
