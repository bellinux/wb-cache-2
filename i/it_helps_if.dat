2500|$|Due to {{the flawed}} {{research}} that has been conducted in the past, many stereotypes have followed ACOAs. ACOAs {{have been identified as}} having a variety of emotional and behavioral problems, such as sleep problems, aggression and lowered self-esteem. [...] When it comes to being a COA or ACOA, there is still hope. Results showed that a supportive and loving relationship with one of the parents can counterbalance the possible negative effects of the relationship with the alcoholic parent. When there is one alcoholic parent in the household, <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>if</b> the child relies on other family members for support. It may be the second parent, siblings or members of the extended family. Having other supportive family members can help the child feel like s/he is not alone. Younger generations of ACOAs scored more positively, in terms of coping mechanisms. This may be due to fact that alcoholism is seen more as an illness nowadays, rather than a moral defect. There has been less victim blaming of alcoholism on parent’s, because it has now been declared a disease rather than a behavioral problem. Studies show that when ACOAs use positive coping mechanisms, it is related to more positive results. When an ACOA approaches their issues, rather than avoids them, it often relates to having a positive outlook. Studies have shown that ACOAs and COAs have more compulsive behaviors that may cause the need for higher achievement. Some ACOAs have shown {{that the only way to}} survive is to fend for themselves. This causes a sense of independence that helps them become more self-reliant. Because they perceive that independence and hard work as necessary, ACOAs develop a sense of survival instinct.|$|E

Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as single point tolerant, and represents {{the vast majority of}} fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the mean time between failures should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices (mean time to repair) before the backup also fails. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>if</b> the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} fictional {{embodiment}} {{of the world of}} the self-help book is Bridget Jones. Taking 'self-help books...as a new form of religion' - 'a kind of secularised religion - a sort of moral values lite' - she struggles to integrate its often conflicting instructions into a coherent whole. 'She must stop beating herself over the head with Women Who Love Too Much and instead think more towards Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus...see Richard's behaviour less as a sign that she is co-dependent and loving too much and more in the light of him being like a Martian rubber band'. Even she, however, has the occasional crisis of faith, when she wonders: 'Maybe <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>if</b> you've never read a self-help book in your life'.|$|E

But Milly falling in love with a shadow - actually more like a projection of a man on to the side of a van that miraculously happens outside her flat every night - well, that's just stupid. And I don't like its irritating jazzy soundtrack, or how small and British it all feels (and I mean both in the worst possible way). Love Soup is insipid broth and I've had enough already." ...|$|E
50|$|Plan some {{behavior}} {{that is likely to}} work better. The client is likely to need some suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>if</b> the plan itself comes from the client. It is important that the initial steps be small enough that the client is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.In many cases, the client's problem {{is the result of a}} bad relationship with someone, and since the client cannot change anyone else's behavior, the therapist will focus on things the client can do unilaterally. The client may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not reciprocate, but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage the client to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains the client long enough for them to establish these other relationships.|$|E

Given a chance and some decent budgets, you just know these two talented animators are going to go on to bigger and better things. We were also very impressed by their ability to self promote via their website.”.Ian Lumsden World animation blogger adds [...] "I first noticed their music video Thou Shalt Always Kill when I previewed the weekend's BAF 07. It was most professionally done. I was therefore impressed to discover it was produced by a fledgling studio. Also surprising is the diversity of work produced {{in a short period of}} time .........Sometimes the combination of live action and animation jars. This is decidedly not the case here. Filters, excellent lighting, interesting camera angles and stop motion techniques, together with animated twinkling effects lead naturally into the interspersed animated sections. Their website is developing apace and belies its short life........A perfect blend of traditional animation and eye popping contemporary film-making. Karen is a fizzing PR machine and <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>if</b> you have quality to sell because they are pretty special in that department too .....There is a beauty bestowed on the scene and always there is an edgy magic to the production.

40|$|We {{study the}} extent to which complex {{hardware}} can speed up routing. Specifically, we consider the following questions. How much does adaptive routing improve over oblivious routing? How much does randomness <b>help?</b> How does <b>it</b> <b>help</b> <b>if</b> each node can have a large number of neighbors? What benefit is available if a node can send packets to several neighbors within a single time step? Some of these features require complex networking hardware, and it is thus important to investigate whether the performance justifies the investment. By varying these hardware parameters, we obtain a hierarchy of time bounds for worst-case permutation routing...|$|R
