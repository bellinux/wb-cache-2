During this process, parts of the aircraft including undercarriage, engines, wings and tail section sheared off. There were 32 fatalities, with the sole survivor a Congolese journalist.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 {{the airport}} {{was awarded a}} $6.5 million Airport Improvement Program grant to {{accomplish}} major updates to the facility. [...] Included among the projects were the resurfacing of Runway 13/31, {{as well as the}} relocation of the ILS glideslope & MALSR due to the creation of an 800' <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> on <b>Runway</b> 13 to comply with FAA runway safety area standards. Additionally, former taxiway H (at the intersection of 18/36 and 13/31) was demolished after being identified as a potential [...] "hot spot" [...] for runway incursions. [...] The improvements were completed in 2009.|$|R

50|$|Solberg Airport is {{situated}} on 725 wide open acres in Readington, NJ, and contains two runways. The primary runway is 22/4 measuring 3,735 x 50 ft (1,138 x 15 m). 3,000 ft (914 m) of this runway is paved with asphalt, and 735 ft (224 m) is turf reserved as a <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold.</b> The second <b>runway,</b> 13/31, is turf measuring 3,442 x 200 ft (1,049 x 61 m).|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 Runway 16/34 was {{shortened}} to 7,100 feet to {{make room}} for an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). The EMAS is a bed of material that will crush under the weight of an aircraft, stopping the aircraft {{in the event of a}} runway overrun. [...] In 2003 the airport was again renamed to the Greater Binghamton Airport. The airport's old linear terminal was unable to keep up with regional jet traffic, and four new jet bridges opened in July 2004. BGM got a 12.3 million dollar federal grant in September 2011 to replace the old EMAS system installed in 2002 and extend Runway 16 and 34 to 7,304 feet. The extension project was completed in November 2012 and implemented a <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> on <b>Runway</b> 34.|$|R
50|$|Bunbury Airport has {{a single}} sealed runway, 07/25 which is 1222 x 18 m wide. Due to the {{proximity}} of the South Western Highway, there is a 206 m permanently <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> at the <b>runway</b> 25 end to allow sufficient clearance over the road. Because of this, the available landing distance is 1015 m. The airport is currently restricted to aircraft with a maximum take-off weight less than 5700 kg. Runway 07/25 is equipped with low intensity, pilot activated runway lighting for night operations. There is no control tower and pilots must co-ordinate arrivals and departures using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency.|$|R
500|$|Midway is {{surrounded}} by buildings and other development, so the landing <b>thresholds</b> of the <b>runways</b> are displaced to provide obstacle clearance. The FAA and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the <b>displaced</b> landing <b>thresholds,</b> the <b>runways</b> have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of [...] in the southeast direction, and [...] to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the Boeing 757. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the closure of Oxnard AFB in January 1970, the County of Ventura actively pursued the acquisition of the former military base property from the Department of Defense for commercial airport use. This initiative ran into public opposition, opposed primarily by local residents concerned about the noise of growing commercial traffic. In 1976, {{the transfer of the}} airport was finally approved, provided the runway length was shortened to 6,000 ft by <b>displacing</b> the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold</b> on one end. By 1985, the airport was entirely managed by the Ventura County Department of Airports.|$|R
50|$|Runway 28 has a 75 m <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold.</b> The Manizales VOR-DME (Ident: MZL) {{is located}} 3.7 nmi km {{west of the}} <b>Runway</b> 10 <b>threshold.</b> The <b>runway</b> has a steep dropoff into a river valley to the south. There is high terrain {{north and south of}} the airport.|$|R
