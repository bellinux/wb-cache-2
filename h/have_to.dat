5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a couple of flat streets.|$|E

He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in perfect health, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know how to ride, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know how to shoot. To these {{conditions}} were afterward added two more: each man <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn his duty {{as quickly as he}} could and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to obey his superiors.|$|R

5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that he might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to a siege.|$|E

5|$|If that is so, {{it is not}} unthinkable that {{circumstances}} could arise {{where the}} courts may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism. In exceptional circumstances involving an attempt to abolish judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or a new Supreme Court may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider {{whether this is a}} constitutional fundamental which even a sovereign Parliament acting at the behest of a complaisant House of Commons cannot abolish.|$|E
50|$|It {{was quite}} a {{struggle}} in putting up a new educational system right after the Philippine-American War. New buildings <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be constructed; supplies, books and other instructional materials <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be procured. Pampangan native teachers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn the English language and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be trained in new methods of teaching. The cooperation of parents and local government officials <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be solicited also.|$|R

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates <b>have</b> <b>to</b> expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
50|$|If {{the least}} {{subnormal}} value (second line above) should be 1, {{the value of}} x <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be x = 3.

5|$|Young's {{claims that}} the new decipherments were merely a {{corroboration}} of his own method, meant that Champollion would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> publish more of his data to make clear {{the degree to which}} his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.|$|E
