5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E

5|$|I {{really wanted}} {{to sit down with}} Wale before <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E

Or the heart dimly lit, {{sputtering}} and darkening, the heart shattering and held together again with duct tape and kindergarten paste. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> by memory, which is a beautiful liar. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> lies. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> in an alternate universe, in bed, hating {{the world and the}} word 2 ̆ 2 I. 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>write</b> at a desk and feel virtuous. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> without a thought in my head. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> groveling for love and attention, and indifferent to everyone and everything...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, It <b>Is</b> <b>Written</b> {{expanded}} to Brazil and asked Feyerabend to assist them. The contacts made {{during this time}} led to Mark Finley inviting Henry to become the director of It <b>Is</b> <b>Written</b> Canada. It <b>Is</b> <b>Written</b> was soon nationally televised weekly in Canada, with Feyerabend as preacher.

5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|Harihara, (also {{known as}} Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha <b>I,</b> <b>wrote</b> the Girijakalyana {{in the old}} Jain Champu style which {{describes}} the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections. He {{was one of the}} earliest Virashaiva writers who {{was not part of the}} vachana literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (Karanikas) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred ragales (poems in blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the Shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his Harishchandra kavya which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
