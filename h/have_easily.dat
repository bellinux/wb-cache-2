5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} Germanicus' death {{his sister}} Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus' only {{remaining}} son Caligula became emperor and renamed September Germanicus {{in honor of his}} father. Many Romans, in the account of Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to King Alexander the Great, and believed that he would <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor. In book eight of his Natural History, Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse Bucephalus died he named a city Bucephalia in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus' horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote a poem about.|$|E

5|$|Author Masaru Takeuchi {{attributes}} {{the origin of}} the quick time event game mechanic to laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. IGN's Levi Buchanan listed FMV games like Time Gal as one of the reasons behind the Mega-CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

5|$|Polistes exclamans is {{a social}} wasp and {{is part of the}} family Vespidae of the order Hymenoptera. It is found {{throughout}} the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas and parts of Canada. Due to solitary nest founding by queens, P. exclamans has extended its range {{in the past few decades}} and now covers the eastern half of the United States, as well as part of the north. This expansion is typically attributed to changing global climate and temperatures. P. exclamans has three specific castes, including males, workers, and queens, but the dominance hierarchy is further distinguished by age. The older the wasp is, the higher it is in ranking within the colony. In most P. exclamans nests, there is one queen who lays all the eggs in the colony. The physiological similarities between the worker and queen castes have led to experiments attempting to distinguish the characteristics of these two castes and how they are determined, though males <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> identifiable physiological characteristics. Since P. exclamans live in relatively small, open combed nests, they are often subject to predators and parasites, such as Chalcoela iphitalis, Elasmus polistis, and birds. P. exclamans have defense and recognition strategies that help protect against these predators and parasites.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E

25|$|Upon Thutmose's coronation, Kush rebelled, {{as it had}} {{the habit}} of doing upon the {{transition}} of Egyptian kingship. The Nubian state had been completely subjugated by Thutmose I, but some rebels from Khenthennofer rose up, and the Egyptian colonists retreated into a fortress built by Thutmose I. On account of his relative youth at the time, Thutmose II dispatched an army into Nubia rather than leading it himself, {{but he seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> crushed this revolt with the aid of his father's military generals. An account of the campaign is given by the historian Josephus who refers to it as the Ethiopic War.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} text, the Inscription of Mes, {{records that}} {{a court case}} decision was rendered in favour of a rival branch of Mes' family in Year 59 of Horemheb. Since the Mes inscription was composed {{during the reign of}} Ramesses II when the Amarna-era Pharaohs were struck from the official king-lists, the Year 59 Horemheb date certainly includes the nearly 17-year-long reign of Akhenaten, the 2-year independent reign of Neferneferuaten, the 9-year reign of Tutankhamun and the 4-year reign of Ay. Once all these rulers reigns are deducted from the Year 59 date, Horemheb would still <b>have</b> <b>easily</b> enjoyed a reign of 26–27 years.|$|E
25|$|Jeremy Sonnenfeld of Sioux Falls, S.D. made bowling {{history on}} February 2, 1997 {{when he became}} the first person ever to roll three {{certified}} perfect games in a three-game set, or a 900 series. Sonnenfeld was not the first person to shoot a 900 series, but his was the first recognized by ABC. Former PBA bowler Glenn Allison submitted the first-ever 900 series for award consideration, when he accomplished the feat on July 1, 1982. But the ABC refused to certify the score, citing non-compliant lane conditions.
