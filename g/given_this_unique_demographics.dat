40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. We present a field experiment designed to examine the discriminatory motives of an understudied demographic: the poorest people in England. Subjects are first asked to divide £ 10 between two strangers, and then play a £ 10 dictator game with another stranger. We subtly vary the ethnicity of the receivers by providing subjects with surnames randomly drawn from the electoral register, including treatments {{that allow us to}} parse behaviour into either in–group favouritism or out–group negativity, an important behavioural distinction that is typically overlooked in the discrimination literature. Our results suggest that the observed discriminatory attitudes are the result of out-group negativity rather than in-group favouritism. We advance the literature on discrimination through the estimation of a structural model of group– contingent social preferences, which we exploit to perform counterfactual simulations. Our results provide insights into the behaviour of <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> <b>demographic</b> and provide a rationale for why they may support discriminatory policies in their voting behaviour...|$|R

The aim of this research is to give voice to these young people, specifically HIV positive students, in the rural, post-conflict area of Katakwi, Uganda. Through the lens of empowerment, which focuses on participation, capacity building, leadership potential, and relationships, this research examines the factors in these students’ lives that contribute to their empowerment, or the absence of these factors that then have the potential to disempower them. It considers the way the students themselves see both the protective and risk elements in their lives, and how they deal with stigma, school, and identity as a person living with HIV/AIDS. The data in this work is collected through semi-structured interviews with sixteen adolescent students living in Katakwi. These sixteen students, a mixture of males and females, have varying levels of openness about discussing their HIV status. Additional interviews conducted with teachers, parents, and health care workers connected to students with HIV/AIDS creates a total of 25 participants. The diversity of stories within the voices of these sixteen students makes it clear that <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> <b>demographic</b> is not a homogenous population, and the levels of empowerment vary based on gender, family support, means of infection, faith in God, relationships with peers and teachers, and age.

40|$|Selection of {{appropriate}} oviposition sites {{is essential for}} progeny survival and fitness in generalist insect species, such as Drosphila melanogaster, yet {{little is known about}} the mechanisms regulating how environmental conditions and innate adult preferences are evaluated and balanced to yield the final substrate choice for egg-deposition. Female D. melanogaster are attracted to food containing acetic acid (AA) as an oviposition substrate. However, our observations reveal that this egg-laying preference is a complex process, as it directly opposes an otherwise strong, default behavior of positional avoidance for the same food. We show that 2 distinct sensory modalities detect AA. Attraction to AA-containing food for the purpose of egg-laying relies on the gustatory system, while positional repulsion depends primarily on the olfactory system. Similarly, distinct central brain regions are involved in AA attraction and repulsion. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> situation, in which a single environmental stimulus yields 2 opposing behavioral outputs, we propose that the interaction of egg-laying attraction and positional aversion for AA provides a powerful model for studying how organisms balance competing behavioral drives and integrate signals involved in choice-like processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus, {{the most}} common cause of wound infection, {{produces}} several exotoxins, including superantigens (SAgs). SAgs are the potent activators of the immune system. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> property, we hypothesized that SAgs produced by S. aureus in wounds would have local, as well as systemic immunologic effects. We tested our hypothesis using a novel staphylococcal skin wound infection model in transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR 3.

Animals with wounds challenged with SAg-producing S. aureus had increased morbidity and lower serum IL- 17 levels compared to those challenged with the SAg non-producing S. aureus (p = 0. 027 and p = 0. 032, respectively). At Day 8 following microbial challenge, compared to mice with uninfected wounds, the proportion of Vβ 8 +CD 4 + T cells was increased, while the proportion of Vβ 8 +CD 8 + T cells was decreased only in the spleens of mice challenged with SAg-producing S. aureus (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Under {{the land}} {{regulations}} set {{out by the}} Canadian government in 1871, single women 1 were not eligible to obtain a free homestead of 160 acres in the western Canadian prairie region. Rather, their male counterparts, those who were eighteen {{years of age and}} older, were deemed to be acceptable candidates and entitled to qualify for the quarter-sections. However, by 1908, single women finally obtained an opportunity to register for homestead land, follow the homestead regulations, and gain title to property. This was done through The Volunteer Bounty Act of 1908. While the primary purpose of this Act was to benefit Canadian soldiers who had volunteered and fought in South Africa in the Boer War (1899 - 1902) by granting them 320 acres of free homestead land in the western prairie region, the Act allowed soldiers to name a substitute; that is, any adult individual who would assume full responsibility for the property and follow homestead regulations.

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to make a threat, {{and under}} what {{circumstances}} can a speaker be convicted for making one? This Note examines these questions in light of Elonis v. United States, a Supreme Court case decided in June 2015. There, the Court held that when a speaker subjectively intends a statement be taken as a threat or knows that it will be taken as a threat, she may be convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 875 (c). The Court did not decide whether a speaker who recklessly makes a threat may be convicted under the statute. This Note argues that convicting a reckless speaker would be consistent with both principles of statutory interpretation and the First Amendment. It advocates for this result particularly because it would protect victims of domestic violence. This Note argues that courts should interpret the statute to allow a speaker who makes a threat recklessly to be convicted for three reasons. First, such interpretation is consistent with principles of statutory interpretation. Second, it is consistent with the First Amendment.

40|$|Prior {{developmental}} genetic analyses {{have shown}} that labial (lab) and Deformed (Dfd) are homeotic genes that function {{in the development of}} the embryonic (larval) and adult head. Using antibody probes to reveal the spatial distribution of the lab and Dfd proteins in embryonic and imaginal tissues, we have assessed the respective roles of these genes through an analysis of the correspondence of their expression patterns with their mutant phenotypes. With regard to imaginal develop-ment, lab and Dfd occupy adjacent non-overlapping expression domains in the peripodial cell layer of the eye—antennal disc, in patterns that are consistent with their adult mutant phenotypes and published fate maps. During embryogenesis, lab and Dfd exhibit limited overlapping expression in areas that are of no obvious significance to the development of larval head struc-tures, but also in areas that may have consequences for imaginal development. The head of Drosophila and other cyclorrhaphous Dipterans is characterized by an ex-treme morphological difference between the larval and adult stages. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> ontogenetic and phylo-genetic history and the observation that homeotic transformations produced by the lab, Dfd, and probosci-pedia (pb) loci are manifested only in the adult, we suggest that distinct regulatory paradigms evolved for homeotic gene function {{in the development of the}} larval versus adult head.

40|$|Professional {{paper for}} the {{fulfillment}} of the Masters of Public PolicyThis paper discusses how building the capacity of charter school boards of directors to govern more effectively could contribute to improving accountability in Minnesota. State legislation has enacted an elaborate system of charter school accountability that is intended to submit schools to accountability from three main sources: bureaucratic authority, market and performance. Yet, more than 15 {{years after the first}} charter school opened in Minnesota, there is compelling evidence to suggest that this system is not effective. Though many stakeholders play a role in this failure, charter school boards of directors play a unique role in holding schools accountable, as they lie at the confluence of regulatory, market and performance accountability. They have a statutory obligation to conduct fiduciary oversight to ensure that their schools conduct themselves legally and responsibly. The board is a key party in a performance contract with the school’s authorizer. Unlike other stakeholders in the charter school accountability system, boards of directors have decision making authority at the school site level. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> role, charter school boards have a unique opportunity to help build capacity for better charter school accountability in Minnesota.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{rather than}} asking for inspiration, the poet demands explanation, though now he presumes his Muse's excuse for the neglect, which the poet {{takes to be}} that truth of beauty is self-evident, and needs no further embellishment. It is {{in the second and}} third line of this quatrain, or the sixth and seventh lines in the sonnet, where the rhythmic structure of Sonnet 101 becomes noteworthy. Whereas the rest of Sonnet 101 follows conventional structural patterns, it is in line 6 and 7, [...] "Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed; / Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay," [...] that the rhythm deviates from the established norm, which is discussed in depth earlier in this article. Though there is no definitive explanation for this alteration, its inconsistency warrants speculation. If we assume that the difference in pattern is not an oversight on the part of Shakespeare, then it is conceivable that this creative idiosyncrasy was made for aesthetic or symbolic reasons. It is then pertinent to question why these particular lines are <b>given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> structural treatment. Putting aside aesthetic interpretation, it could be conceived that Shakespeare intentionally chose these two lines with which to assert freedom from the regular metrics of iambic pentameter, to show that truth and beauty should be singled out. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> interpretation of the second and third lines of the quatrain, the fourth line, [...] "But best is best, if never intermixed?"

40|$|Studies {{over the}} last decade have shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is able to {{preferentially}} locate to sites of tumor growth and modulate (shrink) the growth of many cancers. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> association between S. typhimurium and cancer cells, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the capacity of this microorganism to modulate the plasma membrane multidrug resistance (MDR) protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette transporter responsible for effluxing many cancer drugs. Using an in vitro model of S. typhimurium infection of polarized human cancer intestinal cell lines, we have found that this enteric pathogen functionally downregulates the efflux capabilities of P-gp. Specifically, we show that S. typhimurium infection of human intestinal cancer cells results in the enhanced intracellular accumulation of a number of P-gp substrates that corresponds to the posttranscriptional downregulation of P-gp expression. Furthermore, cells expressing small interfering RNAs against MDR 1, the gene encoding P-gp, were significantly more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of bacterial infection. This result is consistent with our observation that S. typhimurium was significantly less able to invade cells overexpressing MDR 1. Taken together, these results reveal a novel role for P-gp in the maintenance of homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract in regard to bacterial infection. Thus the regulation of P-gp by S. typhimurium has important implications not only for the development of new cancer therapeutics aimed at reversing drug resistance but also in the understanding of how microbes have evolved diverse strategies to interact with their host...|$|R

In response to immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites, CD 8 (+) T cells in BALB/c mice fail to generate large numbers of effector cells without help from CD 4 (+) T cells [...] a defect not observed in most systems. <b>Given</b> <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> early dependence on CD 4 help, we evaluated the effects of CD 4 (+) cells on the development of functional properties of CD 8 (+) T cells and on their ability to abolish infection.

We found that CD 8 (+) T cells induced by sporozoites without CD 4 help formed memory populations severely reduced in magnitude that could not limit parasite development in the liver. The inability of these "helpless" memory T cells to protect is not a result of defects in effector function, as their capacity to produce cytokines and undergo cytotoxic degranulation was indistinguishable from control memory T cells.
