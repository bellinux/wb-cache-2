40|$|Fire is {{a natural}} factor of {{landscape}} evolution in Mediterranean ecosystems. The middle Ebro Valley has extreme aridity, which results in a low plant cover and high soil erodibility, especially on gypseous substrates. The aim {{of this research is}} to analyze the effects of moderate heating on physical and chemical soil properties, mineralogical composition and susceptibility to splash erosion. Topsoil samples (15 cm depth) were taken in the Remolinos mountain slopes (Ebro Valley, NE Spain) from two soil types: Leptic <b>Gypsisol</b> (LP) in a convex slope and Haplic <b>Gypsisol</b> (GY) in a concave slope. To assess the heating effects on the mineralogy we burned the soils at 105 and 205 °C in an oven and to assess the splash effects we used a rainfall simulator under laboratory conditions using undisturbed topsoil subsamples (0 – 5 cm depth of Ah horizon). LP soil has lower soil organic matter (SOM) and soil aggregate stability (SAS) and higher gypsum content than GY soil. Gypsum and dolomite are the main minerals (> 80 %) in the LP soil, while gypsum, dolomite, calcite and quartz have similar proportions in GY soil. Clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) are scarce in both soils. Heating at 105 °C has no effect on soil mineralogy. However, heating to 205 °C transforms gypsum to bassanite, increases significantly the soil salinity (EC) in both soil units (LP and GY) and decreases pH only in GY soil. Despite differences in the content of organic matter and structural stability, both soils show no significant differences (P < 0. 01) in the splash erosion rates. The size of pores is reduced by heating, as derived from variations in soil water retention capacity...|$|E
40|$|Fires largely affect soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC), {{resulting}} both in loss {{of organic matter}} and the genesis of pyromorphic forms that are {{generally considered to be}} highly resistant to degradation. Calcium is known to contribute to SOC stabilisation, so SOC is more protected and fire effects might be less pronounced for soils developed from Ca-bearing materials (e. g., limestone, gypsum) than in other soils. In this work, we investigated the effect of fire on SOC stability in soils developed from calcareous and gypseous bedrocks. Twelve monoliths (15 x 25 x 5 cm) were collected from the top of soils with calcareous mollic (Rendzic Phaeozem, PHrz) or gypseous ochric (Haplic <b>Gypsisol,</b> GYha) horizons in a semiarid pinewood forest in Northeast Spain. In a laboratory designed experiment six blocks were heated from the surface until 250 °C was reached at 1 cm depth, and other six monoliths were preserved as control samples. The O layer and first and second cm from Ah horizon were scrapped {{from the surface of the}} monoliths and analysed separately. Total SOC content was obtained by dry combustion. To assess the content and mean residence time (MRTs) of labile and stable SOC pools, the samples were incubated during 100 days at 25 ºC in a Respicond IV apparatus. Respiration data were acquired continuously and fitted to a double-exponential decay model. The results are analysed in relation to the thermal treatment, soil type and depth using ANOVA for repeated measures. Thermal treatment had contrasting effects on the GYha and PHrz. At the GYha, burning decreased the contents and MRTs of both labile and stable SOC, but the effects were larger on the stable SOC, pointing to a conversion of stable SOC into forms more prone to degradation. For the PHrz, burning decreased the labile SOC contents while increased its MRT, but did not affect the amount of stable SOC, which indeed tended to increase, suggesting the formation of stable SOC due to fire at expenses of the more labile forms.

40|$|Late Quaternary {{alluvial}} sedimentary {{units in}} the Guadiana Menor River valley, {{a tributary of the}} Guadalquivir River in southern Spain are described based on geomorphological mapping, sedimentological analysis, palaeosol development, and radiocarbon chronology. Four infill {{units in the}} valleys were differentiated with surfaces at + 45 (MU 1), + 70 (MU 2), + 8 – 6 (MU 3), and + 10 m (MU 4) above the riverbed. Each unit is capped by a palaeosol. Unit MU 1 (Late Pleistocene: > 43. 5 – 34 cal kyr BP) consists of gravel and sand in channels and bars in braided river systems distally evolving to silty clays in the floodplain with vertic and clayic calcisols. It is capped by dark clays with gleysol development representing wetland environments in endorheic basins. Channelized gravels alternating with sandy silts make up unit MU 2 (34 – 24 cal kyr BP), capped by a <b>gypsisol</b> and interpreted as a semi-arid alluvial fan distally evolving to playa-lake depositional systems. Unit MU 3 (5600 – 2700 cal yr BP), extending along the valley bottom, is represented by gravels and sand distally evolving to a red and white laminated rhythmite of silt and clay deposited in the playa. Unit MU 4 (600 – 700 cal yr BP) is scattered and represented by centimetre-thick gravels and sand sheet layers deposited by sheet flows in semi-arid constrained alluvial fans. Alternating intervals of alluvial aggradation (> 43. 5 – 24 kyr BP, 5700 – 2700 cal yr BP, Late Middle Ages) and fluvial incision (24 – 6 cal kyr BP, 2700 cal yr BP to 1200 AD, 1500 AD to present) are interpreted as valley responses to climate variations and changes in land use. Two regional geomorphological changes are recorded in the sediments: (1) climate-induced aridification after 34 cal kyr BP with an arid climax after 24 cal kyr BP before the incision linked to the last glacial period, and (2) two human-forced aggradation stages (5600 – 2700 cal yr BP and 1200 – 1400 AD) interrupting the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene incisional trend.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the chemical speciation of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cr in four selected soil types {{representative of the}} more abundant agricultural soils in the central Ebro river valley in Aragón. <b>Gypsisols,</b> Calcisols, Solonchaks and Solonetzs represent around 20 % of the total soil surface in the region. A total of 12 selected sites have been sampled and five subsamples were taken in each site to create a composite sample. The four elements have been analysed by the sequential extraction procedure of Tessier et al. [Anal. Chem. 51 (1979) 844. ] by emission atomic spectrometry of solid state (ICP OES). Very little amounts of Fe and Mn were retrieved from the exchangeable phase, the ready available for biogeochemistry cycles in the ecosystems. Therefore, low quantities of Fe and Mn can be taken up by plants in these alkaline soils. Cr was not detected in the bioavailable forms as well as Zn that was only present in negligible amounts in very few samples. The absence of mobile forms of Cr in all soils eliminates the toxic risk both in the trophic chain and from its migration downwards the soil profile. The largest contents of Fe, Zn and Cr were retrieved from the residual phase where metals are strongly bound to minerals, whereas Mn from the carbonate and oxide phases amounts 80 % of its total content. <b>Gypsisols</b> and Calcisols have the lowest metal contents while the highest are found in Solonetzs and Solonchaks. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Within the Ebro valley, the Zaragoza {{province}} {{contains the}} largest area of gypsiferous soils in Spain. Previous mapping of the gypsum outcrops {{has been the}} starting point for this study of the soils developed on them. In this paper, gypsiferous soils are differentiated according to geological age, lithological facies and other depositional features. The most abundant gypsiferous soils correspond to Tertiary outcrops, where a typical catena includes Leptosols on the Crest of the hillslopes, Regosols on the talus and <b>Gypsisols</b> on the valley bottom. Gypsiferous soils, developed on the Triassic Keuper facies and Quaternary materials, occupy a relatively small area. The gypsiferous soils have been mapped at a scale of 1 : 200 000. A CAD software package has been used for digitizing the soil units. A digital elevation model of the Zaragoza province has been created from the digitized topography. The geographical information system, IDRISI, has been used to integrate all the Spatial information generated and to produce maps of the soil types classified according to slope and precipitation. In the Zaragoza province, the gypsiferous soils (Lithic and Eutric Leptosols, Petric, Calcic and Haplic <b>Gypsisols,</b> Gypsic Regosols, Gypsic Solonchaks) occupy a total area of 229619 ha (13 % of the area of the province). 25 % of the gypsiferous soils occur within the semiarid area (annual rainfall < 400 mm) indicating that climate is the main limiting factor for soil conservation, because of the fragility of gypsiferous soils, special care must be taken with land use operations on the 18 137 ha with slopes above 10 °. The knowledge of the distribution of gypsiferous soils in relation to topographic and climatic factors provides an important basis for soil conservation and management. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|No {{studies have}} proven the {{existence}} of soil assemblages typical of arid lands in Europe. This study {{was carried out in}} a representative territory of the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula, Almería province, which is the driest part of Europe, to determine if soils characteristic of arid lands are present. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of soils, the authors made use of mathematical tools previously developed in biodiversity and pedodiversity analysis, such as richness, entropy indices, abundance distribution models, diversity-area relationships and nested subset analysis. The study demonstrates that the soil types or pedotaxa are typical of mountainous arid lands. Shallow and weakly developed soils (e. g. Leptosols, Regosols and Arenosols), Calcisols, <b>Gypsisols</b> and Solonchaks, cover most of the study area, and pedodiversity analysis demonstrates that the pedotaxa spatial patterns follow the same regularities as in other areas, environments and scales.

40|$|Soils on gypsum {{are well}} known in dry climates, but were very little {{described}} in temperate climate, and never in Switzerland. This study aims to describe soils affected by gypsum in temperate climate and to understand their pedogenesis using standard laboratory analyzes performed on ten Swiss soils located on gypsum outcrops. In parallel, phytosociological relevés described the vegetation encountered in gypsiferous grounds. Gypsification process (secondary gypsum enrichment by precipitation) was observed in all soils. It was particularly important in regions where potential evapotranspiration exceed strongly precipitations in summer (central Valais, Chablais under influence of warm wind). Gypsum contents were regularly measured above 20 % in deep horizons, and exceeded locally 70 %, building a white, indurate horizon. However, {{the absence of such}} a gypsic horizon in the top soil hindered the use of gypsosol (according to the Référentiel pédologique, BAIZE & GIRARD 2009), the typical name of soils affected by gypsum, but restricted to dry regions. As all soils had a high content of magnesium carbonates, they were logically classified in the group of DOLOMITOSOLS. However, according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS 2014), five soils can be classified among the <b>Gypsisols,</b> criteria being here less restricting. These soils are characterized by a coarse texture and a particulate brittle structure making a filtering substrate. They allow water to flow easily taking nutrients. They are not retained by clay, which does generally not exceed 1 % of the fine material. The saturation of calcium blocks the breakdown of organic matter. Moreover, these soils are often rejuvenated by erosion caused by the rough relief due to gypsum (landslides, sinkholes, cliffs and slopes). Hence, the vegetation is mainly characterized by calcareous and drought tolerant species, with mostly xerothermophilic beech (Cephalanthero-Fagenion) and pine forests (Erico-Pinion sylvestris) in lowlands, or subalpine heathlands (Ericion) and dry calcareous grasslands (Caricion firmae) in higher elevations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Soil genesis and {{development}} in arid and semi-arid areas are strongly affected by geological formations and geomorphic surfaces. Various morphological, physical, and geochemical soil properties at different geomorphic positions are usually attributed to different soil forming factors including parent material and climate. Due to variations in climate, geological formations (Quaternary, Neogene and Cretaceous) and geomorphology, {{the aim of the}} present research was the study of genesis, development, clay mineralogy, and micromorphology of soils affected by climate, geology and geomorphology in Bardsir area, Kerman Province. Materials and Methods: The study area, 25000 ha, starts from Bardsir and extends to Khanesorkh elevations close to Sirjan city. The climate of the area is warm and semi-arid with mean annual temperature and precipitation of 14. 9 °C and 199 mm, respectively. Soil moisture and temperature regimes of the area are aridic and mesic due to 1 : 2500000 map, provided by Soil and Water Research Institute. Moving to west and southwest, soil moisture regime of the area changes to xeric with increasing elevation. Using topography and geology maps (1 : 100000) together with Google Earth images, geomorphic surfaces and geologic formations of the area were investigated. Mantled pediment (pedons 1, 3, 7, and 8), rock pediment (pedon 2), semi-stable alluvial plain (pedon 6), unstable alluvial plain (pedon 5), piedmont plain (pedons 9 and 11), intermediate surface of alluvial plain and pediment (pedon 4), and old river terrace (pedon 10) are among geomorphic surfaces investigated in the area. Mantled pediment is composed of young Quaternary sediments and Cretaceous marls. Rock pediments are mainly formed by Cretaceous marls. Quaternary formations are dominant in alluvial plains. Alluvial terraces and intermediate surface of alluvial plain and pediment are dominated by Neogene conglomerates. Siltstone, sandstone, and Neogene marls together with Neogene conglomerates are among dominant geological formations of piedmont plain. Eleven pedons affected by young Quaternary sediments, Neogene and Cretaceous marls in aridic, aridic border to xeric, and xeric moisture regimes on above-mentioned geomorphic surfaces were described and sampled using Natural Resources Conservation Service (2012) guideline. Physicochemical properties, clay mineralogy, and micromorphology of soil samples investigated and soils were classified by Soil Taxonomy (2014) and WRB (2015) systems. Results and Discussion: Calcic, gypsic, argillic, and cambic diagnostic horizons investigated after field and laboratory studies. Typic Calcigypsids, Lithic Torriorthents, Typic Haplogypsids, Typic Haplocalcids, Typic Torrifluvents, Sodic Haplocambids, Typic Calciargids, and Xeric Haplocalcids subgroups were found using Soil Taxonomy (2014) system. <b>Gypsisols,</b> Calcisols, Luvisols, Cambisols, and Regosols reference soil groups identified by WRB (2015) classification system.

Soils in aridic moisture regimes were little developed with gypsic horizon, and where calcic horizon was formed, it was near the surface. Moving to the west with increasing humidity, gypsum was leached from the pedon and clay illuviation caused argillic horizon to be formed. Formation of Btk horizon in pedon 9 was attributed to a more paleoclimate. The maximum gypsum content of 44. 7...|$|R
