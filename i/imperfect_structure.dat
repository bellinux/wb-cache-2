6000|$|The Papilionidæ are {{a family}} of diurnal Lepidoptera which have hitherto, by almost {{universal}} consent, held the first rank in the order; and though this position has recently been denied them, I cannot altogether acquiesce in the reasoning by which it has been proposed to degrade them to a lower rank. In Mr. Bates's most excellent paper on the Heliconidæ, (published in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society, vol. xxiii., p. 495) he claims for that family the highest position, chiefly because of the <b>imperfect</b> <b>structure</b> of the fore legs, which is there carried to an extreme degree of abortion, and thus removes them further than any other family from the Hesperidæ and Heterocera, which all have perfect legs. Now {{it is a question}} whether any amount of difference which is exhibited merely in the imperfection or abortion of certain organs, can establish in the group exhibiting it a claim to a high grade of organization, still less can this be allowed when another group along with perfection of structure in the same organs, exhibits modifications peculiar to it, together with the possession of an organ which in the remainder of the order is altogether wanting. This is, however, the position of the Papilionidæ. The perfect insects possess two characters quite peculiar to them. Mr. Edward Doubleday, in his [...] "Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera," [...] says, [...] "The Papilionidæ may be known by the apparently four-branched median nervule and the spur on the anterior tibiæ, characters found in no other family." [...] The four-branched median nervule is a character so constant, so peculiar, and so well marked, as to enable a person to tell, at a glance at the wings only of a butterfly, whether it does or does not belong to this family; and I am not aware that any other group of butterflies, at all comparable to this in extent and modifications of form, possesses a character in its neuration to which the same degree of certainty can be attached. The spur on the anterior tibiæ is also found in some of the Hesperidæ, and is therefore supposed to show a direct affinity between the two groups: but I do not imagine it can counterbalance the differences in neuration and in every other part of their organization. The most characteristic feature of the Papilionidæ, however, and that on which I think insufficient stress has been laid, is undoubtedly the peculiar structure of the larvæ. These all possess an extraordinary organ situated on the neck, the well-known Y-shaped tentacle, which is entirely concealed in a state of repose, but which is capable of being suddenly thrown out by the insect when alarmed. When we consider this singular apparatus, which in some species is nearly half an inch long, the arrangement of muscles for its protrusion and retraction, its perfect concealment during repose, its blood-red colour, and the suddenness with which it can be thrown out, we must, I think, be led to the conclusion that it serves as a protection to the larva, by startling and frightening away some enemy when about to seize it, and is thus one of the causes which has led to the wide extension and maintained the permanence of this now dominant group. Those who believe that such peculiar structures can only have arisen by very minute successive variations, each one advantageous to its possessor, must see, in the possession of such an organ by one group, and its complete absence in every other, a proof of a very ancient origin and of very long-continued modification. And such a positive structural addition to the organization of the family, subserving an important function, seems to me alone sufficient to warrant us in considering the Papilionidæ as the most highly developed portion of the whole order, and thus in retaining it in the position which the size, strength, beauty, and general structure of the perfect insects have been generally thought to deserve.|$|E

The high stress and large deformation zones, corresponding to the plastic hinges in the rigid-plastic model, appear at the impinging position and the supporting ends, and the locations coincide with those in the modal pattern in rigid-plastic response.

40|$|Ideal bladed rotors are {{rotationally}} symmetric, as {{a consequence}} they exhibit couples of degenerate eigenmodes at coinciding frequencies. When even small imperfections are present destroying the periodicity of the structure (disorder or mistuning), each couple of degenerate eigenfrequencies splits into two distinct values (frequency split) and the corresponding modal shapes exhibit vibration amplitude peaks concentrated around few blades (localization phenomenon). In this paper a continuous model describing the in-plane vibrations of a mistuned bladed rotor is derived via the homogenization theory. Imperfections are accounted for as deviations of the mass and/or stiffness of some blades from the design value; a perturbation approach is adopted in order to investigate the frequency split and localization phenomena arising in the <b>imperfect</b> <b>structure.</b> Numerical simulations show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed model, requiring much lower computational effort than classical finite element schemes...|$|E

The CP index is then used in a sectoral analysis of the Mexican economy to estimate which sectors are likely to have been winners and which losers. The results of the analysis showed consistency with the instrumentation of the Mexican economic policy.

In sensitivity analysis of the (initial) postbuckling path it is usually considered as a borderline case between imperfection sensitivity and imperfection insensitivity.

Distinction between two kinds of imperfections is {{made on the basis of}} the behavior of the equilibrium path of the <b>imperfect</b> <b>structure.</b> New definitions of imperfection insensitivity of the postbuckling behavior are provided according to the classification of imperfections. A structure with two degrees of freedom with a zero-stiffness postbuckling path is studied, considering four different imperfections.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} study the size effect on the nominal strength of <b>imperfect</b> sandwich <b>structures</b> for buckling driven delamination, to quantify this size effect, and to determine its intensity. A secondary objective is to assess the size effect on the postpeak energy absorption, important for judging survival under blast or dynamic impact. APPROACH: Buckling driven delamination is difficult to control in experiments. Thus, the present study relies on numerical simulations using geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis as well as the softening foundation model, which is an adaptation of Winkler elastic foundation. Delamination fracture is modeled by a cohesive crack model. Dimensionless variables are used to cover the entire practical range. RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS:A major question in extrapolating small-scale laboratory tests to full-scale sandwich structures is the size effect. Delamination of the skin (or facesheet) is often triggered by wrinkling instability, which has generally been considered to be free of size effect.
