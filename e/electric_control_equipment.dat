50|$|With such {{a number}} of trams in service, {{it should come as}} no {{surprise}} that {{a number of}} detail variations occurred in the fleet, only the main variations are listed here. In 1929, cars 274 and 275 were fitted with additional air brake pipes for use in hauling the horse transport cars between the City and Morphettville Racecourse on the Glenelg line. These airpipes were later removed, most possibly after the suspension of the horse transport service in 1936. As originally built, all the drop centre trams were built with General Electric PC5L2 and later PC5K2 control equipment (except for nos 251 - 261 which had English <b>Electric</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment).</b> However, in 1952-1953, cars 259, 260 and 261 had their English Electric control gear replaced with General Electric control gear. At the same time, 251 - 258 and 264 had English Electric controllers of a different type fitted. The original control gear from 264 ended up in the solitary H1 car, 381.|$|E

25|$|The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10001 was {{a record}} {{breaking}} diesel-electric streamliner train built in late 1934 by Pullman-Standard with a power system developed by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation using a Winton 201A Diesel engine and General <b>Electric</b> generator, <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> and traction motors. It was the UP's second streamliner after the pioneering M-10000, the first equipped with a diesel engine and was a much longer train (six cars) than its three-car predecessor. All cars were articulated—trucks were shared between each car. It was delivered on October 2, 1934, and was used for display, test and record-setting runs {{for the next two}} months before being returned to Pullman-Standard for an increase in its power and capacity, following which it was placed into service as the City of Portland train.|$|R
