40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the ex-post enforcement approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current <b>enforcement</b> timing <b>measures</b> and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be applied to this scenario and analyzed.

30|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the use of the enforcement approach is Almeida and Aterido (2008) which developed a proxy for locally varying enforcement, again based on the Enterprise Surveys. The main enforcement measures used were the numbers of visits by labor or tax inspectors. In their empirical model, they include both their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (visits by inspectors) and in one specification also its interaction with the country-level rigidity of labor regulations. Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{microdata}} from Argentine household surveys {{for the period}} 2005 – 2011 to analyze (i) how changes in the enforcement of labor market regulations affect different indicators of compliance with the labor law among {{men and women and}} (ii) how changes in enforcement generates adjustments of some labor outcomes (different than the compliance level) for men and women separately. I take advantage of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina which allows me to construct an <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (number of inspected firms per hundred formal firms) with variation at the province, productive sector, and time level. The econometric strategy links indicators of compliance with labor regulations and other labor market outcomes such as hourly wages, percentiles of the wage distribution, indicators of the provision of non-mandated benefits, and the structure of occupation by employment categories (wage employment versus self-employment), with the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> and with a rich set of individual socioeconomic and labor characteristics, and economic, institutional, and development characteristics of Argentine provinces.|$|E

30|$|The main {{challenge}} to the estimation of the relationships of interest is that the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> is probably endogenous.

30|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} in the analysis of labor market regulations is of clear importance for both developed and developing countries. I focus the empirical work on Argentina for three reasons. First, the availability of data allows me to construct a measure of enforcement with variation across provinces, sectors, and overtime for the period 2005 – 2011, when there is also microdata at the individual level on a wide set of mandated benefits for wage employees, some non-mandated benefits and hourly wages. With this data, I can test for men and women how the compliance with labor regulations reacts when the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> changes, and how other labor outcomes respond, probably due to firms’ need of adjustment. Second, the fact that the labor rules being enforced are common to all Argentine provinces generates an ideal framework to evaluate the effects of changes in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> on labor outcomes using the province variation of the data. Third, equality of opportunities between men and women has been placed {{at the top of the}} policy agenda in recent years. The elimination of any type of violence against women, including the discrimination at the workplace, has been part of Argentine Congress meetings which is discussing laws in that direction.|$|E

The main findings reveal that when enforcement increases, the compliance with mandated benefits and formal wages increase among men, while informal wages decline. Among women, the compliance level declines jointly with informal wages. These heterogenous impacts are explained by labor regulations that make formal and informal men more substitutable in the production process than formal and informal women.|$|E

40|$|Park {{officials}} at Carara National Park, Costa Rica, face considerable challenges. They believe poaching {{has become a}} significant threat to the park’s biodiversity and that their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> largely due to limited funds, are inadequate. Through family-level interviews in six communities surrounding Carara National Park, this study aims to understand the dynamics of poaching by identifying animals at risk of poaching and identifying communities to target future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> Interviews inquired about interactions with wildlife, perceived populations of wildlife, sale of wildlife, opinions towards hunting, and observed hunting activities. Summary statistics, CART modeling and probit regressions are {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicate hunting is not prevalent {{in terms of the number}} of families that hunt. However, these families can still have significant impacts on wildlife populations with poaching occurring for both subsistence and market-oriented reasons. Two potential community sets are identified as areas to target enforcement. Based on the number of reported families engaging in hunting, enforcement should be targeted in Bijagual and Tárcoles. However, exploring truthfulness through CART and probit regression analysis indicates enforcement should be targeted in El Sur and La Hacienda. Ultimately, future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be determined by Carara officials. Although potential target communities are identified and management practices such as ecotourism and community-based management are potentially viable avenues for reducing poaching, the park faces considerable challenges for enforcement due to its limited financial capabilities...|$|R
