Elad was also suspected of betraying the group to Egyptian authorities, though the charges were never proven. He was eventually sentenced to a jail term of 10 years for trying to sell Israeli documents to the Egyptians in an unrelated matter.

De Vere complained that his servant Thomas Hampton had taken advantage of these writs by taking money from the tenants to his own use, and had also conspired with another of De Vere's servants to pass a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>document</b> under the Great Seal of England. The Lord Mayor, Thomas Skinner, was also involved. In June De Vere wrote to Burghley reminding him that he made an agreement with Elizabeth to relinquish his claim to the Forest of Essex for three reasons, {{one of which was}} the Queen's reluctance to punish Skinner's felony, which had caused De Vere to forfeit Â£20,000 in bonds and statutes.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2017, a {{phishing}} attack impersonating a Google Docs sharing email {{spread on the}} Internet. The attack sent emails pretending to be someone the target knew, requesting to share a document with them. Once the link in the email was pressed, users were directed to a real Google account permissions page where the phishing software, a third-party app named [...] "Google Docs", requested access to the user's Google account. Once granted, the software received access to the user's Gmail messages and address book, and sent new <b>fraudulent</b> <b>document</b> invitations to their contacts. The {{phishing attack}} was described by media outlets as [...] "massive" [...] and [...] "widespread", and The Next Webs Napier Lopez wrote that it's [...] "very easy to fall for". One {{of the reasons the}} attack was so effective was that its email messages passed through spam and security software, and used a real Google address. Within hours, the attack was stopped and fixed by Google, with a spokesperson stating that [...] "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again". On the same day, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks. Media outlets noticed that, while the added protection was announced on the same day as the attack, it [...] "may not have prevented this week's attack, however, as that attack involved a malicious and fake [...] "Google Docs" [...] app that was hosted on Google's own domain". In early May 2017, Ars Technica reported that [...] "at least three security researchers" [...] had raised issues about the threat, one of them in October 2011, and that the attacker or attackers behind the actual incident [...] "may have copied the technique from a proof of concept posted by one security researcher to GitHub in February". Furthermore, the report noted that Google had been repeatedly warned by researchers about the potential threat, with security researcher Greg Carson telling Ars Technica that [...] "I don't think Google fully understood how severely this could be abused, but certainly hackers did".|$|E

This {{envelope}} had been brought up at the trial as evidence that, on a certain day, Caldigate had written to the woman as his wife, and had sent the letter through the post-office. For such sending the postage-stamp was necessary. The postage-stamp had certainly been put on when the envelope was prepared for its intended purpose. But {{if it could be}} proved by the stamp itself that it had not been in existence on the date impressed on the envelope, then the fraud would be quite apparent.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Identity theft involves "stealing" another person's personal identifying information, such as their Social Security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, and using that information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing financial accounts. Another pervasive category {{is the use of}} <b>fraudulent</b> identity <b>documents</b> by aliens to enter the United States illegally to obtain employment and other benefits. The prevalence of identity theft appears to be growing. Moreover, identity theft is not typically a stand-alone crime; rather identity theft is usually a component of one or more white-collar or financial crimes. According to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials, the use of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>documents</b> by aliens is extensive, with INS inspectors intercepting tens of thousands of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>documents</b> at ports of entry {{in each of the last}} few years. These documents were presented by aliens attempting to enter the United States to seek employment or obtain naturalization or permanent residency status. Federal investigations have shown that some aliens use <b>fraudulent</b> <b>documents</b> in connection with more serious illegal activities, such as narcotics trafficking and terrorism. Efforts to combat identity fraud in its many forms likely will command continued attention for policymakers and law enforcement to include investigating and prosecuting perpetrators, as well as focusing on prevention measures to make key identification documents and information less susceptible to being counterfeited or otherwise used fraudulently. ...|$|R

50|$|Possibly as {{a result}} {{to the failure of}} the Waitangi Tribunal to achieve much, many MÄori activists in the early 1980s stopped asking for the Treaty to be honoured and instead argued that it was a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>document.</b> They argued that MÄori had been tricked in 1840, that either they had never agreed to sign away their {{sovereignty}} or that PÄkehÄ breaches of the Treaty had rendered it invalid. Since the Treaty was invalid, it was argued, the New Zealand government had no right to sovereignty over the country.

5000|$|The Easter Rising was {{preceded by}} the revelation of the [...] "Castle Document", a plan by the British {{government}} to arrest {{the leaders of the}} Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army and other radicals.

[...] "Forgery is a strong word," [...] Ryan said, [...] "but that in its final form the document was a forgery no doubt can exist whatever". Modern interpretation from Charles Townshend has judged the document to be genuine, and the opinion attributed to the Archbishop's Palace as circumstantial.

5000|$|Trist was {{appointed}} U.S. consul in Havana, Cuba by President Jackson. Shortly after arriving there in 1833, Trist {{invested in a}} sugar plantation deal that went bad. He {{made no secret of}} his pro-slavery views. According to members of a British commission sent to Cuba to investigate violations of the treaty ending the African slave trade, Trist became corruptly involved in the creation of false documents designed to mask illegal sales of Africans into bondage. For a time Trist also served as the consul in Cuba for Portugal, another country whose nationals were active in the illegal slave trade. Meanwhile, Trist became very unpopular with New England ship captains who believed he was more interested in maintaining good relations with Cuban officials than in defending their interests. Captains and merchants pressed members of Congress for Trist's removal. In late 1838 or early 1839, the British commissioner Dr. Richard Robert Madden wrote U.S. abolitionists about Trist's misuse of his post to promote slaving and earn fees from the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>document</b> schemes. A pamphlet detailing Madden's charges was published shortly before the beginning of the sensational Amistad affair, when Africans just sold into slavery in Cuba managed to seize control of the schooner in which they were being transported from Havana to provincial plantations. Madden traveled to the United States where he gave expert testimony in the trial of the Amistad Africans, explaining how false documents were used to make it appear that Africans were Cuban-born slaves. This exposure of the activities of the U.S. consul general, coupled with the angry complaints of ship captains, caused a Congressional investigation and eventual recall of Trist. (Neither Trist nor Madden is depicted in the film Amistad directed by Steven Spielberg, although there are brief Cuba scenes that suggest how the illegal slave trade was carried on there.) ...|$|E
