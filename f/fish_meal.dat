5|$|Currently the harbour {{is being}} {{enlarged}} {{in order to}} accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and fish oil.|$|E

Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning).

Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>meals,</b> {{added to}} feeds {{as a source}} of protein, may contain {{pathogenic}} bacteria. Therefore, effective methods for their sanitizing, such as UV-C radiation, are needed to minimize the epidemiological risk. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of UV-C radiation on the sanitary state of <b>fish</b> <b>meals.</b> The research materials included salmon and cod meals. Samples of the <b>fish</b> <b>meals</b> were inoculated with suspensions of Salmonella, E. coli, enterococci, and C. sporogenes spores and exposed to the following surface UV-C fluencies: 0 – 400 [*]J·m− 2 for bacteria and 0 – 5000 [*]J·m− 2 for spores. For the vegetative forms, the highest theoretical lethal UV-C dose, ranging from 670. 99 to 688. 36 [*]J·m− 2 depending on the meal type, was determined for Salmonella. The lowest UV-C fluency of 363. 34 – 363. 95 [*]J·m− 2 was needed for the inactivation of Enterococcus spp. Spores were considerably more resistant, and the UV-C doses necessary for inactivation were 159571. 1 [*]J·m− 2 in salmon meal and 66836. 9 [*]J·m− 2 in cod meal. The application of UV-C radiation for the sanitization of <b>fish</b> <b>meals</b> proved to be a relatively effective method for vegetative forms of bacteria but was practically ineffective for spores...|$|R

5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
25|$|With {{the amount}} of {{worldwide}} <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> production being almost a constant amount for the last 30+ years and at maximum sustainable yield (MSY), much of the <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> market has shifted from chicken and pig feed to fish and shrimp feeds as aquaculture has grown in this time period.|$|E
25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the carbohydrate content of barley, making it a high-protein fish feed suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> are known, and diets containing zero <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon fish farm in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make the chickens taste like fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E

25|$|When {{pesticides}} {{are incorporated}} into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs.

Also, many animal feeds have a high <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> or fish hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks (1) to determine the optimum level of chloride necessary for the bioassay of protein quality of <b>fish</b> <b>meals</b> as the sole source of dietary protein, (2) to study the interrelation of high levels of sodium and potassium {{with the level of}} chloride and sulfate, and (3) to determine the effect of these ionic changes on the pH of the contents in different portions of the intestines. The results indicate that <b>fish</b> <b>meals</b> when fed as sole source protein to chicks require very low dietary supplements of chloride or none at all to maximize growth. High levels of chloride in dietary mineral mixtures depress chick growth and can be overcome by increasing the sodium level. The growth depression due to high chloride level is aggravated if the sodium content is low and the potassium is high. A balance be-tween dietary sodium and potassium levels must be maintained and also between these cations and the chloride content. No relationship was observed between the growth responses and the pH's of the intestinal contents of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Evidently other factors are involved in the growth depression due to excessive dietary chloride level...|$|R

Objective: We assessed exposure to inorganic mercury in the adult population of New York City (NYC).
