For the inorganic anions, the expected attenuation with detuning was not observed for several bands which are associated with flavin rings II and III.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of Raman spectroscopy {{to the investigation}} of gases has been greatly improved {{by the development of}} the different methods of nonlinear Raman scattering. When two laser beams, one of which has a tunable frequency, are brought to a common focus in a sample, a stimulated Raman process occurs, as soon as the frequency difference between the two lasers is equal to aRaman active rovibrational or rotational transition frequency of the sarnple, and the corresponding state is popuJated above equilibrium. The Raman resonance can be detected in different ways: by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) or the corresponding Stokes process (CSRS), by again in one of the beams (stimulated Raman gain spectroscopy, SRGS) or a loss in the other one (<b>inverse</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> IRS), or even by detection of a photoacoustic signal (photoacoustic Raman spectroscopy,PARS). The selective ionisation of the excited molecules by a third ultraviolet laser pulse (ionisation detected stimulated Raman scattering, IDSRS) has considerably increased the sensitivity in special cases.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{techniques}} of coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and <b>inverse</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (IRS) {{are used to}} examine carbon dioxide aggregation in a supersonic jet expansion. To promote the formation of small clusters, a BMW injector valve is modified to permit its use as a pulsed nozzle at very cold temperatures. This results in a substantial enhancement in the concentration of small aggregates and permits an analysis of relative spectral intensities {{as a function of}} initial temperature, pressure and composition. CARS probing of CO₂ in jets reveals several new peaks in the region of the Fermi doublet, v₁ and 2 v₂, which appear only in the cold, highly condensing conditions of the expansion. This study focuses upon several peaks which are red shifted from the 1285. 5 cm⁻¹, vi monomer peak. The dependence of the relative peak intensities upon initial temperature and CO₂ concentration along with the relative shift from the monomer has enabled assignment of peaks at 1281. 3 cm⁻¹, 1278. 7 cm⁻¹ and 1275. 3 cm⁻¹ to the dimer, trimer and higher polymers respectively. The dimer structure {{has been the subject of}} much controversy and the present results are enlightening in this regard. The CARS dimer peak is shifted - 4. 1 cm⁻¹ from the monomer resonance and comparison with a published infrared spectrum, showing a dimer band with a - 0. 7 cm⁻¹ shift, shows that the dimer adheres to the rule of mutual exclusion and must therefore, have a structure with a center of symmetry. Earlier experimental and theoretical studies gave conflicting evidence for one of two structures, a T-shaped configuration with C 2 v symmetry and an offset parallel structure with C₂h symmetry. Since only the C₂h form has a center of symmetry, it is concluded that the most stable arrangement for the dimer of CO₂ is the nonpolar, offset parallel structure. The Fermi doublet of CO₂ is also used to characterize the performance of a new high resolution IRS spectrometer assembled as part of this thesis work. A pulse amplified, actively stabilized ring dye laser provides the Stokes beam for IRS studies while the probe beam is a chopped single-mode Ar ion laser.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} involves {{change in}} the polarizability of the molecular system on excitation {{and is based on}} scattering process. Spontaneous Raman scattering is a two photon process, in which the input light initiates the excitation, which then leads to an emission of another photon due to scattering. It is extensively used to understand molecular properties. As spontaneous Raman scattering is a weak process, the detection of these weak Raman photons are rather difficult. Alternatively, resonance Raman (RR) scattering is another technique where the excitation wavelength is chosen according to the material under study. The excitation wavelength is chosen to be within the absorption spectrum of the material under study. RR spectroscopy not only provides considerable improvement in the intensity of the Raman signal, but also provides mode specific information i. e. the modes which are Franck-Condon active in that transition can be observed. There are reports on RR studies of many systems using pulsed light as an excitation source. It is necessary to use at least two pulsed laser sources for carrying out the time resolved RR spectroscopy. A single pulse source for excitation would lead to compromise either with temporal or spectral resolution which is due to the uncertainty principle. If an excitation pulse has pulse width of ~ 100 femtoseconds then the spectral resolution will be ~ 150 cm- 1. It is clear now that for improving the temporal and spectral resolution simultaneously, usage of single pulse for Raman experiments (spontaneous scattering) is not adequate. The usage of multiple laser pulses may provide the way out to improve the resolutions. Nonlinear spectroscopy in a broad view helps in understanding the structural and dynamical properties of the molecular systems in a deeper manner. There are a number of techniques as a part of nonlinear spectroscopy that have emerged in due course to meet different requirements and to overcome some difficulties while understanding the molecular properties. Stimulated Raman (SRS) gain, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and the <b>inverse</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> are a few to mention as third order nonlinear spectroscopic techniques which give the similar kind of information about the molecular systems. Stimulated Raman scattering is a more general process involved in nonlinear Raman processes. SRS involves at least two laser pulses and the difference in their frequencies should match with the vibrational frequency of the molecule. The polarization has to be matched between the Raman pump and the Raman probe pulses. We have developed a new nonlinear Raman technique in our laboratory named as ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy (URLS) using the principles of nonlinear Raman scattering. It involves the Raman pump (~ 1 picosecond (ps) or ~ 15 cm- 1 spectral resolution) and Raman probe as a white light continuum (100 fs) whose frequency components ranges from 400 - 900 nm. The laser system consists of Tsunami which is pumped by a Millennia laser and Spitfire-Pro, a regenerative amplifier which is pumped by an Empower laser. Tsunami provides a 100 fs, 780 nm centered, 80 MHz and ~ 6 nJ energy laser pulses. The Tsunami output is fed into Spitfire to amplify its energy and change the repetition rate to 1 KHz. The pulse length of the input pulse is preserved in amplification. The output of amplifier is split into two equal parts; one part is used to pump the Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) in order to generate wavelengths in the range 480 - 800 nm. The output of the OPA is utilized to generate Raman pump which has to be in ps {{in order to get the}} best spectral resolution. A small portion of the other part of amplifier output is utilized to generate white light source for the Raman probe. The remaining part of the amplifier output is used to pump TOPAS to generate wavelengths in the ultraviolet region. URLS has been applied to many molecular systems which range from non-fluorescent to highly fluorescent. URLS has been demonstrated to be very sensitive and useful while dealing with highly fluorescent systems. URLS is a unique technique due to its high sensitivity and the Raman loss signal intensity is at least 1. 5 - 2 times higher as compared to the Raman gain signal intensities. Cresyl violet perchlorate (CVP) is a highly fluorescent system. URLS has been applied to study CVP even at resonance excitation. Rhodamine B has also been studied using URLS. Spontaneous Raman scattering is very difficult to observe experimentally in such high quantum yield fluorescent systems. The variation in the lineshapes of the Raman bands for different RP excitation wavelengths in URLS spectra shows the mode dependent behavior of the absorption spectrum. The experimental observation of variation in the lineshape has been accounted using theoretical formalism. The thesis is focused on discussing the development of the new nonlinear Raman spectroscopic technique URLS in detail and its applicability to molecular systems for better understanding. A theoretical formalism for accounting the uniqueness of URLS among the other nonlinear Raman techniques is developed and discussed in various pictorial representations i. e. ladder, Feynman and closed loop diagrams. A brief overview of nonlinear spectroscopy and nonlinear Raman spectroscopy is presented for demonstrating the difference between the URLS and the other nonlinear Raman techniques...|$|E

The study compares the efficiency of the various deep <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> techniques for the stand-off detection of explosive precursors hidden in highly fluorescing packaging. The study explains {{for the first time the}} synergistic effects of spatial and temporal resolutions in the deep Raman techniques and their impact on the acquired spectral data. 8 page(s...|$|R
