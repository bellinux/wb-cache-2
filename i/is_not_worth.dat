5|$|After {{being told}} {{by a panel of}} Senators that Fringe Division <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the {{transformation}} device by Peter so Broyles can justify Fringe Division remaining active. In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating an image of the creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie is actually the shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's {{career is}} in jeopardy, after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} and then chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a motion for House's dismissal. Wilson {{is the only}} one to vote against the motion. In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his money <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang {{appears in}} the 2013's second season of the web series , portrayed by Brian Tee. Liu Kang in Legacy is portrayed as an anti-hero and {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Outworld rather than that of Earthrealm in the web series. In this version, he is shown to have left a monastery to live a normal life working at a diner with a fiancée. After watching a pair of thieves kill her in a robbery attempt, he becomes consumed with anger and revenge, and further distances himself from Kung Lao and the ideals that were taught to him. After working as a freelance assassin for a few years, he is approached by Shang Tsung, who convinces him that humanity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> protecting and asks him to join the realm of Outworld in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament, which he agrees to. During the tournament, he easily subdues Johnny Cage and Kurtis Stryker before being confronted by Kung Lao, who is surprised at his old friend's change of allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E

5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
25|$|Although Emanuel opposes legalized euthanasia, he {{believes}} that after age 75 life <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> living, {{and the pursuit of}} longevity, not a worthwhile goal for U.S. health care policy.

25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{points to}} the {{negative}} impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the time or cost.|$|E
25|$|Koichi Shido {{is the son}} of Ichiro Shido, a politician. In the manga, when Koichi's mother dies, {{he becomes}} a teacher at Tokonosu where his father is a director, but his father reveals he has an illegitimate son, and forces him to work in the shady family business. One of the {{dealings}} involves stopping Rei’s father from investigating the Shido family’s funding; Shido arranges for Rei to be held back a year. When Rei threatens to kill Shido with her bayonet, Shido dares her to do it, but she cannot, as he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the trouble. Soichiro orders Shido and his student followers to leave, and he complies, but a high-altitude nuclear explosion causes both the bus and nearby forklift with a concrete barrier to stall and they collide. He recovers consciousness {{in time to see the}} undead horde that advances through the gap in the barrier.|$|E

25|$|During a barn {{dance the}} night before the duel, Anna slips Foy a Mickey. After leaving the dance, Albert and Anna kiss before heading home. Upon {{breaking}} out of jail and murdering the sheriff, Lewis witnesses the kiss and reports it to Clinch. On the day of the duel, Foy arrives late and goes into convulsions from the laxative he had unknowingly drunk. Albert, who has decided that Louise <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> fighting for, once again forfeits the duel. He retires to the saloon, but Clinch arrives and demands to know who kissed his wife. When no one comes forward, Clinch shoots a nearby cowboy (Ryan Reynolds). He reveals that Anna is his wife and threatens to continue killing unless his wife's lover duels him at noon the next day. Clinch later forces Anna to reveal Albert's name and then prepares to have sex with her, but she knocks him unconscious and escapes.|$|E
25|$|After {{finding out}} that Lucifer's gone and that Castiel is back, they find a fatally injured Chuck. As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance {{for the world to}} survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin {{gathering}} ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions and Dean convinces Amara that revenge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> it. Amara and Chuck reconcile and Amara heals Chuck of the damage she did to him. The two then leave the Earth, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him what he wants most for helping her. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.|$|E
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
