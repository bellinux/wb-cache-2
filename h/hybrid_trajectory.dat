They then performed a mid-course maneuver to change to a trans-Lunar trajectory {{that was not a}} free return. This retained the safety characteristics of being on a free return upon launch, and only departed from free return once the systems were checked out and the lunar module was docked with the command module, providing back-up maneuver capabilities. [...] In fact, within hours after the accident, Apollo 13 used the lunar module to maneuver from its planned trajectory to a free-return trajectory. Apollo 13 was the only Apollo mission to actually turn around the Moon in a free-return trajectory (however, two hours after perilune, propulsion was applied to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} combining path relinking {{with a set}} of cooperating trajectory based parallel algorithms to yield a new metaheuristic of enhanced search features. Algorithms based on the exploration of the neighborhood of a single solution, like simulated annealing (SA), have offered accurate results for a large number of real-world problems in the past. Because of their trajectory based nature, some advanced models such as the cooperative one are competitive in academic problems, but still show many limitations in addressing large scale instances. In addition, the field of parallel models for trajectory methods has not deeply been studied yet (at least in comparison with parallel population based models). In this work, we propose a new hybrid algorithm which improves cooperative single solution techniques by using path relinking, allowing both to reduce the global execution time and to improve the efficacy of the method.

A modeling formalism for the representation of hybrid systems is the socalled Net State Model.

40|$|SUBJECT The Polyagent {{is a new}} {{modeling}} construct {{that represents}} each entity in the domain {{by a set of}} agents. A single persistent avatar maintains the system’s overall model of the entity in question, and generates a stream of transient ghosts to explore various issues of interest to the agent.

We have used them extensively to explore alternative futures that the avatar may follow, but they {{can also be used to}} evaluate plan structures, compare the usefulness of alternative organizations of documents for retrieval by different analysts, or in other combinatorially challenging domains. In fact, research at KUL has shown how several distinct populations of ghosts (known as delegate Multi-Agent Systems) may concurrently support different facets of a decision being faced by the same avatar. A common thread behind various applications of polyagents is that the ghosts explore different &quot;ifthen&quot; scenarios that guide the decisions made by their avatar. Each ghost explores a possible trajectory for the avatar, though the avatar may in fact adopt a <b>hybrid</b> <b>trajectory</b> informed by more than one ghost.

40|$|In this work, {{hybrid systems}} with {{regional}} dynamics are considered. These are systems where transitions between different dynamical regimes occur as the continuous {{state of the}} system reaches given switching surfaces. In particular, the {{attention is focused on}} the optimal control problem associated with such systems. More precisely, given a specific cost function, the goal is to determine the optimal path of going from a given starting point to a fixed final state during an a priori specified time horizon. The key characteristic of the approach presented in this thesis is a hierarchical decomposition of the hybrid optimal control problem, yielding to a framework which allows a solution on different levels of control. On the highest level of abstraction, the regional structure of the state space is taken into account and a discrete representation of the connections between the different regions provides global accessibility relations between regions. These are used on a lower level of control to formulate the main theorem of this work, namely, the Hybrid Bellman Equation for multimodal systems, which, in fact, provides a characterization of global optimality, given an upper bound on the number of transitions along a <b>hybrid</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Not surprisingly, the optimal solution is hybrid in nature, in that it depends on not only the continuous control signals, but also on discrete decisions as to what domains the system's continuous state should go through in the first place. The main benefit with the proposed approach {{lies in the fact that}} a hierarchical Dynamic Programming algorithm can be used to representing both a theoretical characterization of the hybrid solution's structural composition and, from a more application-driven point of view, a numerically implementable calculation rule yielding to globally optimal solutions in a regional dynamics framework.

40|$|Topological and/or metric {{structure}} on sets of <b>hybrid</b> <b>trajectories</b> {{is central to}} stability and robustness theory for hybrid systems, and their generalizations to systems over higher-dimensional heterogeneous signal domains. Recent work by Goebel, Teel and co-workers (2004, 2006, 2007), and also by Collins (2005, 2006), utilizes a 2 -dimensional hybrid time structure, and indirectly develops topological {{structure on}} hybrid path spaces by studying the convergence of a sequence of paths {{in terms of the}} set-convergence of the graphs of those paths, considered as subsets of the product of the time structure and the state space. In this paper, we explicitly develop a topology on spaces of hybrid paths (of both finite and infinite length), where the topology derives from a 3 -parameter uniformity giving quantitative measures of closeness. Based on a quite general notion of a time structure as a partially-ordered abelian group equipped with a norm function (which includes 2 -dimensional hybrid time), we prove that the path operations of prefix, suffix and fusion all respect the uniformity, and that this uniformity gives topological structure equivalent to that of graph-convergence, which is in turn equivalent to the modified compact-open topology considered by Collins (2005, 2006). The uniform topology is metrizable for many spaces of hybrid paths, but it is coarser than the Skorokhod metric topologies considered by Broucke (1998, 2002) and Kossentini and Caspi (2004) for a restricted class of hybrid paths. ...|$|R
