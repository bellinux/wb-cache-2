In The Jazz Mann Ian Mann wrote [...] "This is music that sounds fresh, spontaneous and adventurous but still with enough structure and compositional awareness to appeal to most discerning listeners". Writing for The Guardian John Fordham observed [...] "Metheny enters completely into the <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit,</b> and gives Vu’s intriguing music a fresh dimension and creative support".|$|E

Krishna Chandra proved equal to the task and enlarged the inheritance of his father’s genius {{in the art of}} Bengali sweetmeats. He also pioneered an <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit</b> in the family confectionery business, enabling it to grow further as a leading Indian confectioner. However it did not start smoothly for Krishna Chandra. Having an immense liking for scientific innovations and machinery Krishna Chandra initially started a mechanical and scientific workshop at Bagbazar. His primary focus was to develop the technology required to scientifically modernize and revamp the Bengali sweet confectionery. Unfortunately his mother Khridmoni Devi vehemently opposed to the idea of redefining Nobin Chandra Das’ confectionery in the light of science and experimentation. This was the prime reason which drove Krishna Chandra (K.C.Das) to break out of his father’s confectionery and create an original development as an extension to the family business under his own title. His vision to imbibe scientific methodology was soon realized and rewarded in terms of economic and technological success. It is probably largely due to the pioneering efforts of K.C. Das that the “Rossogolla” is widely regarded as the national sweet of India.|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen a {{remarkable}} amount of activity and interest {{in the field of}} wavelet theory and multiresolution analysis. With this heightened level of interest, researchers in diverse fields have begun to consider wavelet-based methods. The work presented in this paper was done in an <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit,</b> by investigating the very suggestive similarities between multiresolution analysis and multigrid methods. The results are preliminary and only point to several avenues of future work...|$|E

The trade equation is estimated as an ordered probit model with responses of: 1) a firm has not ever traded or investigated doing any trading activities with Sonora, 2) the firm has not done any trade with Sonora but they have investigated doing business in this cross-border state, and 3) the firm has traded with Sonora, either directly or through a second handler like a broker. A proprietors propensity to visit Sonora as a tourist is modeled from the binary response of whether the individual has ever visited Sonora as a tourist or not. Simultaneity arises since both trade and tourist visits are hypothesized to influence one another. Results indicate that tourist visits have a greater influence on whether firms trade than traditional variables considered like firm age and size. Venture business visits, quantified through the tourism equation, were also {{found to have a}} greater impact on an agribusiness firm's propensity to trade than traditional variables. Our results suggest that communities seeking to develop and expand cross-border trading activities should target entrepreneurs with an <b>exploratory</b> and venture <b>spirit</b> first. Then, target firms that are fairly established (over 15 years in age) and desire to diversity their production risk through multiple geographic production regions. Firm size and foreign language fluency of the agribusiness owner were found to be less significant than tourist visits, venture business visits, and firm age. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

The many facets of IT allow embedding some amusing mathematical problems as a subject of class projects and discussions. Dynamic visualization of such problems and varying their numerical data provide their “on click” simulation. When possible to be implemented, this approach creates inquiry-based learning environment which boosts students’ mathematical thinking, inventiveness, and <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit.</b> Recently mathematics and IT classes have become the major places to set up mathematical literacy and algorithmic culture of Bulgarian students. Modeling witty mathematical problems by dynamic geometry software supports that process both in an effective and attractive way.

40|$|Religions {{are known}} to become rigid and despotic when the icons of {{religion}} are beginning to replace the teachings in order of importance. In a similar manner some formulas and equations of physics have been assuming an icon-like position for the physical sciences. It raises questions whether there are mathematical icons that are now unduly dominating the scene in physics {{with the possibility of}} holding back the <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit.</b> Since the latter has always been physics ' badge of honor, this essay calls on the help of history and philosophy to pinpoint possible onsets of early rigidity wherever they may have occurred. Unfortunately, many physicists have been imbued with ideas that it is exactly philosophy that is in need of such help. The origin of such suspicion goes back millennia. Early philosophers had regrettably misguided their contemporaries about the value of physical experimentation. Ever since the discipline has paid for this attitude of early arroganc...|$|E
40|$|Speculation” {{is often}} evoked {{in these times}} of bank foreclosures, global {{capitalism}} and transnational warfare. On an individual level, it marks a singular moment of pause, daring and subsequent action shared by practitioners of many different disciplines. The roundtable is conceived and organized by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics in collaboration with Vyjayanthi Rao, {{and is one of}} several events held in advance and loosely tied to the publication of a book on the subject. It brings together scholars, artists and designers to explore the moment of speculation and how it shapes our contemporary understanding of community, time, causality, and politics. As a heuristic device, speculative projection is part of most modern forms of thinking and methodology – modeling, scenario planning, stochastic forecasting, prototyping and other forms of research actions that are intimately involved in making our contemporary world by directing the flows of its energies and values. Speculative practice, however, comes to the fore mainly in moments of perceived crises and is frequently associated with moral lapse and excessive affects. Yet, speculative thinking itself remains mysterious, without canonical form in particular schools of thought or specific achievements despite its traditional associations with theory itself. At the roundtable, we will begin to frame this paradoxical visibility/invisibility of speculation by bringing together a consideration of speculative forms of action in various domains – such as economics and art, science and politics, planning and fashion – with the conceptual practices and discursive fields associated with them. Such practices are often elusive and hard to characterize but seem to share an experimental sensibility around altering perceptions and experiences of temporality. Uncertainty and risk as well as calculation, disappointment, hesitation, alchemical transformations and promises of redemption all characterize a speculative sensibility in worlds unmoored from an eschatological or otherwise predictable understanding of the future. Our conversation, as well as subsequent events, is itself conceived in this speculative, <b>exploratory</b> <b>spirit</b> to systematize some intuitions and to gain traction without presupposing a desired, definitional outcome. Filip De Boeck Speculation Opening Statement 1) My intervention will deal with speculation as modes of survival and navigation through the urban scapes of the Global South. In my previous work on Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, I used the image of the mirror as a way to read into the visible and invisible urban realities of this Central-African world (see text reference: chapter 1 of Filip De Boeck & Marie-Françoise Plissart, 2004, Kinshasa. Tales of the Invisible City). The spectral qualities of this city life constantly open up into the spectacular, the marvellous, and the oneiric, but also into the hidden dimensions and undercurrents of terror that constantly run through such city. 2) Starting from this idea of the speculum to capture the urban, I will then turn to the speculative as a strategy to survive within the moment of the city, a way to cope with constant risk, a form of managing the uncertainties of daily life within this urban locale, a methodology also to deal with the suddenness of death. I would like to illustrate this point with a short film fragment from ‘Cemetery State’ (2010), a documentary film which I directed and which deals with life in and around the cemetery of Kintambo, {{one of the oldest and}} most unruly of this megalopolis. 3) The third moment in my intervention will interconnect the strategies of the speculative on the micro-level of individual lives with financial speculation and with death as forms to transfigure Kinshasa, and connect it to the streams of global capitalism. My point of access for this third part is a short video excerpt on a real estate project called ‘Cité du fleuve’. This project consists of two artificial islands that are currently being built in the Congo River, and that will form a new, luxurious mirror city to the current Kinshasa… Ultimately then, my contribution, through a focus on various moments and forms of speculation, will deal with questions concerning the right to the city, the use of public urban space and the content of the notion of citizenship. status: publishe...|$|E
