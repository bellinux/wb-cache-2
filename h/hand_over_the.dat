5|$|After this, Cutzinas {{remained}} as a vassal chieftain, receiving regular pay from the Byzantine authorities. In January 563, however, the new prefect of Africa, John Rogathinus, refused to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> money and had Cutzinas murdered, prompting an uprising from the latter's children.|$|E
5|$|In 651 King Oswine granted 12 named vills, or townships, {{including}} Shotton, {{and perhaps}} Thornington, {{along with a}} large tract of land beside the Bowmont Water, to Saint Cuthbert.

5|$|In mid-1834, the {{imperial}} forces managed to finally repel the Siamese invaders and gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rebels, regaining {{control of the}} southern countryside and besieging the rebel fortress. Although Khôi died during the siege in November 1834, the rebels defending the citadel of Saigon held out against imperial troops until September, 1835. The rebel commanders put to death. In all, between 500 and 2,000 citadel defenders were captured and executed, including Marchand.|$|E

Jew demanded $80,000 for his assistance, but agreed to accept $40,000. The shop owners then contacted the FBI, which supplied the cash for a sting operation. The FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew and <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> money.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer finally {{agrees to}} give up the inhalers, but only to Kate.

Kate elbows Sawyer, and an enraged Sayid attacks him, stabbing him in the arm and hitting an artery. Jack arrives to stop the bleeding and save Sawyer's life.|$|E
5|$|When {{the winter}} of 1136–37 was over, David {{prepared}} again to invade England. The King of the Scots massed an army on the Northumberland's border, to which the English responded by gathering an army at Newcastle. Once more pitched battle was avoided, and instead a truce was agreed until December. When December fell, David demanded that Stephen <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen's refusal led to David's third invasion, this time in January 1138.|$|E

In the meantime, Vijay takes over Lala's empire and stops all the {{crimes committed by}} Lala's gang. He is then contacted by Kancha and offers to go to Mandwa for a business agreement. While in Mandwa, Vijay tries to strike a deal with Kancha to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> drug business in Mumbai over to Kancha and in return taking Mandwa.

5|$|Back at the {{department}} office, reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) interviews Andy for a newspaper article. After he brags about the capture, the reporter suggests his heroics might win him back the affections of Ann (Rashida Jones), his ex-girlfriend, much to Andy's excitement. April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of Fairway Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of Fairway Frank. She refuses to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> captured opossum and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E

5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015 the Australian Federal Court {{refused the}} {{application}} for film makers of Dallas Buyers Club to force ISPs to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{details of their}} customers. The courts found that {{the contents of the}} letter, proposed by the film makers to contact downloaders with, were more demanding than deemed appropriate. The letter was found to ask for such details as salary and other films that were downloaded, as well as punitive damages, which are illegal to seek under Australian law.|$|E
5|$|Kourkouas assailed Edessa {{every year}} from 942 onward and devastated its countryside, {{as he had done}} at Melitene. Finally, its emir agreed to a peace, {{swearing}} not to raise arms against Byzantium and to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Mandylion in exchange for the return of 200 prisoners. The Mandylion was conveyed to Constantinople, where it arrived on August 15, 944, on the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos. A triumphal entry was staged for the venerated relic, which was then deposited in the Theotokos of the Pharos church, the palatine chapel of the Great Palace. As for Kourkouas, he concluded his campaign by sacking Bithra (modern Birecik) and Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmaraş).|$|E

5|$|Leslie and April {{take the}} opossum to Ann's home, where April {{has been paid}} $50 to housesit. April lets the opossum out of its cage, and it causes havoc and minor damage. While hiding from the animal, April reveals her {{feelings}} about Andy to Leslie for the first time. When Leslie refuses to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> opossum, Evelyn angrily takes back her promise of a favor from the mayor's office. Andy, still oblivious to the reasons behind April's jealousy, delivers coffee to April, {{as well as the}} day's newspaper, containing a story which credits April for providing moral support to Andy. It is later revealed that Leslie has donated the opossum to the Pawnee zoo.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E

One month later, Michaels briefly reappeared on Raw Is Wae to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> role of Commissioner to Mick Foley and after another appearance in October he did not make any in-ring appearances until mid-2002, although he appeared briefly on television to make a speech at WWF New York during Armageddon in December 2000.

5|$|Nonetheless, the Japanese were {{gaining the}} upper <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hard-pressed and {{surrounded}} Chinese defenders.

After sunset the fires that blazed out of control on Zijinshan were visible even from Zhonghua Gate in the south which was completely occupied by Japan's 10th Army on the night of December 12 to 13.|$|E
