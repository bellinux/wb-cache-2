Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E

25|$|The {{locations}} where {{the band and}} ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement {{can result in a}} poorly fitting shoe. Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently the ribbons and <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring a new pair of pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for the ribbons and <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.|$|E
30|$|Figures  8 and 9 show {{snapshots}} {{of the assembly}} task using the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> and the o-ring, respectively. It can be verified that the robot successfully inserted both the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> and the o-ring. Here it must be emphasized that although the human demonstration was made using only the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> (which is more flexible than the silicon-made o-ring), the same extracted key points were useful to insert both objects. However, as the o-ring’s stiffness is {{higher than that of}} the <b>elastic</b> <b>band,</b> {{it can be seen that}} the ending position/orientation of the robot slightly differs from that of the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> (Figs.  8 g, 9 g).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Severe {{separation}} of the pubic symphysis is a rare delivery complication. Facing this pathology, we decided to study a new <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device. METHOD: To evaluate the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device, clinical (pain-rated) and imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) evaluations with and without the device were performed. The <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device is a European Conformity-certified medical device, which is made of neoprene straps, that reduces the mobility of the pelvis {{and the use of}} the internal rotator muscles. EXPERIENCE: Once the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was in place, on postpartum day 1, radiography showed a decrease of the pubic width from 41 to 12 mm. Furthermore, pain decreased from 10 of 10 to 2 of 10 in 2 days, allowing the patient to ambulate and avoid surgery. After 1 month, the pubic width (6 mm) and anatomy were recovered but minor pain was still present with hip rotatory movements. The <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was worn 24 hours a day from postpartum days 1 - 90 and 12 hours a day from postpartum days 90 to 150; afterward, the patient returned to normal life without the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device. CONCLUSION: Use of an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was associated with a reduction of the pubic width and pain associated after obstetric pubic symphysis separation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of foot muscle {{strengthening}} exercises with and without <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> to the dynamic balance function in children aged 8 – 12 years with flexible flatfeet. Methods: Forty-one children (aged 8 – 12 years) with flexible flatfeet and dynamic balance problem were randomly allocated into either the intervention or control group. Both groups received thrice weekly training for 6 weeks. The foot strengthening exercise regimens consisted of pronation, supination, short foot, and tiptoeing using <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> for the intervention group and without <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> for the control group. Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) was tested before and after 6 weeks of training. Results: A statistically significant difference of normalized SEBT scores was found for both groups in both legs (p= 0. 00, p< 0. 05). The intervention group was significantly better {{than the control group}} for both right and left legs (p= 0. 00, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Foot muscle strengthening either with or without <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> improves dynamic balance in children aged 8 – 12 years with flexible flatfeet.

25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill.

500|$|Carlisle's 1903 {{season was}} a success, {{with only two}} losses. The 12–11 defeat by Harvard is known for the [...] "hunch-back", or [...] "hidden-ball", play which Warner learned from Heisman; he had a tailor sew <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> into the waists of several players' jerseys before the game so the play could be executed. It was used during a Harvard kickoff; when the ball was caught, Carlisle formed {{a circle around the}} {{returner}} and pushed the ball up the back of the player's (altered) jersey. Carlisle then broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player except the returner (who had the hidden ball) pretended to carry the football. The ruse confused the Harvard players, who scrambled to find the ball carrier, and the returner (ignored, with both hands free) ran untouched into the end zone. Warner's next step was a brief return to Cornell.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy (see Reduced muscle mass, strength and performance in space for more information) and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise such as cycling for example. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia. [...] Other significant effects include fluid redistribution (causing the [...] "moon-face" [...] appearance typical of pictures of astronauts in weightlessness), a slowing of the cardiovascular systemas blood flow decreases {{in response to a}} lack of gravity, a decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main reason}} {{of this paper}} was to prepare the system, which tests the use of <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> for {{smoothing}} the collision-free trajectory. The aided robot off-line programming system is based on NURBS and B-Spline curves. Because {{there is a lot of}} information in references about using <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> algorithm, authors decided to compare these two methods. The most important criterion in robotics is having the smoothest possible robot trajectory, so as a standard there the NURBS curves (C 2 smooth class) were used. Design/methodology/approach: Pascal language compiler was used for research. All algorithms were coded in this programming language and compiled. Results were set in Microsoft Excel worksheet. Findings: Results show that calculations, which were made with B-Spline method, have taken less time than calculations based on <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> curves. Moreover, the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> method gave the smoothest curves but only in geometrical sense, which is less important (the first and second derivate are not continuous, which is the most important issue in presented case). That is why it was found that using the B-Spline algorithm is a better solution, because it takes less time and gives better quality results. Research limitations/implications: The MS Windows application was created, which generates smooth curves (in geometrical sense) by marking the interpolation base points which are calculated by the collision-free movement planner. This application generates curves by using both presented methods - B-Spline and <b>elastic</b> <b>band.</b> Both of these curves were compared in regard of standard deviation and variance of B-Spline and <b>elastic</b> <b>band.</b> Practical implications: Because the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> algorithm takes a lot of time (three times longer than B-Spline) it is not used in the final application. The authors used B-Spline method to make smoother and optimized trajectory in application for off-line collision-free robot programming. Originality/value: This is a new approach, which describes the comparison between <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> and B-Spline polynomials methods in collision-free robot trajectory...|$|R
