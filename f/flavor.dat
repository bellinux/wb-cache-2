50|$|<b>Flavors</b> (and its {{successor}} New <b>Flavors)</b> was {{the object}} {{system on the}} MIT Lisp Machine. Large parts of the Lisp Machine operating systems and many applications for it use <b>Flavors</b> or New <b>Flavors.</b> <b>Flavors</b> introduced multiple inheritance and mixins, amongst other features. <b>Flavors</b> is mostly obsolete, though implementations for Common Lisp do exist. <b>Flavors</b> was using the message passing paradigm. New <b>Flavors</b> introduced generic functions.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flavors,</b> {{one of the}} {{earliest}} object-oriented extensions to Lisp, was a message-passing object system patterned after Smalltalk, but with multiple inheritance {{and a number of other}} enhancements. The Symbolics operating system made heavy use of <b>Flavors</b> objects. The experience gained with <b>Flavors</b> led to the design of New <b>Flavors,</b> a short-lived successor based on generic functions rather than message passing. Many of the concepts in New <b>Flavors</b> formed the basis of the CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) standard.|$|R
50|$|Gelatin desserts are {{classified}} into 5 categories {{according to the}} different <b>flavoring</b> substances they contain.

The last type (“others”) summarizes gelatin desserts not mentioned above. It is typically sold in single-serving plastic cups or plastic food bags.|$|R

50|$|The {{compounds}} used {{to produce}} artificial <b>flavors</b> are almost identical to those that occur naturally.

Natural <b>flavors,</b> in contrast, may contain impurities from their sources, while artificial <b>flavors</b> are typically more pure and are required to undergo more testing before being sold for consumption.|$|R
