2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{identified}} the difficult aspect of Rosenberger v. University of Virginiait {{lies at the}} [...] "intersection {{of the principle of}} government neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities". She identified four considerations showing no Establishment Clause violation arising from the UVA's potential endorsement of the religious message Wide Awake magazine might communicate. [...] First, Wide Awake is [...] "strictly independent" [...] of the UVA. Second, the student activities <b>funds</b> <b>disbursed</b> to it may only be used for permitted third-party reimbursements. Third, [...] "assistance is provided to the religious publication in a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement of the religious message", because it also funds a [...] "wide array of nonreligious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints" [...] via the student activities fund. Fourth, students contribute the money, and students are directly involved in disbursing it under UVA administrative supervision.|$|E
