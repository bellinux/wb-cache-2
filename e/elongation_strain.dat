50|$|A general {{parameter}} {{that indicates}} the formability and ductility of a material is the fracture strain which {{is determined by}} a uniaxial tensile test (see also fracture toughness). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation {{with respect to a}} reference length. For example, a length of abbr=on 80 mm is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to EN 10002. It {{is important to note that}} deformation is homogeneous up to uniform <b>elongation.</b> <b>Strain</b> subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length. Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material. Typical values of the fracture strain are: 7% for ultra-high-strength material, and over 50% for mild-strength steel.|$|E
30|$|With {{increasing}} tubular diameter, {{the variation}} of average bond length in the nanocoil is less sensitive to <b>elongation</b> <b>strain</b> (see Fig. 3), {{implying that the}} nanocoil can undertake higher strain. On the contrary, the elastic limit of compression for a CNC reduces with increasing tubular diameter. For example, the maximum compressive strain is 35 % for (5, 5) CNC, 25 % for (6, 6) CNC, and 20 % for (7, 7) CNC.

40|$|The phonon and {{electron}} transport in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are investigated {{using the}} nonequilibrium Green's function approach. In zigzag SWCNT (n, 0) with mod(n, 3) = 0, the thermal conductance is mainly {{attributed to the}} phonon transport, while the electron only has few percentage contribution. The maximum value of the figure of merit (ZT) is about 0. 2 {{in this type of}} SWCNT. The ZT is considerably larger in narrower SWCNT because of enhanced Seebeck coefficient. ZT is smaller in the armchair SWCNT, where Seebeck coefficient is small due to zero band gap. It is found that the cluster isotopic doping can reduce the phonon thermal conductance obviously and enhance the value of ZT. The uniaxial elongation and compress strain depresses phonons in whole frequency region, leading to the reduction of the phonon thermal conductance in whole temperature range. Interestingly, the <b>elongation</b> <b>strain</b> can affect the phonon transport more seriously than the compress strain, because the high frequency G mode is completely filtered out under <b>elongation</b> <b>strain</b> ϵ > 0. 05. The strain also has important effect on the subband edges of the electron band structure by smoothing the steps in the electron transmission function. The ZT is decreased by strain as the reduction in the electronic conductance overcomes the reduction in the thermal conductance. Comment: 30 pages, 15 figs, accepted by J. Appli. Phy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{simulate}} {{the behavior of}} thin dielectric elastomer structures a finite solid shell element formulation is presented. Dielectric elastomers belong {{to the group of}} electroactive polymers and their use as actuators is caused by the efficient coupling between electrical energy input and mechanical energy output. Also the large <b>elongation</b> <b>strain</b> of 120 - 380 % of the dielectric elastomer actuators and their light weight are advantages that make the material very attractive. Regarding the electro-mechanical coupling a constitutive model is expounded. For the definition of an electric stress tensor and a total stress tensor the electrical body force and couple are considered in the balance of linear momentum and angular momentum, respectively. The governing constitutive equations are derived and incorporated in a solid shell element formulation based on a Hu-Washizu mixed variational principle considering six fields: displacements, electric potential, strains, electric field, mechanical stresses, and dielectric displacements. This formulation allows large deformations and accounts for physical nonlinearities to capture the main characteristics of dielectric elastomers. I...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were {{to find out if}} fiber-based materials could be creped by creasing process and to design creping patterns that affect the material elongation. Special attention was paid to the difference in the ratio of strain-at-break values between machine and cross direction of paper and paperboard. Scientific principles were used to design the creping pattern. Various techniques were used to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of the creped substrates. In order to analyze the creped samples, microscopic analysis was performed to find the cracks in the substrates. Likewise, tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and grease barrier experiments were performed. Thickness and density were reported in the initial phase of the thesis project. Copy paper performed well, because it was thin and rather dense. However, thick and bulky paperboards were trickier since the force the creasing table produced was limited and probably more force would have been needed for more rigid materials such as three-layer paperboard.

40|$|Tagged {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging {{makes it possible}} to image the motion of tissues such as the muscles found in the heart and tongue. The harmonic phase (HARP) method largely automates the process of tracking points within tagged MR images. It works by finding spatial points in successive images that retain the same two harmonic phase values throughout the entire image sequence. Given a set of tracked points, many interesting and useful motion properties such as regional displacement or rotation, <b>elongation,</b> <b>strain,</b> and twist, can be computed. When there is a large motion between successive image frames, HARP tracking can fail, and this results in mistracked points and erroneous motion estimates. In this paper, we present a novel HARP refinement method based on seeded region growing that addresses this problem. Starting from a given seed point which is determined by the user to be correctly tracked throughout the entire sequence, this method can reliably track the motion of the whole tissue. A novel cost function is used in the region growing to assure that points that can be most reliably tracked are tracked first. Experimental results on tagged MR images of the tongue demonstrate very reliable tracking. INDEX TERMS — MR tagging, HARP, motion tracking, region growin...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility to measure the mechanical properties, such as yield strength, tensile strength, <b>elongation,</b> <b>strain</b> hardening exponent and plastic strain ratio parameters, of low carbon steel sheets on the production line using laser ultrasound. The ultrasound generated by the developed apparatus travels mostly {{back and forth in}} the thickness of the steel sheet. By measuring the time delay between two echoes, and the relative amplitude of these two echoes, one can measure ultrasound velocity and attenuation. These are governed by the microstructure: grain size, crystallographic texture, dislocations, etc. Thus, by recording the time behavior of the ultrasonic signal, one can extract microstructural information. These microstructural information together with the modified Hall-Petch equation allow measurement of the mechanical properties.

Construct thickness was measured with digital calipers at three sites and averaged, from which the cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated.

30|$|Water is {{typically}} the major volatile component in magmas and can reach concentrations up to ~ 6 – 7 wt. % in silicic magma chambers (e.g., see Blake 1984; Clemens 1984). When magmas migrate from their source up towards the Earth surface, water exsolution {{can result in}} large (up to several orders of magnitude) increases in magma viscosity because of the strong effect {{of water on the}} viscosity of silicate melts (Leonteva 1940; Saucier 1952; Friedman et al. 1963; Shaw 1963; Dingwell et al. 1996; Richet et al. 1996). Water exsolution is also accompanied by the formation of vapor bubbles that participate in decreasing the bulk density of the magma, reinforcing, in this way, the buoyant force that pushes the magma out of the Earth crust. In silica-poor magmas with viscosities lower than 106  Pa s at eruptive temperature, such as with basalts, gas bubbles can coalesce and escape from the magma (Thomas et al. 1994; Gardner et al. 1996). This situation usually results in gentle (lava flows) to slightly explosive (lava fountain, strombolian explosion) eruptions. In contrast, for silica-rich compositions, the magma viscosity can be considerably higher than 106  Pa s at eruptive temperature, so that bubbles are trapped in the melts (Thomas et al. 1994; Gardner et al. 1996). Exsolution of water from such magmatic liquids often results in foaming. In such case, brittle fragmentation of the magmatic foam can occur, for example, when the <b>elongation</b> <b>strain</b> rate of the foam ascending in the conduit exceeds its viscous relaxation time (Papale 1999). This situation leads to explosive eruptions.|$|E

40|$|To {{compete in}} the current {{economic}} climate steel companies are striving to reduce costs and tighten process windows. It was {{with this in mind}} that a property prediction model for continuous annealed steels produced at Tata Steel’s plants in South Wales was developed. As continuous annealing is one of the final processes that strip steel undergoes before being dispatched to the customer the final properties of the strip are dependent on many factors. These include the annealing conditions, previous thermo-­‐mechanical processing and the steel chemistry. Currently these properties, proof stress, ultimate tensile strength, <b>elongation,</b> <b>strain</b> ratio and strain hardening exponent, are found using a tensile test {{at the tail end of}} the coil. This thesis describes the development of a model to predict the final properties of continuous annealed steel. Actual process data along with mechanical properties derived using tensile testing were used to create the model. A generalised regression network was used as the main predictive mechanism. The non-­‐linear generalised regression approach was shown to exceed the predictive accuracy of multiple regression techniques. The use of a genetic algorithm to reduce the number of inputs was shown to increase the accuracy of the model when compared to those trained with all available inputs and those trained using correlation derived inputs. Further work is shown where the fully trained models were used to predict the relationships that exist between the processing conditions and mechanical properties. This was extended to predict the interaction between two process conditions varying at the same time. Using this approach produced predictions that mirrored known relationships within continuous annealed steels and gives predictions specific to the plant that could be used to optimise the process.

40|$|The {{performance}} of woven fabric in many technical applications, such as airbags or reinforced composites, relates to fabric through-thickness permeability. A unified analytical model for woven fabric through-thickness permeability is proposed. It involves flow through gaps between yarns {{and within the}} yarns in terms of fabric porosity. The yarn permeability {{is a combination of}} flow along and transverse to unidirectional fibres. It is a function of fibre radius, fibre volume fraction, fibre array and crimp angle of interwoven yarns. The gap permeability is developed based on viscous and incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flow in the gaps at low R_e values. The gap is simplified as a smooth fluid channel at the centre with slowly varying circular cross-section. The shape of the channel is approximated by a parabolic function. Volumetric flow rate is formulated as a function of pressure drop and flow channel geometry for the gap. The gap permeability is calculated thereafter according to Darcy’s law. For a woven fabric subjected to a high pressure load, an energy-based model is developed to predict the fabric out-of-plane deformation using minimum energy theory and an isotropic assumption for woven fabric. The model can predict the fabric maximum displacement and corresponding deflected profile across a diameter given a pressure load. The fabric deflection can be used to obtain the fabric <b>elongation</b> (<b>strain)</b> which results in the change of gap size, yarn width, yarn shape and fabric thickness in loose fabric (clear gaps between yarns) and the change of fibre volume fraction and crimp angle in tight fabric (overlapping yarns). The deformed fabric permeability is calculated by the unified permeability model based on the assumptions of the variation of geometric factors with deformation. If a woven fabric is subjected to a high decreasing pressure drop by air discharge, the fabric permeability is obtained by fitting pressure history and corresponding flow velocity using the Forchheimer equation. A nonlinear relationship is found between the pressure and velocity where the corresponding permeability is also called the dynamic permeability. The high pressure causes the shape of flow streamlines to vary in the gap between yarns (viewed as a converging-diverging duct). This flow behaviour is modelled by adding a non-Darcy term to Darcy’s law according to continuity theory and the Bernoulli equation. Therefore, a predictive Forchheimer equation is given for flow behaviour in a woven fabric based on the fabric geometry, structure and flow situation. The developed analytical models were verified by CFD simulations and experiments in this thesis. The comparisons showed good agreements. Sensitivity studies were conducted to understand the effects of geometric factors and mechanical properties on the fabric deformation and permeability. In this thesis, two pieces of equipment in particular were introduced for measuring the fabric dynamic permeability and fabric out-of-plane deformation. The measurements agreed well with their corresponding analytical predictions. Finally, the comparison of fabric deformation and non-Darcy flow showed the importance of fabric deformation in affecting the final fabric permeability...|$|E

A charring and weighting technique {{was used to determine}} the fibre concentration after the compression experiments. Experimental results emphasise the influences of the initial length of samples, the compression <b>elongation</b> and axial <b>strain</b> rate on the fibre-matrix separation phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Compared {{with other}} cereals, wheat is special because the dough that it makes, when mixed {{with water and}} other ingredients, has the {{following}} unique properties: 1. It forms a viscoelastic material. 2. It has good gas retention since the diffusion of gases through the dough is small. 3. It sets when cooked to form a solid foam. In the study of dough rheology, mixing and baking, each of these properties generates the need for different types of mathematical considerations. For the Goodman Fielder problem presented at the 1997 Mathematics-In-Industry Study Group (MISG) meeting at Melbourne University, {{it is the first}} of these three properties which plays the crucial role in any study of the efficiency of the mixing of wheat flour dough. The group studied the mechanics associated with the mixing of a large 300 kg dough mass within a Tweedy mixer rotating at 360 rpm subject to a cycle time of 4 minutes and concluded: 1. The baffles {{along the side of the}} mixing chamber are essential for the <b>elongation</b> <b>strains</b> necessary for dough development. 2. The impeller blades should have a circular rather than rectangular cross section to reduce the stress concentrations in the viscoelastic dough mass that lead to a cutting rather than stretching motion. 3. A series of experimental tests needs to be performed to study the effects of: baffle geometry; mixing speed; and recirculating motions within the mixing chamber...|$|R
40|$|Proteus mirabilis is a dimorphic {{bacterium}} which {{exists in}} liquid cultures as a 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -microns motile swimmer cell possessing 6 to 10 peritrichous flagella. When swimmer cells {{are placed on}} a surface, they differentiate {{by a combination of}} events that ultimately produce a swarmer cell. Unlike the swimmer cell, the polyploid swarmer cell is 60 to 80 microns long and possesses hundreds to thousands of surface-induced flagella. These features, combined with multicellular behavior, allow the swarmer cells to move over a surface in a process called swarming. Transposon Tn 5 was used to produce P. mirabilis mutants defective in wild-type swarming motility. Two general classes of mutants were found to be defective in swarming. The first class was composed of null mutants that were completely devoid of swarming motility. The majority of nonswarming mutations were the result of defects in the synthesis of flagella or in the ability to rotate the flagella. The remaining nonswarming mutants produced flagella but were defective in surface-induced <b>elongation.</b> <b>Strains</b> in the second general class of mutants, which made up more than 65 % of all defects in swarming were motile but were defective in the control and coordination of multicellular swarming. Analysis of consolidation zones produced by such crippled mutants suggested that this pleiotropic phenotype was caused by a defect in the regulation of multicellular behavior. A possible mechanism controlling the cyclic process of differentiation and dediferentiation involved in the swarming behavior of P. mirabilis is discussed...|$|R
