40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{research}} productivity and impact of the finalists of the AIB best dissertation award, now titled the Buckley and Casson Award, but from 1987 to 2012 the Farmer Award. Specifically, this paper examines {{whether there is a}} relationship between winning the best dissertation award and subsequent publication productivity and impact. Relationships between academic institution and institutional geographic location and finalists are also examined. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines 25 years of citation counts and the number of publications in Google Scholar of Farmer Award winners and finalists of the AIB best dissertation award from inception in 1987 to 2009, with cited publications as a measure of productivity and citations as a measure of <b>impact.</b> <b>Top</b> performers in productivity and impact are identified, and the averages of winners and non-winners are analyzed in aggregate, over time and per year. Data on finalists' institution and geographic location of institution are analyzed to describe the importance of location and institution to the award. Findings – It is found that the overall average citations of the winners of the award is less than that of the non-winners, and that in the large majority of years the non-winners have an average citation count higher than that of the winners. However, taking averages in five year increments shows more mixed results, with non-winners performing better in two periods and winners performing better in two periods, with the remaining period being split as to research productivity and impact. Originality/value – Aggarwal et al. in this journal summarized a variety of data on Farmer Award finalists from the 1990 s to gain insights on institutions represented by finalists, the publication record of finalists, and content of dissertations, among other characteristics. This paper updates some of the insights from that paper by examining data on award winners from 1987 to 2013, and adds further insight by examining for the first time cited publications and citation counts winners and non-winners for the same period excluding the last two years...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{sustainability}} and process-related label {{claims have}} gained immense popularity especially for meat products like chicken. Apart from providing consumers with required product information, these labels {{have an impact}} on consumer perception and purchase behavior. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether providing label information affects consumers’ awareness and attitude toward the claims found on chicken products. Additionally, it was analyzed if enhanced label understanding affects consumers’ sensory and quality perceptions along with purchase intent. A total of 110 participants were randomly distributed into 1 of 3 types of education sessions: (1) reading a flyer (passive learning), (2) attending lecture by a professor (passive learning with authoritative effect), and (3) group discussion (active learning). Each participant filled out an awareness survey about 10 label claims commonly shown on chicken products. Participants’ objective label understanding, as well as subjective understanding significantly increased following the educational sessions, regardless of type of education. However, passive learning demonstrated greater potential to induce positive label attitude among participants as opposed to active learning, which actually had a negative <b>impact.</b> <b>Top</b> scorers from this study were chosen as the High Label-Understanding (HLU) group to further compare sensory perception and purchase behavior regarding chicken meat products with respect to their non-educated counterparts, i. e., the control (CNTL) group. High label-understanding was instrumental in participants associating higher quality perception and liking toward labeled samples compared to non-labeled ones. Additionally, this effect varied as a function of type of label claims. It was found that the trust participants vested in the label claims strongly impacted their quality and acceptability ratings. Finally, HLU group looked out for label claims on the chicken products while making purchase decision more than CNTL group. High label-understanding led to an increase in liking and trust toward chicken products with sustainability and process-related label claims. In conclusion, label education positively affects participants’ label understanding and attitude toward label claims, in turn affecting their sensory acceptability and purchase intent. Thus, poultry processors can tap this information to increase acceptability and sales of their respective products...|$|E
