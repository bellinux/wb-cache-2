Smith and Davidson (1986) focus on a latent variable indicating a propensity to violence for males and females. They use three items from the 1981 Monitoring the Future national sample of high school seniors: (1) How {{many times in the}} last 12 months <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> into a fight at school? (2) How many times in the last 12 months <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> into a fight with a group of people against another group? (3) How {{many times in the past}} 12 months have you hurt someone badly? They find that the second item, fighting in groups, is a less reliable indicator for white females compared with males and black females. The reliability of the third item, asking respondents about hurting someone badly, is lower for females than for males. While common factor loadings are found for black males and while males with respect to these items on self-reported violence, Smith and Davidson conclude that these measures do not reflect a single comparable latent variable for females. Weis (1976) reports a similar finding regarding measures of violence. Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis (1981) focus on a comparison of self-reported delinquency formale and female respondents. In their analysis of the Seattle Youth Study, Hindelang et al...|$|E

Since 2004, the way we have chosen to do this is to provide authentic research experiences for teachers using real data (the program used to be called the Spitzer Teacher Program for Teachers and Students, which in 2009 was rechristened the NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program, or NITARP). We partner small groups of teachers with a mentor astronomer, they do research as a team, write up a poster, and present it at an American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting. The teachers incorporate this experience into their classroom, and their experiences color their teaching for years to come, influencing hundreds of students per teacher. This program differs from other similar programs in several important ways. First, each team works on an original, unique project. There are no canned labs here! Second, each team presents their results in posters at the AAS, in science sessions (not outreach sessions). The posters are distributed throughout the meeting, in amongst other researchers’ work; the participants are not “given a free pass” because they are teachers. Finally, the “product” of this project is the scientific result, not any sort of curriculum packet. The teachers adapt their project to their classroom environment, and we change the way they think about science and scientists...|$|E

I’ve really {{been pretty good}} so far about writing. Don’t you think? Right now we’re all sitting around singing 2 ̆ 6 just making noise in general. Girls sure can make plenty of noise. It’s a wee bit hard to consentrate [sic] with {{everyone}} screaming {{at the top of}} their lungs. What have you been doing? Anything exciting? Oh. You take that test on instruments or check-up or whatever it is. Hope that you passed it. Remember the first night we went out when we went to the Post Lodge. You really should have been shot for this, you know. We were dancing 2 ̆ 6 the band was playing something very romantic. The setting was perfect 2 ̆ 6 you were very quiet. Finally I asked you what you were thinking about, remember? At first you wouldn’t tell me 2 ̆ 6 then after I coaxed you for a while you came out with, “How nice an AT- 6 (is that right?) looks when it takes off. ” That almost killed me. It certainly wasn’t encouraging. It struck me very funny afterwards. Judson, please don’t forget to send those pictures—now you have those of me. I won’t be happy until I get them so please don’t forget, huh? Wish that those pictures would hurry 2 ̆ 6 get back from that photographer. Of course, they were only mailed yesterday but I’m dying to see them—The ones I took of you were cute. If they don’t come out well, I’ll murder you (of course I was the one who moved the camera but that’s beside the point). There’s still another roll of film to use up so don’t forget to remind me to take some more pictures of you. There’s only one disadvantage of writing so often. I don’t have anything to say. I just stopped for a minute 2 ̆ 6 said that I couldn’t think of anything to say. You should hear what they want me to write—first suggestion was those three little words. The next those wonderful little words—LSMFT. Then Jackie (the one who’s getting married in November) said to tell you she’s found an apartment. Corinne (she’s already married. Her husband’s the one who’s an [sic] navigator 2 ̆ 6 now is a student officer. He’ll be a pilot soon.) said to tell you Tiki is coming home from the hospital. Tiki is a dog. He used to fly with her husband. Well, hon—it’s time to go home. I’ll try to write tomorrow again. Please write. I miss you already 2 ̆ 6 you’ve only been gone a day.

Honey, I love you so. I wish {{so much that we}} were getting married this Christmas instead of waiting until March. I love you so, honey. When we’re {{together}} time just goes so fast. Can’t understand it. I hope that these next two months hurry. Every week seems so long and every weekend seems like a few hours or seconds. Think that Daddy 2 ̆ 6 I will go shopping tonight. I hope not because it’s awfully cold 2 ̆ 6 slippery out. Have to get some stuff for our Christmas tree. Golly, I love you. Hope that I’ll get a letter from you tomorrow. It’s awful not to hear from you. Oh, I called the doctor last night and changed my appointment for tomorrow instead of today. I’m not looking forward to the visit either. Gee, honey, I love you so. Why do we have to be separated again[?] Every weekend it’s so much harder to leave you. Hope that you’re getting a lot of sleep. Honey could you fly yesterday[?] It was a horrible day here 2 ̆ 6 I suppose it was worse there. It snowed here last night—Quite hard. It [missing word(s) ] {{to go down to the}} city again. That burns me up. What a waste of time 2 ̆ 6 energy. Tomorrow I have to go 2 ̆ 6 buy Daddy’s presents to mother—More fun. It’s so hard to buy things for other people—wish I knew what to buy your mother 2 ̆ 6 Nanny 2 ̆ 6 the kids. Gee, honey, it’s going to be so nice to have you home for Christmas. I love you so. Last night’s snow was 6 inches. No wonder I got all wet when I went out today. You remember—well I can’t. Your sister 2 ̆ 6 mother 2 ̆ 6 I just talked for almost an hour. Honey, do you have a bad temper? We were discussing that. And another thing. Remember, honey, when we were going to be batchelors [sic] together? Well, one of you[r] pet theories was that a husband should be able to go out with an old girlfriend anytime. Just come home 2 ̆ 6 say “honey, I’ve got a date with so 2 ̆ 6 so”—and that would be the end of it. Have your ideas on the subject changed any, hon? I sure hope so. By the way, honey, did I tell you that—I mean did I ask you if we could go 2 ̆ 6 look at wedding rings while you’re home for Christmas? (I’m listening to the radio and if this doesn’t make sense that’s one reason). But, hon, I’d like to get married as soon as you get home—a few hours later—if it’s possible at all—so that we wouldn’t waste any of that time. Would you rather wait a few days or what[?] Please answer that question so that I can sorta know what we’re going to do. Honey, maybe you 2 ̆ 6 Ace will be sent to the same field. Wouldn’t that be nice[?] Honey, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> your orders yet? I sure wish they’d hurry. Well, darling, it’s getting late. Please write soon, honey.

I’m getting better though, broke 19 out of 25 the second time. Thanks for the valentine honey. Did you notice how much alike ours were? Two minds with the same though, that’s good. We even wrote almost the same thing on them, must be fate. Couldn’t write last night I was too tired, this night flying is rough. I fly again tonight, for the last time, I hope. Well at least we had a Sunday that wasn’t rainy. I flew {{instruments}} this morning for two hours, then some low clouds moved in and flying was called, so we came back after and shoot skeet. I heard from Sweetie yesterday. He’s fine, says hello. He doesn’t think he’ll {{be able to make it}} here by two o’clock. I don’t mind much because I think I should have Tom as my best man. Yes it is funny about last Friday night. Sometimes I miss you so doggone much darling. Gosh I wish this time would hurry. I guess I told you I couldn’t get the rings this weekend, no open post. The week always seems so much longer when we don’t get off weekends. Just a minute young lady, I answered your questions about what kind of scotch’s are good. So take it easy and one bottle will be plenty darling. I answered it the day, or day after, I got the letter. Goodnight honey, it takes a few days for mail to get back and forth. I’m glad we’re going to have announcements. I don’t know too many people to send them to. Send one to Sue Burnham for me, and the [?] in New Rochelle and Jean Moseny, Don, and Dud Nash, and my Uncle, don’t forget him, and mom probably wants one to go to Texas. You can find that out from her. And try to find out where Charlie Lange is, I’d like him to have one. I guess you’d better leave mickey out. That’s all I can think of now honey. If I think of any more I’ll tell you. I don’t see any sense in sending to many. Well I’m not first in academics here. There’s a student officer, a 1 st Lt. that’s ahead of me. But I’m ahead on time. I’ve got fifty three hours now. Yes, I doubt if I’ll go to Europe, they don’t use 29 ’s over there. I’m going to the Pacific area all right. When I do go over I’ll probably fly with my crew so I haven’t any idea where I’ll leave from. Anyhow probably wouldn’t be able to be with me. We just get there and take off. But that’s a long way off. I said it won’t be until October, why I try to keep it from you honey? At earliest it will be the last of September, but I doubt it. Well, since you said please, I’ll tell you. Pinch bottle is better. What gave you the idea that there’s anything wrong between me and Sweetie? He’s as busy as I am we write about once a month to each other. I’ve got one his shirts though. Tell Woody to tell him that I’ll send it to him when I can find some string. I’m not going to tell you where we’re going on our honeymoon. I’m not sure yet myself, but I guess I’ll surprise you. We ought to be able to stay ten days maybe, so then you can swim, honey. What a complicated marriage! Is there anything else that could happen to us? I want to get to [?] a few days early so we can get somewhat settled (am I kidding!) You think I’m afraid of a colonel? A measly colonel? Huh! Colonel, Colonel, hmm, couldn’t you just me a major or less. Well, colonel or not, this 2 nd Lt. (or F/O) is giving orders, and don’t try to pull you’re your [sic] rank on me. Hey beautiful, have I told you that I love you yet? You’re tops baby, always stay that way. Don’t let that family of mine kid you about not being able to cook, Bobby couldn’t boil water. You can do that, or can you? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> those pictures back, honey? (answer my questions!!!) Send me a set right away as soon as you get them please. I love you darling. Three weeks from now we will be married about three hours. I know I’ll be shaking like a leaf. (I always do when I get married.) Angel- I miss you more every day we’re apart. I noticed on one of your letters some lipstick in the corner where you must have held it between your teeth. I wish it was on me instead of the letter. I love you darling. Give my best to everyone.

40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES March 17, 1945 Saturday My darling husband, What a day. I’ve met {{more people}} today who I’m sure I’ll never {{recognize}} when I see them again. Went {{out to the}} Post. Met two officers wives on the bus going out. They were both nice and they showed me around the Post. What I saw of it was very nice. Their husbands are both instructors. Gee, I wish you were here. They’ve been here around nine months and know everyone. I felt like an alien not knowing a soul. Gee, I’ll be glad when you get back, honey. If {{this is a little}} gooey it’s because I’m eating some candy + it’s slightly melted. The weather here is still nice. Nice + warm. It feels good though but everyone’s getting spring fever. It still is awfully cloudy but when the sun comes out it’s hot- like June. This candy is all over my face- not to mention hands. Oh, one of the girl’s husbands has a nice blue ford convertible + we rode back to town in it. Then there’s a girl about two houses away + her husband has a blue Plymouth convertible. That’s what I’d like a blue one. Do you think we’ll have enough money to get one, honey? They’re awfully expensive, aren’t they? Oh, I got this paper at the PX. It was all they had. The fellow down the street has been in the army 5 years now. He’s a nice fellow + so is his wife- I mean she’s a nice girl. What have you been doing? Anything exciting? How has the weather been? I wish you’d finish sooner and get back here before the 31 st- that’s pay day. I have more paper now. Have a thirty day pass to the Post. A commissary card, a cigarette card- they have Lucky Strikes. I got a carton. And a bank book. Oh, I forgot to tell you we have a savings account. Was going to start a checking account but I’d be in a mess with one of them. We have $ 80 in the bank now. Don’t think I’ll need any more than $ 20 until you come back. Hope not anyhow. Oh, I decided not to take the room I told you about yesterday. It’s much nicer here + you could probably get a ride to the Post every morning. There are quite a few officers living near us. There may be an apartment for rent next week + that’s down the block a little. They seem to be much nicer than a room, darling. An officer (Lt.) that I met today is going to let me know about a room he may have, too. He has hot + cold running water. That heater thing was too much for me. Anyway, we don’t have to leave here right away. Oh, well, those are all small details. I miss you so much, darling. Especially when I see other girls with their husbands. They all look so happy. Gee, I wish we were together again. Went for a long ride on the bus today. If you get on it when it looks as though it were heading for town you go for a half hour ride but if you go away from town it’s about five minutes. Just took time out, darling to write mother + daddy. Oh, I also came in from the porch and was sitting on my bed when Mrs. M. called me. I jumped up and when I came back found I’d spilled a bottle of ink all over me + the bed. What a mess that was. Took me over an hour to get it out. We {{may be able to get}} an apartment darling. Then I could cook for you. It would be much nicer than a room + we’d be alone. Gee, honey, do you miss me? I miss you so much. Everyday seems awful without you. Julie + Doris (one of her friends) and I are going to the movies tonight. I wish you were here so that we could do something. My first Saturday night as a married woman + so I go out with girls. Fine thing! They day the first year is the hardest. I wish we’d be together to find out. Have I told you that I love you. More than I ever thought anyone could love anyone else- well, I do. Movin’ pictures on our first eve of our wedding anniversary! Fine thing! Who ever would have thought it- alone almost at that. What’s Nanny’s address? I have to write her + thank her for her wedding present. That was from both Nanny + Gardner wasn’t it? Tomorrow morning, our anniversary. Golly- honey, happy anniversary. Can you believe that we’ve been married a week. I can’t. It seems years since we were together last. Well, you should be back two weeks from today. It seems so long. I’d love Selma if you were here. It’s such a nice place. You’d be surprised how big it is. Goes back for miles + miles. There’s a stable back there somewhere or other but from what everyone says the horses are pretty sad. I’m so glad you gave me your pictures, darling. They’re the first thing I see every morning when I wake up. It would be better to see you but they’re nice, too. We may have about ten rooms on our hands before we’re through. Everyone is looking. I’m not especially worried. If we don’t get one the nights are real warm now + there’s mothering like sleeping under the stars. Afraid this is going to be a short letter. Julie should be calling back soon + we’ll be learning. DO you have to wait very long for my letters? Hope that you’re not working too hard- Remember in “ 30 Seconds Over Tokyo” the nice hotel near Eglin? Is it there yet? Well, darling I wish the days would hurry. They won’t but it seems like they should. Gee, darling, I wish you were here. Will they keep you there longer if it rains? What are you doing + how many hours do you have to have of what is the weather like + are you up to schedule? Hope you finish sooner + they send you home before you’re supposed to be. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> any mail for me yet? Oh, did I tell you to write here instead of the hotel. c/o Mrs. J. M. Moseley 107 Lamar Ave. Selma, Ala. Well, honey, I’ll write again tomorrow. I love you so, Judd. You’ll always be the only one I’ve ever loved or ever will.

No one is in yet, honey, so I decided this would be about the best time to write a little to you. Golly, honey, I miss you so. I hope that you can get home this weekend. Everything has gone wrong. First of all {{yesterday}} was not one of my good days. You called and said you might have to fly on Sunday. That alone would have been enough bad news for a whole week but no. Everything else went wrong too. A couple of minor things happened and then another major catastrophe (words, why didn’t I learn to spell). It was about your Christmas present. The thing I wanted to get you, they didn’t have and would have to order. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to get anything else but it will be two or three weeks at least before they can get that. I’m so disappointed. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m very unhappy about the whole thing. Gee, honey, everything sure goes wrong at once. If you don’t get an overnight pass, honey, {{would you like me to}} come up for a while Saturday or Sunday or something? I just couldn’t stand a whole week or two weeks without seeing you. Gee, I miss you so, my darling. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to see you often enough. I fall in love with you all over again twice as much every time I see you though. I never believed that I could love anyone as much as I love you, honey. Gee, honey, the radio said it would be nice today and tomorrow, but they didn’t mention what would happen on Saturday. I’m praying for nice weather. How long did you fly last night? Hope you get in a lot of hours so that you get home this weekend. Golly, honey, I’ve just got to see you soon. I love you so, honey and it’s so lonesome being away from you even for a few hours. When it grows into days 2 ̆ 6 weeks, it’s awful. Will Steve get home this weekend? Woody is very unhappy—too—this weekend. Don’t remember what I was going to say but anyhoo, I’m home now darling. I’m in a much happier state now. Maybe soon I’ll be in the state of matrimony. Ah, yes. Well, my darling, guess what. I got your Christmas present. Two of them—one tonight quite unexpectedly and the other at noon today. It wasn’t quite what I wanted but it’s O. K. at least I hope you’ll like them. (Both of them—the one at night 2 ̆ 6 the noon one). Golly I’m tired and as you can see nothing makes sense that I write. What a conversation I could carry on. There’s a plane over here now 2 ̆ 6 I just turned out my light and looked for it but couldn’t see anything. Gee, I love you so. You’re so marvelous. I got your letter tonight, hon, and it was so very sweet. I wish I were there to keep you warm too. Now you be careful when it’s cold like that because your resistence [sic] is low, or isn’t it and I wouldn’t like you to catch a cold. Especially when I catch them so easily. It’s pretty cold around here but I’m awfully hot (no cracks!!). Have a sweater (nice and baggy) on and the heat is going on every few seconds. Well, honey, what happened. You finally learned to spell Tuesday! Congrats! I’m glad you liked “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. ” I’ll have to go see it. Well, it didn’t rain or anything today honey, but it was plenty cold. I’ll bet you froze there because it was 22 ° here. I wasn’t cold at all though. Must have my love to keep me warm now. The radio said it would be nice tomorrow. What’s going to happen Saturday is what worries me. I sure hope that it’s real nice Saturday 2 ̆ 6 you go on that cross country flight. How many hours <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> in now, honey? I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so, honey, and it would be so awful not to see you. I know I’ll never see enough of you, my darling. I’ll be trying all my life, though. Every time I’m with you I love you so much more. There are so many more things I love about you now than there were at first. You’re so wonderful. Your line certainly is improving with age or is it practice? Anyhoo, I love you, and I love your line too. Honey, what do you want to do this weekend? Should I call the Meadowbrook, honey, or what? I know Steve is coming down Saturday. He has a date with Woody. What’s this about his going back to the field Sunday morning? Gee, I hope you’re going to like your Christmas presents, darling. Your anniversary present isn’t quite ready yet but it will be soon. Does it seem to you that we’ve been officially engaged for almost a month? Gee, next week is Christmas. I just can’t believe it, darling. Well, my darling, I have to get a couple of things done. I’ll write again tomorrow, hon. I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so. Please let me know as soon as possible whether you can get home this weekend or not. If you can’t do you want me to come up? I love you so, honey. Please write whenever you can. I’m praying for good weather, hon. I miss you “awfully much!” You’re the only “thing” (get that) that I ever think about. I always do think about you, honey. I love you so. I’ll love you always, forever and always. All my love,Dottie P. S. here’s a page that I left out of one of the letters I wrote you. It was quite a few days ago. Probably a week or so but here it is anyhoo. I love you, honey. [Written in margin at the top of page]:here’s the one that was under the bed for so long Friday Dearest Judson— It’s really wonderful to have you come home in the middle of the week. I just can’t believe that you’ll be home again tomorrow. That sounds so nice. Today has seemed like Monday all day. I was just as tired as I usually am on Mondays too. Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 I went to the movies last night 2 ̆ 6 saw “Gypsy Wildcat” 2 ̆ 6 Music in Manhattan. ” We both liked them a lot but I guess we’re easily pleased or something. Golly, I miss you so. I’m so glad that I don’t have to wait a whole week to see you again. I just can’t believe that you’re coming home again tomorrow night. I do wish you’d learn to spell Tuesday. You always have the worst time with that day. I haven’t much time to write tonight because I have to leave here at eight. It’s almost seven thirty now 2 ̆ 6 I have to eat yet. Honey, isn’t it wonderful now that your mother’s given her consent. It makes me feel so much better 2 ̆ 6 happier. You have to go on that cross-country flight tomorrow, so please be careful, darling. No more forced landings or anything. Hope that you get home early and that Steve doesn’t have to walk those tours. I do think he 2 ̆ 6 Woody will have a good time together. What do you mean that Ginis too childish? You sound as if you mean a few different things. I’ll ask you tomorrow anyway if I can remember. Oh, our engagement was in the paper. I just found out that the Mt. Vernon paper had it in last night. The Standard put it in tonight. The picture is so dark that you can’t see anything, which is probably the best thing. I’d send it to you but we only have one paper 2 ̆ 6 Daddy will want to see it. Haven’t seen the other one but Woody read it to me over the phone. Gee, I’d love to see a few people in Mt. Vernon when they read that! They spelled Stewart Field wrong, honey, (Stuart Field) oh, well. It doesn’t seems [sic] real still. Seeing it in the paper seems so much more unreal. I just had to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 talk to mother—my grandmother hasn’t an ounce of brains, I’m almost sure. She tells mother how awful the picture looks 2 ̆ 6 how bad my ankle is 2 ̆ 6 gets her all upset. Honestly, there’s going to be a murder around here soon. It’s awfully hard to go up 2 ̆ 6 down stairs without stepping on my foot so she has me go down to talk to mother—women! She’s gotten mother all upset now. Somehow or other I forgot to write on this— If I could draw I’d draw a lovely picture then you wouldn’t know the difference. What have I got to lose— [stick-figure illustration of a person lying on a bed with foot elevated and a dog on the floor.

40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Saturday My Darling husband, Well, honey, {{tomorrow}} will make {{only a week}} more to wait for you. The time sure has gone slowly and next week {{will probably be the}} worst. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> our wedding pictures yet? They should be ready by now. I’m going to try to call the place but haven’t any idea what their name was. Went to see if you got them at the Post yesterday but they said your mail had been sent to Eglin. It’s about time- you should get quite a few letters from me, honey because I’ve written every day except one + one day I mailed Sunday’s letter with Mondays but I hope you get them soon. Have you heard from Steve? Wonder how he is + where he is. You said he made Lt., didn’t you? Don’t suppose he went to see Woody. Honey, there’s a regulation that says unless officer’s are on duty 24 hours a day they can’t be confined to the Post. That would mean that you can live off the post as long as you’re back on the line when you’re supposed to be. A girl that I was out with yesterday who’s [sic] husband has been in three or two years, said her husband was living off the Post + he’s going through his P- 40 transition too. He also said she could go to Eglin with him since they had a car + the only reason the Army said no wives was because of the difficulty in finding someplace to live. If she goes to Eglin, honey, I’ll be so mad. Don’t see why wives shouldn’t. After all, honey, what difference does it make. Phooey on the Army. Yesterday Martha (she’s the one who’s married + has a baby- Her husband says she can go to Eglin) + another wife. Don’t know her name. Her husbands a ground officer – PT instructor – and I went to the Post – showed them where to get their passes + everything + then we met the ground officer at the officer’s club. It’s real nice there. Gee, darling, all they heard every two minutes was how much I missed you. They must have gotten mighty sick of it. Anyway, we had some ice cream. They have real nice ice cream there. And then went home. It helped to make the day go faster anyway. Then Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + I went to the movies. Saw “A Song to Remember”. Gee, it was marvelous. The music in that was wonderful. You’ll have to play Chopin’s stuff sometime, honey. It’s been so long since I heard you play, darling. Much too long. Ever since that night at Woody’s. As soon as you come back, please play for me. Mr. + Mrs. Moseley have a piano. Don’t think they’d appreciate it but I certainly would. They’re the quietest people except early in the morning when I’m trying to sleep. Then it’s just about impossible. But when we have the front room we won’t hear anything, and I don’t think they’ll hear us. Won’t move into the front room until you get back because I’d like to spend the first night there with you. Move the day you come. That won’t be bad from one room to the next but when we have to really move- it’s going to be murder. Can’t send anything express because it never gets there. Has your foot locker come yet. Oh, can you get me one, honey? I’m going to need it. Did I tell you I sent for my radio. Probably won’t get here until we’re ready to leave but it will be nice and inconvenient to carry with us. We can ship it to our next Post probably if we know where it is. Gee, honey, I miss you so. It seems so awfully long since that Wednesday morning when you left. Oh, the latest on the fellows over in the Pacific is they fly at least 100 combat hours + spend a year overseas. Last night couldn’t get to sleep. Don’t know whether I was thinking too much or what but sure did a lot of thinking. Remind me to tell you about it when you get back. Don’t think I’ll need any reminding though. You probably won’t agree with a few things. Still like Selma a lot. It’s a nice little town- not much to do but the people are so nice. Julie has a date tonight- so Bettie Jo + I are going to do something. Bettie Jo is a real sweet girl- like her a lot. She certainly got a dirty deal from a fellow stationed here. Men can be such rats. Really liked her a lot + then after going with her for eight months left Craig. Went to B- 29 school. I think it was, and then wrote but now she hasn’t heard a word for a month. It was a month last night. She doesn’t date many boys. It really isn’t a [sic] nice as it seems for girls who leave near an Army camp. They might have girls back home and that they can’t get serious. It must be awful to go out on dates + know {{no matter how much you}} like a boy, it’s no use. Julie is the type who it wouldn’t make any difference to but Bettie Jo isn’t. How is Tom making it without his glasses? Bettie Jo has been worried about that but we decided they might get broken if we mailed them. You probably won’t get this letter until after you’re back home, honey. It seems funny writing + knowing you probably won’t get it right away. Well, darling, I’ve got to get dressed + go to town. I love you so, honey, and miss you a thousand times more than I ever did before. Well only a week more, honey, and we’ll be together- I love you honey, write more later. Sunday Well, honey, I was a little busy + never did get to finish this letter. Yesterday morning met Alice while I was waiting for the bus + she drove me to town. Then we went shopping and came home. We ate lunch at her house + fooled around the rest of the day. Had dinner there + stayed until around 11 : 30 last night. Was too tired when I got home to write any more. This morning we had breakfast together + then Alice + Cliff went flying. Boy, honey, sure wish you’d get those 750 hours in so you could take me. I’m just dying to go. Then we went to the movies. Saw “Objective Burma”. Golly, it was good. Alice + I aged ten years in that picture. Liked it loads though. They’re both real nice + lots of fun. They are teasing me about getting married all the time. What a beating I take. They battle all day long- been married nine months. Oh, darling, today’s our anniversary. Happy Anniversary darling. Christmas- what a married life. I love you so, honey + miss you awfully. Oh, mother called me today- just about ten minutes ago. It was swell to hear her voice. We talked about ½ hour. We’ll be owning the telephone company if this keeps up. It was so hard to keep her from asking about you. She asked if you were here + I changed the subject real quick. She said to give you three kisses (Maw, Paw + Granmaw) + a long lick (Rex). She wants us to stay there when we go home on leave. We got $ 200 in war bonds from Uncle Guy. Isn’t that wonderful. He wrote a real sweet letter. That was awfully nice of him. Maw’s mailing them + the letter down- It’s great. She’s written me an air mail special + it’s probably on its way to Eglin now. They mailed the radio yesterday- we should get it just about the time we leave. Do you think we’ll be able to get a car? We have about 18. 75 x about 14 - that’s let’s see well over $ 200. You just called, darling, and it was so good to hear your voice, honey. Lord, I love you so. I’m so glad that you’re coming back on Saturday. Honey, don’t ever worry about it when I gripe. I never mean it. It was just kidding in that letter. In fact I think it’s a riot. Don’t ever worry. Everyone gripes once in a while and I just felt like it. It’s thundering now, honey we’ll probably have a real nice storm. Gee, honey, it was so good to hear your voice- I love you so. You have the nicest voice but I’d rather see you when you’re talking. Boy, honey, we’re really going to be in a sad state when you get back. Lord, it’s been a long time. I’m dying to see our wedding pictures, honey- I can imagine how good they are. You always look adorable but I take the world’s worst picture. What you think is good I probably won’t like at all. No one ever likes the ones everyone else does. You said some horrid pictures you saw were good + I didn’t think so at all + then some that you said were horrid I thought were real god. Oh, well, Saturday I’ll be able to see them. Golly, darling, I can hardly wait til Saturday. Gee, it will be wonderful to see you again. Oh, be prepared- I’ve gained a terrific amount of weight since you left. Because I’ve been eating like a little pig. This Southern food sure is fattening. I love you so much, honey. There’s a dance Saturday night at the officer’s club. Will you be home in time for that or won’t you want to go? We should celebrate, definitely but how is up to you. I’m going to go crazy waiting for you Saturday. I’ll be a wreck. Hope you get home early, honey. The suspense will be awful. Oh, no remarks about my not writing- and I was only teasing you when I said I’d been having a good time. I have in a way with Alice + Cliff but golly honey, when you’re away its impossible. Learned how to play Gin Rummy- It’s fun. We should get some cards. Hah- I can just see us playing cards. Gee, honey I’ll sure be glad to see you again. Won’t be long now six more days. I’m so glad that you’re getting home Saturday. Oh, honey, I’m debating about whether to take the front bedroom. The bed squeaks! That reminds me, honey, I want to have a long talk with you. It’s real important + one of the reasons for our trouble. In fact the reason- (Don’t get worried, it’s nothing serious) and it’s the solution. You should have read those books I did. The one about an “Ideal marriage or something like that- Well, I’ll tell you about that when you get home. Oh what a dream I was having last night. Dreamed I was having a baby. Gee, it was queer. Went all through the nice months so plainly- only I had it two months too early + they were mad at me- what a dream. Well, honey, want to get some sleep now. If you ever get worried about my griping again remember I don’t mean it at all- Just forget it + remember anything I went through for you would only make me happy. I love you so, Judd darling and until we can be together again I’ll be the lonesomest gal in this old town. I miss you more than you’ll ever know + love you more than I ever believed it was possible to love anyone. I’m all excited just thinking about your coming home. I’ll be real happy now all week I love you so, my darling. Be a good little boy + hurry home. I love you. You’ll always have my love, always. Your devoted wife- Dottie P. S. Golly, I love you honey- You’re so wonderful + such a perfect husband. Wish you were here now, honey. I love you. [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Hotel Albert Selma, Ala., March 15, 1945 My darling husband, One day {{has gone}} by {{and it was}} a day wasted. Any day that I don’t see you is. Just woke up a few seconds ago, sweetheart. It was awful to sleep along without you, honey. One good thing was that I was so tired hat I went right to sleep + slept until around nine almost without waking up. Gee, darling, {{marriage}} sure {{can make a difference in}} a person’s life. I feel so sorry for all my friends who aren’t’ married. The poor girls- oh, well, they don’t know what they’re missing so that probably is all right. Everyone was so right who told me about you’ll wonder how you ever lived before without it. It seems as though we’d always been married. It really amazes me now more than ever how girls can marry someone they don’t really love. Julie + I were talking about that last night. If I wasn’t madly in love with you it would make me hate you more to even touch me. I just can’t see how they ever could. Marriage is the most wonderful think in the world when you’re in love. And I sure am in love with you. Being away from you is so awful. Part of me just isn’t- (this is the worst pen). Golly, darling, I hope the 31 st hurries and gets here. Golly, what a marriage. We’ve only been married less than a week and you’re miles away. They can’t do that to us. How do you like the field down there. It’s supposed to be awful from what I’ve heard. How do you like air gunnery. I suppose you do a lot. It’s miserable day today. Looks like it’s going to rain any minute. I’m so glad that we had such a beautiful day for you graduation + wedding. I wish that you had married me before you graduated- at Christmas. But I suppose it would have been awful because you never got open Post. It seems so long ago- Christmas I mean. Years and years- and it seems like eight million years since we were together. Gee, honey, I hope you’re at this post a good long time. Don’t get angry. I know you don’t but I like it here. Everyone has been so nice and besides the longer you’re here, the longer we can be together. Last night I slept in the top to your pajamas- slightly large but it was comfortable. Besides you wore them and it made me not so lonesome. I really should get up + get ready to go to Mrs. Moseley’s. I would rather write to you though. How I’ll ever get there with all this extra stuff will be a problem. My suitcases are packed real full and there’s still all the clothes in the closet to go. Oh, honey, I love you so. Being married to you is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. You’re so sweet and understanding and thoughtful and the most wonderful husband in the world. Lord, I’m lucky. Today I’ll be real good + write to mom. I just was too beat last night and too busy all day. I wish that the 31 st would hurry- Golly after we were married I never thought I’d be anxious for the days to hurry. After the 31 st though when we’re together again I hope they go so nice and slowly. Julie’s going to try to get some film for me but it won’t do much good until you fix the camera. She said she knew an officer who wanted to sell a car but can’t remember who it was. Maybe we can buy one. Julie wants me to go out to the Post + get my pass. I’m sorta afraid to go when you’re not here. It wouldn’t see right but I would like to see the bulletin board + try to get a house- I mean a room. Well, darling, I’d better get a bath + start packing- I love you so, honey. I miss you terribly. I love you more than I ever thought possible. Well, darling, here I am at Mrs. Moseley’s. It’s a nice clean place but holy cow if you breathe around here, it sounds like an A 9 - 6 taking off. Everyone is so darned quiet. We’d never be able to stay here. They’d probably throw us out at the first night. Well, I’ll look for a room tomorrow. I have to stay here a week + maybe at the end of that time something will turn up. It’s raining now I think. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Every time I say my husband- it sounds so nice. I wish you were here with me now. It’s thundering and we could be so comfortable here. The bed doesn’t squeak by the way. I hope that I can find someplace to live before this week is up because you’d go crazy here. We’d undoubtedly be requested to leave the way we carry on. Lord, in the middle of the night we get the maddest ideas- remember? Gee, honey, I wish I could tell you how very much I love you. It is so lonesome without you, honey- life just isn’t the same for me. These seventeen days shouldn’t take too long but I know every minute will seem like a thousand years. I love you so, Judd. I’m so happy honey, of course not as happy as I’d be if you were here- but you know what I mean. Everyone at the hotel is trying to find us a room, honey. I sure hope I can find one near to town for when you come back. Julie + Betty Jo + I will probably go to the movies tonight. Julie is so nice to me. She wouldn’t let me be alone at all. Afraid I’ll get lonesome but she’s no consolation. You’re all I need, baby + you’re all I’ll ever need. Without you my life just wouldn’t be anything. I couldn’t live without you, honey. What a difference marriage can make. I never thought I would ever be dependent upon one man for my happiness. It sure changes everything. Golly, I love you. Every minute we’re together makes me love you more + more. My husband- that sure sounds wonderful and you sure are- Golly, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so happy. You’re so wonderful, honey and I’m so proud to be your wife. I hope that one morning soon we’ll be able to lie in bed together + not have to get up a four or five so that I can just sit and look at you. You look so adorable when you’re asleep. I hope that you’re not working too hard + that the weather is nice down there. It would be horrible if it wasn’t and they made you stay down longer- what an awful thought. Do you miss me, honey? Golly, I miss you. Millions more than I ever did before. If these seventeen days don’t hurry I’ll be so lonesome that it will be almost dangerous for you to get back. I wish we could find a handcuff or something so that they could never make us apart. We just shouldn’t be separated darling. It’s funny, darling, ever since I first met you I’ve had that we were meant for each other feeling. As we sure were. Honey, would you mind awfully if something happened- that sounds queer but I mean if I did have a baby. I know that you’d hate to be tied down. If we were going to have one maybe it would be better if I didn’t tell you about it. I wouldn’t want you to worry or be unhappy. You know how I feel about it, honey, in case- But you know how I feel. I love you so, my darling. Being away from you is just like living in a sorta semi-existence. Life won’t be the same until you and I are together again. Then everything will be perfect + I’ll be so happy. Darling, I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you or show you. I’ll be trying to for the rest of our lives but it just can’t be done. Besides, my love for you keeps growing stronger every day. I was sure before we were married- when everyone said you’ll love each other more after you’re married that I couldn’t possible love you any more, but I do and every day I love you more. Honey, I’ll be so happy when we’re together again. Just walking down the street with you will be wonderful and being in your arms again will be heaven. Honey, I wish I could write the way I feel but I just can’t express it. You always say the sweetest things, Judd. I love you so. Golly, it’s pouring! Have to get some more ink- just a sec Oh, honey, I must remember to write to the paper. I can’t do anything- I’m much too much in love. That’s the understatement of the year. Golly, darling, you sure have changed me. How I love it, too. Julie is wrapping Tom’s glasses that he left at her house and we’ll probably mail them tonight + you can give them to Tom. I should go into town now + get some of the things that I’ve forgotten to. I can’t find my tooth brush. You must have it, honey. Do you? I’ll get one tonight anyway. Honey, I hope I’ll be a good wife. I can’t do a thing a wife is supposed to- can’t cook + don’t like to- can’t keep house + have no ambition to- can’t do much of anything but love you. That’s the only thing I like to do, too. I guess I’ll just have to devote all my time + energy to that. What a wonderful job. I have your pictures by my bed darling so that when I wake up every morning that’s the first thing I see. Honey, it sure was fate that brought us together. I’m so lucky darling to have you for my husband. I’ll be thankful for you for always. I can’t imagine what I ever would have done without you. Being your wife, darling, is so heavenly. Lord, I’m lucky- and so much in love. Don’t suppose that you’ll have any time to write will you, honey, but try to because I miss you so much and want to hear from you so. The hotel said they’d keep any mail that came for me. By the way, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> any for me? Gee, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so completely in love with anyone. I was in love with you before we married but it was nothing compared to this. Every minute we’re together is wonderful. I’ll be so glad when we are together again. What a thing for the Army to do. Here we’ve practically just been married and what do they do- separate us. At a time like this, too. I tried to write a letter to mom + my mother but I just can’t. It’s just as thought they were here when we were together. I can‘t write to anyone but you. Told mom that you were going to air gunnery school. It’s awful, Judd. I could write to you all night but a page is the most I can write anyone else. Gee, honey, I’ll sure be glad when you’re back here again. Without you I’m completely lost. Like a fish out of water only worse. Golly, I love you so. I’ll be so happy to be with you again, honey. It’s going to be wonderful. That’s all I can think about- you. My darling, I miss you so. Golly, honey, you can’t imagine how much. Well sweetheart, I guess I’d better start going into Selma before all the stores close. Oh, I can eat now it’s amazing. Please try to write often darling, a letter from you would mean so much. I hope you don’t mind if I sleep in the tops of your pajamas but it makes me feel closer to you + not quite so lonesome. I love you so, darling. I’ll mail this now + will probably write when I get back from the movies. How long does it take for you to get my mail? I love you so honey. I miss you so much, darling. Til we’re together again. My darling, I love you + I’m always Yours, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]: Sunday My darling Judson, Honey, I adore you so. Golly, honey, I {{miss you}} so much. The only thought that I have to cheer me up {{is that at}} the end of the ten weeks we’ll be married. Darling, I have so many things to be {{grateful}} to you for. Your love, sweetness, kindness and understanding has completely changed me. Until this last week, marriage to me was a kind of dark shadow. Something that every woman had to go through 2 ̆ 6 tolerate. Can you imagine how awful that was. You probably can’t. I was so happy being in love with you but always in the back of my mind was that awful fear 2 ̆ 6 doubt. Now that’s all gone. I am so relieved 2 ̆ 6 happy now. Honey, I’m so glad that I’m in love with you. Another thing I’m thankful for is this last week. What a difference a week can make. Without that lord only knows what would have happened. Well, you’re at Spence Field now. I hope it’s a good field and that you’ll like it. What time did you get there? You weren’t late were you, honey? Sure hope not. That hospital was some place. Honestly, honey, those nurses were a bunch of absolute morons. They kept giving me ice bags that leaked 2 ̆ 6 they’d forget that they had leaked 2 ̆ 6 leave me for three quarters of an hour with a wet gown (hah, that’s a laugh—those pityful [sic] things they call gowns—Bags—probably burlap at that). I could just feel myself catching cold. This morning, (I’d just gotten to sleep at about six thirty) at the ungodly hour five o’clock one of the morons came in to wake me up—she took my temperature 2 ̆ 6 pulse. Then the parade began. You’d think I was giving away free lunch or something. Had a glass of milk for breakfast 2 ̆ 6 one for lunch. Also managed some pudding 2 ̆ 6 potatoes for lunch. Darling, I love you so. I can’t think of anything except how very much I love you, honey. You are to me everything I love. While we were at the hospital waiting to go home they played “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Gee, I love you so. That song brings back so many memories. I love you so. All the way home I kept seeing things that reminded me of you. We drove down a few streets in Brooklyn that you 2 ̆ 6 I had when we were lost. Then Daddy turned down a street. Remember how we went down the one way street, the wrong way, where the police car stopped us in New York? Daddy went down the same street the wrong way. Gee, honey, I love you so. Then we drove on that highway that you 2 ̆ 6 I always go to New York on. Gee, honey, so many things remind me of you. Golly, Judd, I’ve really got it bad. Honestly, I never knew I could love anyone the way I love you. Golly—Everytime I see you or just hear your voice I love you more. Golly, Sweetheart, it really will be something when we’re married. We really won’t have a friend left. Tonight’s New Year’s Eve. Gee, it would be marvelous to be with you. In the condition I’m in it wouldn’t be so nice but I do love you so. Wasn’t supposed to come home until tomorrow or later but I hate to stay in a hospital. What a way to spend New Year’s Eve. Wonder what you’re doing now honey? It’s six o’clock. Oh, is your time there different from the time here? I hope not. Cause when I’m trying to imagine what you’re doing at a certain time, you won’t be doing it then. Oh, honey, I love you so. Happy New Year, my darling. What a year this has been. Never dreamed when it started that I’d be engaged before the year was over. Honey, I’d better rest for a while. That doctor told me to rest a lot. Well, darling, I’ll write more later. I love you more than anything else in the world. Whatever you do, honey, remember I love you. Please don’t forget to write whenever you can. I love you so. I always think of you 2 ̆ 6 miss you loads. Monday Hello darling— This is sort of a continued story. What a life. My throat is really sore again today. Can’t even talk. Yesterday your mother 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie came down for a few minutes. Must have talked too much then or something because my throat feels as though there was a lump of something there so that I can’t say a word. In a way it’s nice not to be able to talk. Don’t have to listen to what anyone else is saying 2 ̆ 6 can just sit there and day dream about you—But, golly, I keep thinking of the funniest things I’d like to say. Gee, honey, I miss you so. You are so wonderful to be in love with—I’m so glad that you’re the one I’m going to marry. You’ll be the most wonderful person in the whole world. I love you so, Sweetheart. Oh, remember when Daddy announced our engagement 2 ̆ 6 Ronnie wanted to know if that made him a grandfather now? Well, Mother called Sis 2 ̆ 6 Walter (his mother 2 ̆ 6 father) and said that I was in the hospital. Ronnie must have been listening or something because he asked “Is Dottie in the hospital to have a baby. ” He really is rushing things. Honey, I love you so. It’s really pityful [sic]. No matter what I’m doing I think of you constantly. Happy New Year, darling—I hope that next New Year’s Eve we will be together. Golly, honey, we’ll be married then. Honey, please try to get a lot of rest 2 ̆ 6 sleep during these next ten weeks. Don’t lose any more weight. You’ll have to take care of yourself. Someone has to be healthy in our family. Harry James is playing, “I’m Beginning To See The Light. ” I like it. Just played “Stareyes. ” That’s a good song too. Gee, honey, there are so many things I’d like to say to you. Try to tell you how much I love you and miss you but there aren’t enough words, I guess. Hope that you can read this but I’m lying down 2 ̆ 6 it’s some angle to write from. Honey, I wonder if I’ll ever be sure of you. I can’t explain how I feel 2 ̆ 6 I’ll probably say the wrong thing 2 ̆ 6 give you the wrong impression—But, I just can’t believe that you love me. It’s too good to be true. It just doesn’t seem possible—was thinking about it last night for the longest time and should have written it then when my thoughts were clear. You’re going to be getting terribly conceited but, honey, you’re just perfect—I can’t find one thing that I don’t like about you. Physically you’re perfect. You’re good looking 2 ̆ 6 tall 2 ̆ 6 dark 2 ̆ 6 have beautiful eyes and curley [sic] hair. You’re nice 2 ̆ 6 strong. Mentally you’re perfect, too. You’ve got ability—talent and loads of brains 2 ̆ 6 you’ve got good sense (most of the time, except when you try to be practical at the wrong times). You have knowledge 2 ̆ 6 can use it when the need arises. You can do just about anything you put your mind to. Besides that you have a marvelous sense of humor. You’re sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and I love you. Better stop telling you how wonderful you are or there’ll be no living with you. Golly, hon, this time last week, we were eating dinner here. We didn’t want to go to Brooklyn. Golly, suppose we hadn’t gone. Things might have been so different. I don’t know about you but this week made a lot of difference to me. They’re playing “I’m Making Believe. ” That’s what I’ll be doing until you come home. How is this field? Hope it’s nice. Honey, I don’t see how these ten weeks will go fast but everyone seems convinced that they will. To me they’ll seem more like ten years. When do you start flying? What a day. It’s pouring 2 ̆ 6 the wind is blowing. Glad that you’re not at Stewart now. The weather will probably be awful. The doctor said I couldn’t go out for two weeks. Phooey. It will be horrible lying around for two weeks but good for my ankle. Mother wants me to go see Conover 2 ̆ 6 do photography instead of going back to wholesale. Can’t decide whether to do that or not. Honey, gee, you can’t imagine how lonesome it is around here without you. I’d love to have you home just for a few hours so that I could hear your voice, hear you laugh 2 ̆ 6 say “I love you. ” There are so many little things I love about you. Honey, they’re playing “Together. ” All day they’ve been playing all our songs. Especially “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Memories are wonderful things. We were really lucky to have so much time together, hon. Do you get every weekend off? Are you restricted or anything for the first two or three weeks? How was the train trip down? Do you have any Scotch left or am I kidding? I’ve written you two letters so far 2 ̆ 6 will keep them until I hear from you because they’re so long. I’d hate to have anything happen to them before you read them. Finished reading Mrs. Parkington today. She had a pretty good life. It was a very good story. It took me ages to read it because I kept thinking about you. The nurse was going to make me take my ring 2 ̆ 6 bracelet off but I explained I couldn’t 2 ̆ 6 she was very nice 2 ̆ 6 said it would be o. k. to leave them on. Had me worried for a minute though. Have my tonsils in a jar on my dressing table. They were awful the doctor said. Now I’ll probably be o. k. He said they had so much pus in them that they were breaking 2 ̆ 6 going through my system. Well, from now on I should be the picture of health. Honey, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> in touch with Steve yet? Woody is madly waiting for a letter from him. I have been dying to have a long talk with her ever since you told me what happened to see if she is any different. Now I’ll be looking for her to say something while before I wasn’t. The only trouble is that I can’t talk. It’s awful—wonder if she’ll tell me. I doubt it. I’m sure if I had I wouldn’t go around telling anyone. I’ll tell you if anything happens. She’ll probably have to tell someone. Most people do. Honey, the luggage is so beautiful. I’m crazy about it. Gee, I love it. Honestly, honey, I was so surprised. You can’t imagine. The bracelet surprised me too. I wish that I could have surprised you but I knew you wanted the old pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set. That’s so unromantic, honey. I’m dying to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 sit 2 ̆ 6 look at my Christmas presents. I really haven’t seen most of them. When I first came in they were what I saw. Your luggage. Honestly, honey, I’m crazy about them. Bobbie just called 2 ̆ 6 yesterday she took home the monkey I got for Ricky. She said it looked like you 2 ̆ 6 was calling it Willy—I’ll have to murder her. Bobbie said if I don’t stop writing this letter I’ll have to send it railway express. Grandmaw said I shouldn’t give the monkey to Ricky because it would scare him—I thought he was cute. You can decide whether to be insulted or flattered when you see “Willy. ” Oh, if anyone down there calls you Bill or any other name that comes from William tell them they’ll have a battle on their hands when I get down there. Judson is such a nice name—I’ve always liked that name—ever since I first met you. I really should end this soon because it will be getting too big for an envelope. Honey, I love you so. Every day I was with you made me love you so much more. How long can this go on[?] Every weekend I was sure that I couldn’t love you any more 2 ̆ 6 yet every weekend I did love you more. That last week was wonderful. It was heaven to be with you so much. Almost as though we were married. We certainly weren’t apart for long. It was wonderful. Honey, how do you feel towards Mickey now? You know me well enough to know that I’m not asking out of jealousy. But when you thought you saw her you looked so strange I didn’t quite know how to interpret that look. Golly, I kept thinking today was Sunday 2 ̆ 6 it’s Monday. We were asleep before I guess. Remember? We were out at the base now. Sinatra’s singing “Night and Day. ” It’s so true. I think of you Night 2 ̆ 6 Day. Honey, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. You have such a wonderful way of saying what I mean. Does that make sense to you? But you do. You say what I want to but [can’t] find words for. Now he’s singing “Saturday Night Is the Loniest [sic] Night In the Week. ” Ah, yes. Hope you can read this. I’m just writing whatever comes into my mind 2 ̆ 6 it probably won’t make much sense. I love you. Honey, we won’t ever fall out of love will we, honey? That’s another thing that has worried me. After we’ve been married for a few—(oh, honey, he’s singing “If You Are But a Dream”). (Oh, honey, that’s the first time I’ve heard it since you left. Darling I love you so and miss you terribly. Honey, I hope these ten weeks hurry.) To get back to what I was writing, years to become indifferent to each other 2 ̆ 6 not be in love any more. It won’t happen to us will it, honey? Well, darling—Frankie’s singing “I Dream of You. ” I do—“And I Want You So More than You’ll ever know. ” Hope you like “East Jesus. ” I love you so. Have you started flying yet? What’s it like there? Hope you like it. I love you so. Please write as often as possible. I’ll try to write every day. Probably the rest of my letters won’t be this long, but I’ll try to keep them as long as possible. I love you more than anything else in the world. Goodnight, Sweetheart. I love you. You have all my love forever 2 ̆ 6 always. Dottie P. S. I love you— [Transcription ends...|$|E
