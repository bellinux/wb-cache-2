40|$|We report rapid {{motion of}} {{pulsating}} auroras associated with so called ​ 3 ± 1 Hz modulations {{embedded in the}} main pulsations. During the pulsation ON phase, repetitive expansions are often observed {{around the edges of}} pulsating patches. Some events show a few detached expansions traveling away from the main deformed pulsating patch. Approximately 80 % of all <b>expansion</b> <b>speeds</b> were found to be less than 70 km s− 1 at ionospheric altitudes, which is less than the projected Alfvén speed from the magnetospheric equator to the ionosphere. The rapid motions with speeds of tens of km s− 1 are unlikely to be explained by obliquely propagating chorus elements, which are known to cause the 3 ± 1 Hz modulation, because the perpendicular speed of the oblique chorus waves is higher than the Alfvén speed. We discuss the slow-mode Alfvén wave as a candidate modulation source to generate the rapid motions. A few non-repetitive expansion events with a speed of more than 150 km s− 1 also appear {{at the onset of the}} ON phase. These non-repetitive expanding motions are characterized by a long displacement compared to the repetitive expanding motions. The differences in the <b>expansion</b> <b>speeds</b> indicate different formation mechanisms of the patch motions. 秒単位で発光強度が変化する脈動オーロラには、数Hzの強度変化が伴うことが知られている。高速カメラを用いることで、その数Hzの強度変化に対応したオーロラ形状の高速変化を多数確認することができた。本研究では、その空間変化のスピードは電離圏高度で 70 km s− 1 以下となる例が大半であり、典型的な磁気赤道面でのアルベンスピードよりも遅いという事を明らかにした。より高速な空間変化が期待されるコーラス波動との対応では説明できないため、スローモードのアルベン波が原因である可能性を新たに提唱した。また、電離圏高度で 150 km s− 1 以上の高速変化も発見されたが、単発的で比較的長距離移動する特徴を持っており、数 10 km s− 1 の変化とは異なる形成メカニズムを持つと考えられる...|$|R

The emission distributions appear very similar to those seen in the Crab nebula, with the ejecta located in a thin envelope surrounding the synchrotron nebula. The [O III] emission is more extended than other tracers, forming a faint "skin" around the denser filaments and synchrotron nebula, as also observed in the Crab. The [O III] exhibits somewhat different kinematic structure in long-slit spectra, including a more extended high-velocity emission halo not seen in images. Yet even the fastest <b>expansion</b> <b>speeds</b> in SNR 0540 s halo are slow when compared to most other young supernova remnants, though the Crab nebula has similar slow <b>expansion</b> <b>speeds.</b> We show a striking correspondence between the morphology of the synchrotron nebula observed in an optical continuum filter with that recently resolved in Chandra X-ray images. We argue that the multi-component kinematics and filamentary morphology of the optical emission-line features likely result from magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that form as the synchrotron nebula expands and sweeps up ejecta, as seen in the Crab nebula. Our images and spectra help to refine our understanding of SNR 0540 in several more detailed respects: they confirm the identification of H(alpha) +[N II] in the red spectrum, they show that the systemic velocity of SNR 0540 is not significantly {{different from that of the}} LMC, and they hint at a lower Ne abundance than the Crab (potentially indicating a more massive progenitor star) ...|$|R
50|$|If the universe's <b>expansion</b> <b>speed</b> {{does not}} exceed the escape velocity, then the mutual {{gravitational}} attraction of all its matter will eventually cause it to contract. If entropy continues to increase in the contracting phase (see Ergodic hypothesis), the contraction would appear {{very different from the}} time reversal of the expansion.

Eventually all matter would collapse into black holes, which would then coalesce producing a unified black hole or Big Crunch singularity.|$|E
50|$|The first general {{relativistic}} models {{predicted that}} a universe which was dynamical and contained ordinary gravitational matter would contract rather than expand.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to measure the true speed of Earth-directed CMEs from a coronagraph along the Sun-Earth line because of the occulting disk. However, the <b>expansion</b> <b>speed</b> (the speed with which the CME appears to spread in the sky plane) can be measured by such coronagraph. In order to convert the <b>expansion</b> <b>speed</b> to radial speed (which is important for space weather applications) one can use empirical {{relationship between the two}} that assumes an average width for all CMEs. If we have the width information from quadrature observations, we can confirm the relationship between expansion and radial speeds derived by Gopalswamy et al. (2009, CEAB, 33, 115, 2009). The STEREO spacecraft were in quadrature with SOHO (STEREO-A ahead of Earth by 87 and STEREO-B 94 behind Earth) on 2011 February 15, when a fast Earth-directed CME occurred. The CME was observed as a halo by the Large-Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO. The sky-plane speed was measured by SOHO/LASCO as the <b>expansion</b> <b>speed,</b> while the radial speed was measured by STEREO-A and STEREO-B. In addition, STEREO-A and STEREO-B images measured the width of the CME, which is unknown from Earth view. From the SOHO and STEREO measurements, we confirm the relationship between the <b>expansion</b> <b>speed</b> (Vexp) and radial speed (Vrad) derived previously from geometrical considerations (Gopalswamy et al. 2009) : Vrad = 1 / 2 (1 + cot w) Vexp, where w is the half width of the CME. STEREO-B images of the CME, we found that CME had a full width of 75 degrees, so w = 37. 5 degrees. This gives the relation as Vrad = 1. 15 Vexp. From LASCO observations, we measured Vexp = 897 km/s, so we get the radial speed as 1033 km/s. Direct measurement of radial speed from STEREO gives 945 km/s (STEREO-A) and 1057 km/s (STEREO-B). These numbers are different only by 2. 3 % and 8. 5 % (for STEREO-A and STEREO-B, respectively) from the computed value...|$|E
40|$|Range {{expansions}} {{are central}} to two ecological issues reshaping patterns of global biodiversity: biological invasions and climate change. Traditional theory considers range expansion as {{the outcome of the}} demographic processes of birth, death and dispersal, while ignoring the evolutionary implications of such processes.

Here we use flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) to show experimentally that mean <b>expansion</b> <b>speed</b> and stochastic variation in speed are both increased by rapid evolution of traits at the expansion edge. We find that higher dispersal ability and lower intrinsic growth rates evolve at the expansion edge compared with spatially nonevolving controls. Furthermore, evolution of these traits is variable, leading to enhanced variance in speed among replicate population expansions. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary processes must be considered alongside demographic ones to better understand and predict range expansions...|$|E

40|$|Recently, several events {{described}} as hot expanding diamagnetic cavities {{have been observed}} upstream from the earth's bow shock using the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft.

Here, plasma density, temperature, velocity, and total field changes across the edges of several events were examined, and these changes were found to be consistent with the presence of shocks there. The presence of flat-topped electron distributions and occasional electron beams at and down-stream from the edges provides additional evidence for shocks. Plasma wave observations also show shocklike electrostatic noise at the edges of several events. It is concluded that the edges of diamagnetic cavity events are often shocks, with a range of shock strengths similar to that observed in the interplanetary medium.
