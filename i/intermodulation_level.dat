40|$|A novel {{combination}} of a packaged GaAs MMIC with a microstrip-coupled slot high performance 180 ° hybrid constitutes a downconverter, which provides the very low <b>intermodulation</b> <b>level</b> required by some TV applications. The packaged chip was mounted on a substrate together with a high performance and seldom-used MIC 180 ° hybrid. No adjustable filters are required due to the broadband behavior of the whole downconverter. This feature is required for cost reduction. A double-balanced mixer and the LO balun have been integrated in the same chip. A properly biased cold FET {{was used in the}} mixer to achieve low distortion frequency mixing. An active phase splitter was chosen as the LO balun in order to get small phase errors over a wide frequency band. The MIC 180 ° hybrid, which makes use of microstrip lines, slot lines and coupled-slot lines, was used as the RF balun. The topology used for this hybrid makes it very useful for balanced mixers, since there is no crossing of MIC transmission lines. On the other hand, there are no active elements, so no distortion is added to the downconverter. The hybrid was designed with an intensive use of a quasy-planar electromagnetic simulator. MMIC package modeling is also discussed in the paper. The MMIC was fabricated using the F 20 process of the GEC Marconi foundry. Conversion losses of 8. 5 dB can be obtained for the whole downconverter with a LO drive of 5. 5 dBm. A 3 rd order intercept point of 21 dBm of output power and a spectral purity in the complete RF frequency band of more than 70 dB were achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{intermodulation}} {{performance of}} an FET in the common-source configuration {{is dependent on}} the impedance presented to its gate and drain terminals, not only at fundamental, but also at harmonic and baseband frequencies. At baseband frequencies, these terminating impedances are usually determined by the bias networks, which may have varying impedance over the frequencies involved. This can give rise to asymmetry in two-tone <b>intermodulation</b> <b>levels,</b> and changing <b>intermodulation</b> <b>levels</b> with tone spacing, as previous studies have shown. In this paper, an FET is analyzed to gain an understanding, useful to the circuit designer, of the contributing mechanisms, and to enable the prediction of bias points and the design of networks that can minimize or maximize these effects. Compact formulas are given to facilitate this. An amplifier was tested, showing good agreement between the theoretical and measured results. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that bias networks in microwave amplifiers can lead to complex intermodulation distortion effects. Here, we demonstrate that charge trapping effects in High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) can lead to additional anomalous intermodulation behaviour. This behaviour can be clearly observed as changes in <b>intermodulation</b> <b>levels</b> with tone-spacing, and two-tone asymmetry. Simulations using a simple model, that includes hole trapping effects, predicts similar intermodulation behaviour to measured behaviour.

40|$|Linear and {{nonlinear}} microwave {{properties of}} {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) -grown graphene are characterized by incorporating a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission-line test structure. The intrinsic linear transport properties (S-parameters) of the graphene sample are measured and extracted via a deembedding procedure and then fitted with an equivalent circuit model up to 10 GHz. A statistical uncertainty analysis based on multiple measurements is implemented to esti- mate the error of the extracted graphene linear parameters as well. Nonlinear properties (second- and third-order harmonics {{as a function of}} fundamental input power) of the sample are also measured with a fundamental input signal of 1 GHz. Clear harmonics generated from graphene are observed, while no obvious fundamental power saturation is seen.

It is useful for analyzing the non-linear behavior of switched-capacitor and switched-current circuits at the transistor level. The approach is valid for all input signal levels, makes no assumption of the underlying non-linearity, and its accuracy is limited only by the numerical accuracy of SPICE.

The proposed amplifier configuration consists of a TM sub 030 mode radial line cavity containing 20 IMPATT diodes, with separate input and output ports provided by a ferrite circulator.

40|$|This paper {{reports that}} {{significant}} linearity improvement {{can be obtained}} in gallium nitride (GaN) RF power amplifiers (RFPAs) in comparison to laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) RFPAs {{through the use of}} a modulated drain supply. It is shown that the gain characteristic of a GaN RFPA has significant variation with the drain bias voltage and this results in a 10 - 20 dB reduction in <b>intermodulation</b> (IM) <b>levels.</b> The LDMOS RFPA was measured and the result showed that the gain of LDMOS did not change substantially with drain bias voltage. As a consequence, when the LDMOS RFPA is measured using modulated drain bias, the IM levels showed only a much smaller improvement. These results appear to indicate that GaN devices have an important advantage over LDMOS in linear RFPA applications...|$|R
40|$|A novel linearisation {{technique}} for {{reduction in the}} first and second kind of the third-order intermodulation products was applied in this paper. The second harmonics and second-order intermodulation products are led from the output to the input of a power amplifier through a feedback loop. The power amplifier including the feedback loop components (bandpass filter, phase shifter and attenuator) was designed as a hybrid microwave integrated circuit by using program ADS. The phase and amplitude of the loop signals are the adjustable parameters. Therefore, a voltage that controls a phase shift of the phase shifter and a control current of a PIN diode in the attenuator circuit were optimised to obtain a reduction in the third-order intermodulation distortion. For three fundamental signals at the power amplifier input, the lowest improvement of 13 dB for the first and 18 dB for the second kind of the third order <b>intermodulation</b> product <b>levels</b> was achieved...|$|R
40|$|An HF EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) Digital Transmitter {{simulation}} {{is presented}} in this paper. Effects that increase the IMD (<b>Intermodulation</b> Distortion) <b>levels</b> in an EER system are described and simulated. Basically, the main effects are the limitation of the envelope bandwidth, AMAM distortion and AM-PM distortion at the power amplifier stage, and the delay between the envelope and phase branches. These effects deteriorate the EER Digital Transmitter linearity. By means of this simulation, it is shown the contribution of every effect to the global IMD. The system was tested with a DSB (Double Side Band) signal. As a result, with an envelope bandwidth of 2 kHz and a delay between branches smaller than 5 μs, more than 60 dB of intermodulation product rejection was achieved. It has also been developed an algorithm which determines the delay between branches with an error smaller than 0. 035 o when the signal is a non-modulated tone...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Design {{of modern}} {{powerful}} transistor generators with external exitation in meter and decameter wave ranges requires maximum utilisation of the transistor power capabilities. Transistors have no margins on the maximum permissible parameters and even minor derivations from normal mode can cause it fail. Known protection devices for band power amplifiers have a time constant greater than 20 - 30 us permissible overhead of transistor {{and can not}} protect the amplifier from short-circuit load or its failure. Helicon isolator at the output of transmitters for meter and decameter waves protects the transistor from the load mismatch and also decreases the <b>intermodulation</b> distortions <b>level.</b> The goal of this work is to study the on-turn transient of helicon isolator during the antenna break or short-circuit. Formulation of the problem. The maximum power dissipation in the helicon isolator depends on the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor resonator plate. In this work the transient processes in the helicon isolator after the sudden load mismatch are studied {{in order to reduce}} its sizes and weight for the given power level. Simulation. Temperature changes of the main part of helicon isolator ? helicon resonator with sizes 10 x 10 x 10 mm- 3 of indium antimonide dopped with tellurium with concentration 2. 1 1023 m- 3 are simulated in the approximation of one-dimensional model. The termal time constant was calculated. The resonator temperature variations are calculated with the different backward power levels. It is shown, that the time to reach the critical temperature 60 ?? for the isolator with 10 W dissipation power level is more than 0. 1 s and much more then required timeout for even simple emergency shutdown system of the band power amplifier for transmitters. Experimental results. Experimental study of the helicon isolator transient shows that the reverse attenuation decreases from - 23 dB to - 20 db in 0. 6 s and to - 15 dB in 1. 1 s. This timeout is enough to protect the transistor amplifier of the transmitter in emergency mode up to the power supply shutdown. Conclusion. Helicon isolators are efficient protection of transistor transmitters from load mismatch in meter and decameter wave ranges. The reflected power is adsorbed in the isolator at antenna break or short-circuits. The thermal time constant of the isolator is enough for even the very simple emergency power shutdown system to switch. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{lumped elements}} are crucial {{building blocks for}} designing any type of passives circuits for RF front-end applications in mobile devices. In particular, high-quality (Q) factor lumped elements are desirable for improving both insertion loss and noise performance. Integrated passive devices (IPD) technology is a platform that can provide miniature inductors, and capacitors with high- Q values that are unattainable with traditional CMOS technologies. Over the past several years, IPD technology {{has been used to}} implement devices such as filters, couplers and impedance-matching networks {{for a wide range of}} system-in-package applications. However, most of the IPD circuits do not yet have any tunable/reconfigurable functions for use in frequency agile applications. The objective of this research is to develop tunable integrated passive devices (IPDs) using barium strontium titanate (BST) and micro-electrical-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies. Another objective is to develop a fabrication process for monolithic integration of MEMS switches and IPD devices. A 4 -mask IPD glass/alumina-based fabrication process is developed at the University of Waterloo for the first time. Details of the modeling and characterization of high-Q lumped elements, L and C, are investigated. The RF performance of these elements is compared with that of similar designs fabricated in a commercial IPD foundry. To highlight the benefits of the IPD process, lumped element bandpass filters are designed, fabricated, and tested. BST varactors are integrated with IPD circuits to demonstrate a highly miniaturized tunable impedance matching network featuring a wide impedance coverage from 2 - 3 GHz and an insertion loss of approximately 1 dB. The network promises to be useful in a broad range of wireless applications. A high performance tunable IPD/BST bandstop filter with a wideband balun as a multichip module is also proposed. Reconfigurable IPD/BST bandpass filters with tunable transmission zeros are presented and investigated experimentally for operation under high power <b>levels.</b> <b>Intermodulation</b> test results are presented for the integrated IPD/BST devices. Making use of the fact that the IPD fabrication process is amenable to the realization of MEMS devices, the IPD process originally developed for realizing passive circuits is further expanded to accommodate monolithic integration of MEMS switches with IPD circuits. Contact-type MEMS switches are developed, fabricated and tested. Also, a monolithically integrated IPD/MEMS 3 -bit high resolution true-time delay network and high-Q switched-capacitor bank are fabricated and tested to demonstrate the benefits of integrating MEMS technology with the IPD technology...|$|R
