5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple who hate each other <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individual}} members of Congress <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> express their views and the views of their constituents {{with respect to their}} religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.|$|E

2500|$|Palin later {{clarified}} {{her position}} in a Facebook posting by stating: [...] "Voters <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> ask candidates for information if they so choose. I’ve pointed {{out that it was}} seemingly fair game during the 2008 election for many on the left to badger my doctor and lawyer for proof that Trig is in fact my child. Conspiracy-minded reporters and voters had a right to ask... which they have repeatedly. But at no point– not during the campaign, and not during recent interviews– have I asked the president to produce his birth certificate or suggested that he was not born in the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a U.S. Jewish {{civil rights}} {{group that had}} spoken out against anti-Muslim bigotry, denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project. Its head opined {{that some of those}} who oppose the project are [...] "bigots", and that the plan's proponents may <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build the center at that location. Nevertheless, the group {{recommended}} selecting a different location, and appealed to the builders to consider the sensitivities of the victims' families, saying that building the community center at that site would unnecessarily cause more pain for families of some victims of 9/11. As a consequence of their statement Fareed Zakaria the winner of the ADL's 2005 Hubert Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize has returned the prize and the prize money.|$|E
2500|$|As for why the {{complete}} 538 polling database {{had not been}} released publicly, Silver responded: [...] "The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again {{at the end of}} this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full".|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{has been}} criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the Ice and Fire series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, A Feast for Crows (2005), and the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons (2011). The {{previous}} year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have {{always been part of}} his working process. Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, [...] "George R. R. Martin is not your bitch." [...] Gaiman later went on to state that writers are not machines and that they <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work on other projects if they want to.|$|E
2500|$|On July 28, 2010, the ADL {{issued a}} {{statement}} in which it expressed opposition to the Park51 Community Center, which sponsors planned to build near the World Trade Center site in New York. The ADL stated, [...] "The controversy which has emerged regarding {{the building of a}} Community Center at this location is counterproductive to the healing process. Therefore, under these unique circumstances, we believe the City of New York would be better served if an alternative location could be found." [...] The ADL denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project. Foxman opined that some of those who oppose the mosque are [...] "bigots", and that the plan's proponents may <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build the mosque at that location. Nevertheless, he said that building the mosque at that site would unnecessarily cause more pain for families of some victims of 9/11.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs' {{letter was}} met with mixed reactions. Bloomberg {{highlighted}} several viewpoints. David Pakman, President of non-DRM music retailer eMusic, agreed with Jobs, stating that [...] "consumers prefer {{a world where the}} media they purchase is playable on any device, regardless of its manufacturer, and is not burdened by arbitrary usage restrictions. DRM only serves to restrict consumer choice, prevents a larger digital music market from emerging, and often makes consumers unwitting accomplices to the ambitions of technology companies". Mike Bebel, CEO of music subscription service Ruckus, explained his view that the letter was an effort to shift focus, saying that [...] "This is a way for Steve Jobs to take the heat off the fact that he won't open up his proprietary DRM. ... The labels <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> protect their content, and I don't see it as a vow of good partnership to turn the tables on the labels and tell them they should just get rid of all DRM... He is trying to spin the controversy." [...] An anonymous music label executive said that [...] "it's ironic that the guy who has the most successful example of DRM at every step of the process, the one where people bought boatloads of music last Christmas, is suddenly changing his tune". In an article from The New York Times, Ted Cohen, managing partner at TAG Strategic, commented that the change could be [...] "a clear win for the consumer electronics device world, but a potential disaster for the content companies". The Recording Industry Association of America put particular emphasis on Jobs' self-rejected idea about licensing its FairPlay technology to other companies, saying that such licensing would be [...] "a welcome breakthrough and would be a real victory for fans, artists and labels".|$|E

60|$|I. CHARITES.--The only change {{made in the}} {{nomenclature}} of {{this order}} is the slight one of 'rubra' for 'rubus': partly to express true sisterhood with the other Charites; partly to enforce the idea of redness, as characteristic of the race, both in the lovely purple and russet of their winter leafage, and in the exquisite bloom of scarlet on the stems in strong young shoots. They <b>have</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be placed among the Charites, first because the raspberry is really a more important fruit in domestic economy than the strawberry; and, secondly, because the wild bramble is often in its wandering sprays even more graceful than the rose; and in blossom and {196} fruit the best autumnal gift that English Nature has appointed for her village children.|$|E
