It is the first subminiature SLR. It took 25 14×21 mm frames using unperforated specially spooled 16 mm film in a Narciss cassette. Compact design with interchangeable lenses and <b>interchangeable</b> pentaprism <b>finders.</b> The Narciss camera was initially designed for medical use, it included a Narciss with ordinary pentaprism finder and a second magnifier pentaprism finder for medical use; {{there was also a}} microscope adapter ...|$|R
50|$|Most 35 mm SLRs use a roof {{pentaprism}} or penta-mirror {{to direct}} the light to the eyepiece, first used on the 1948 Duflex constructed by Jenő Dulovits and patented August 1943 (Hungary). With this camera also appeared the first Instant-return mirror.The first Japanese pentaprism SLR was the 1955 Miranda T, followed by the Asahi Pentax, Minolta SR-2, Zunow, Nikon F and the Yashica Pentamatic. Some SLRs offered removable pentaprisms with optional viewfinder capabilities, such as the waist-level <b>finder,</b> the <b>interchangeable</b> sports <b>finders</b> used on the Canon F1 and F1n; the Nikon F, F2, F3, F4 and F5; and the Pentax LX.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. [234]- 246). The {{detrimental effects}} {{exhibited by the}} conventional hydrocyclone in classifying ores that contain different density components motivated the AMIRA P 9 project to look into modifications to the conventional hydrocyclone that can improve separation by component density. In this project a cyclone termed the three-product cyclone has been developed and tested. The three-product cyclone is a modification of the conventional hydrocyclone with an additional vortex finder termed the inner vortex finder inserted concentric to the existing one, termed the outer vortex finder, resulting in three products from the same hydrocyclone. The three-product cyclone produces a finer overflow stream, an intermediate overflow stream comprising fine high density particles and medium sized light particles, and a coarse underflow stream. The work presented in this thesis involved designing an overflow arrangement which allowed <b>interchangeable</b> inner vortex <b>finders</b> to be tested, and a special rig for industrial scale experiments using a 600 mm diameter hydrocyclone...|$|R
