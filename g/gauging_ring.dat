40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} {{to improve the}} measurement of the stress response of materials to intense, short pulses of radiation. When Saturn fires, large prompt electrical noise pulses are induced in stress measurement circuits. The conventional wisdom {{has been that the}} shorted guard <b>ring</b> quartz <b>gauge</b> was the only configuration with acceptable prompt signal-to-noise characteristics for stress measurements in this pulsed radiation environment. However, because of abnormal signal distortion, the shorted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> is restricted to a maximum stress of about 8 kbars. Below this level, the normal, quantified signal distortion is correctable with analytical deconvolution techniques. The shunted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> is acceptable for Egli fidelity measurements to about 25 kbars with negligible signal distortion. Experiments were conducted on the Saturn soft x-ray source which show that higher fidelity shunted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> can successfully measure stress with acceptable induced noise. We also found that a 50 -ohm impedance matching resistor at the gauge reduced the prompt noise amplitude and improved the baseline quality of the measurement prior to shock wave arrival...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as plug <b>gauges</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>gauges.</b> However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{setup for}} non-tactile high-precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The aim is to overcome classical problems of tactile and radial roundness measurements such as the error influences of the used rotary table and the work piece alignment and thus to increase the accuracy and reduce the measurement time. To achieve those aims a double interferometer concept was chosen and combined with a measurement system for the work piece alignment, a high precision rotary table and an automated four-axes adjustment unit. The main alignment errors of the work pieces (e. g. <b>ring</b> <b>gauges)</b> such as eccentricity and tilting are either suppressed or directly detected and consequently reduced by the automated four-axes adjustment unit. Due to the non-tactile measurement concept and the contactless energy supply of the four-axes adjustment unit, the radial run of the rotary table is not affected.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{operator}} contact force influence {{on the performance of}} Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMMs) is presented in this paper. After developing a sensor capable of measuring the contact force applied by an operator, a <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> has been used to analyse the relationship between the contact force and diameter and form errors measured with the AACMM. As a result, contact force has been proved as one of the main factors influencing the AACMM performance. A probe deflection model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) has been also proposed in order to obtain the AACMM probe deflection caused by contact force. This allows measurement correction by comparing them with reference values, specifically, a <b>ring</b> <b>gauge.</b> Experimental test results show a significant measurement improvement that minimizes diameter error. Finally, an uncertainty evaluation for the contact force sensor and AACMM measurements with and without probe deflection model has been carried out in order to validate the ability of the sensor and the methodology followed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the current {{controversy}} surrounding the use of hemorheologic and vasodilator drugs in the treatment of peripheral arteriosclerosis, a comparative study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline, buflomedil, and nifedipine in 45 patients with peripheral arterial disease (Fontaine stage II). The patients in this prospective randomized study were divided into three groups: 15 patients received pentoxifylline treatment (1, 200 mg/day), 15 were treated with buflomedil (600 mg/day), and 15 with nifedipine (60 mg/day). Response to treatment was assessed {{at the start of the}} study and after forty-five and ninety days, by clinical examination, Doppler test, strain test, and digital occlusion plethysmography using a strain <b>gauge</b> <b>ring.</b> Pentoxifylline was significantly more effective (P < 0. 05) than buflomedil and nifedipine at ninety days in improving walking perfor-mance, resting toe pressure, resting and postexercise ankle/brachial pressure ratio, and basal/postischemic toe-pulse ratio. Significant differences within groups were also noted (continued on next page) at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 10, 2016 ang. sagepub. comDownloaded from 648 (Abstract continued) for initial claudication, toe peak-flow time, pulse reappearance time (PRT/ 2), and maximum postischemic flow time, together with significant intergroup variables.
