5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, he {{published}} a book called , outlining strategies with which <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> court middle-class voters. One of his aides at the time Daniel Squadron helped to write it, and they drew from the senator's experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, {{the race}} took an {{unexpected}} twist when Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot launched {{a third party}} bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters {{across the political spectrum}} disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility. Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.|$|E
50|$|Bergmanson {{continues}} {{to criticize the}} Democratic Party for being financially irresponsible. He has stated that he believes only a fiscally conservative <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> potentially beat sitting Governor Chris Christie. On February 8, 2013, {{he announced that he}} would seek the Democratic nomination in the 2013 gubernatorial election. He withdrew from the Democratic primary on April 22.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Parker had {{supported}} Bryan in 1896 and 1900, Bryan hated him for being a Gold Democrat. Bryan wanted the weakest man nominated, one who could not take {{the control of the}} party away from him. He denounced Judge Parker as a tool of Wall Street before he was nominated and declared that no self-respecting <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> vote for him.|$|R
5000|$|John Nichols of the Madison Capital Times in Wisconsin saw it differently. [...] "The {{district}} {{had been}} so radically gerrymandered by Republican governors and legislators that it was all-but-unimaginable that a <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> ever be competitive there" [...] and that Hackett, [...] "a smart telegenic Iraq War veteran", had been [...] "swiftboated" [...] {{in the final days}} of the campaign by [...] "Republican operatives and right-wing talk radio hosts".|$|R
25|$|Just {{before the}} election, {{it had been}} {{anticipated}} {{by the media and}} opinion polls that the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> win up to 100 seats and place them close to the Conservatives in terms of seats as well as votes. They won 62 seats (22.1% of the vote), their greatest number of seats since 1923 but significantly less than most observers had expected the party to win.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{internal}} conflict over GST (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline {{occurred in the}} Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the Australian Greens who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial third party. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al. Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> make a political comeback in the federal arena.|$|E
25|$|Because Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> {{be elected}} as list-free {{candidates}} while {{the party was}} outlawed, SPD {{continued to be a}} growing force in the Reichstag, becoming the strongest party in 1912 (in imperial Germany, the parliamentary balance of forces had no influence on the formation of the cabinet). During this period, SPD deputies in the Reichstag were able to win some improvements in working and living conditions for working-class Germans, thereby advancing the cause of its policies in a general way and securing material benefits for its supporters.|$|E
50|$|As expected, the 2002 {{race was}} very close. Matheson {{defeated}} State Representative John Swallow by only 1,600 votes, {{largely due to}} a 25,800-vote margin over John Swallow in Salt Lake County. According {{to at least one}} study, some extra financial help from the Republican Party might have helped Swallow defeat Matheson. However, national Republicans stayed out of the race after state legislators claimed they had drawn a district that no <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> possibly win.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} is currently represented by Liberal Democrat , who is serving his third term. In the 2009 general election, the 7th district {{was the only}} district countrywide where a Democratic incumbent lost their seat and the only district in Hokkaidō won by the LDP. In the previous election of 2005 when the LDP won a landslide victory, {{it was one of}} few districts where a <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> unseat a Liberal Democratic incumbent.|$|R
5000|$|John Nichols of the The Capital Times (Madison, Wisconsin) saw it differently. [...] "The {{district}} {{had been}} so radically gerrymandered by Republican governors and legislators {{that it was all}} but unrecognizable that a <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> ever be competitive there" [...] and Hackett, [...] "a smart telegenic Iraq war veteran," [...] had been [...] "swift-boated" [...] {{in the final days of}} the campaign by Republican operatives and [...] "right-wing talk hosts" [...] such as Rush Limbaugh.|$|R
25|$|In May 2007, it was {{reported}} that McCain had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including Tim Johnson, who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> sometimes delay votes in order to accommodate the schedules of Democratic presidential candidates.|$|E
25|$|Many Gore {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} third-party candidate Nader {{acted as a}} spoiler in the election since Nader votes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush. Nader received 2.74 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 overvotes) and 22,000 votes in New Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes. Winning either state would have won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including Dan Perkins, argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including Workers World Party candidate Monica Moorehead, who received 1,500 votes. But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{election}} meant <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} break a filibuster in the Senate. In response, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale {{back to a}} less ambitious bill; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing Emanuel's scaled-down approach as [...] "Kiddie Care".|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, Mother Jones {{magazine}} named Harris {{as one of}} [...] "11 <b>Democrats</b> Who <b>Could</b> Defeat President Trump in 2020".|$|R
50|$|Although Alaska {{is heavily}} Republican, popular opinion had swung against the Murkowski family {{because of a}} tax {{increase}} passed by Governor Frank Murkowski, Lisa Murkowski's father. In addition, many voters disapproved of apparent nepotism in the appointment of Lisa Murkowski to the Senate. Knowles, who as mentioned above preceded Frank Murkowski as governor, had enlisted extensive out-of-state support for his bid to take over Lisa Murkowski's Senate seat. However, veteran Republican Senator Ted Stevens taped advertisements warning Alaskans that electing a <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> result in less federal dollars for Alaska.|$|R
5000|$|... "That victory {{proved that}} {{the wall of the}} <b>Democrat</b> stronghold <b>could</b> be breached, was a signal event -- a first step toward a two-party system and its wide-ranging benefits.|$|R
500|$|Democrat Nancy Pelosi, {{who served}} as the Speaker from January 2007 through January 2011, asked her Democratic colleagues for their vote in the election. Steny Hoyer, the House Minority Whip, said that he {{expected}} that the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of Democrats to vote for Pelosi. He said that if a Republican could not get the votes needed, <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> consider their options.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge told Beck {{he would}} not accept the {{nomination}} because it would split the Democrats and ensure the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln. On June 25, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis proposed that Breckinridge should accept the nomination; his strength in the South would convince Douglas that his own candidacy was futile. Breckinridge, Douglas, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell would withdraw, and <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> nominate a compromise candidate. Breckinridge accepted the nomination, but maintained {{that he had not}} sought it and that he had been nominated [...] "against my expressed wishes". Davis's compromise plan failed when Douglas refused to withdraw, believing his supporters would vote for Lincoln rather than a compromise candidate.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Bayh {{decided to}} vote against the confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States. This move was judged by some political commentators as [...] "posturing" [...] for the 2008 race. Detractors stated that Bayh voted against the judge to appeal to the liberals of the party, as other possible candidates voted in a similar manner. The next month, Bayh attended the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner in New Hampshire. At the event he accused President Bush of dividing the nation and stated that he believed <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> win in red states (traditional Republican states) if they stood up for [...] "American values".|$|E
50|$|Leslie County {{is one of}} forty-four United States {{counties}} to have never voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate since its creation in 1878. In 1892 and 1916 {{it was the most}} Republican county in the nation. Leslie’s fierce Unionist sympathies, so strong that areas surrounding it contributed more troops to the Union Army relative to population than any other part of the United States, meant that between 1896 and 1928 no <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> receive even ten percent of the county’s vote, and none received so much as twenty percent until Lyndon Johnson flukishly managed over 47 percent in his landslide national triumph against Barry Goldwater in 1964.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{election}} the Labour party formed the administration after becoming the largest {{party in the}} 2003 election. Their administration however was criticised by the Audit Commission, which raised the hopes of the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> that <b>could</b> regain control of the council.|$|R
50|$|Former Congressman Dan Boren {{was viewed}} by some Oklahoma {{political}} operatives {{as the only}} <b>Democrat</b> who <b>could</b> make the 2016 race competitive, but was seen as unlikely to run. Lankford's 2014 special election opponent Constance N. Johnson has said that she plans to run again.|$|R
500|$|After the 1998 election, Janmaat became {{increasingly}} worried by legal pressure, {{believing that the}} Centre <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> become the government's next target after CP'86 was officially banned in 1998. He founded the [...] "Conservative Democrats" [...] as a potential successor party {{in the event that}} the Centre Democrats was proscribed. The new party contested the 1999 European elections as the Lijstverbinding Centrumdemocraten/Conservatieve Democraten, a supposed two-party cooperation, where the two names in reality represented the same party. It won only 0.5% of the vote in the election, a showing widely seen as the last spasm of a dying party. Janmaat's increasing physical exhaustion only served to exacerbate the situation. Nonetheless, with a new political climate following the September 11 attacks and the rise of Pim Fortuyn, Janmaat sought political rehabilitation in his final years. The reason was that his earlier criminal convictions arose from stating things that had now become accepted.|$|E
500|$|Although Clay {{had hoped}} the Compromise {{would be a}} final {{settlement}} {{on the matter of}} slavery that could unite the nation, it divided his Whig Party, especially when the 1852 Whig National Convention endorsed it to the anger of liberal northerners like Seward. [...] The major candidates for the presidential nomination were President Fillmore, Senator Daniel Webster, and General Scott. Seward supported Scott, who he hoped like Harrison could unite enough voters behind a military hero to win the election. Scott gained the nomination, and Seward campaigned for him. With the Whigs unable to reconcile over slavery, whereas the <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> unite behind the Compromise, the Whigs won only four states, and former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce was elected president. Other events, such as the 1852 publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and Northern anger over the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act (an element of the Compromise), widened the divide between North and South.|$|E
500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I knew that I was in for it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter, Toledano {{became a}} Republican {{and ran for}} mayor of his home city in the general {{election}} held on March 1, 1970. Toledano is descended from Louis XIV of France and Spanish and French colonists. His mother, the former Beeyce Casanas (1908-1991), was Queen of Rex in 1929. However, many in the upper class refused to support Toledano in the mayoral campaign against the Democratic nominee Moon Landrieu, a former protégé of the late Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison and the father of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu and current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. Toledano said that members of the upper class often told him that they favored Landrieu because they believed the <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> deal better with African American relations than would Toledano.|$|R
500|$|Agnew's {{chances in}} 1962 were boosted by a feud in the Democrat ranks, as the retired former county executive, Michael Birmingham, fell {{out with his}} {{successor}} and defeated him in the Democratic primary. By contrast with his elderly opponent, Agnew was able to campaign as a [...] "White Knight" [...] promising change; his program included an anti-discrimination bill requiring public amenities such as parks, bars and restaurants be open to all races, policies that neither Birmingham nor any Maryland <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> have introduced at that time without angering supporters. In the November election, despite an intervention by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on Birmingham's behalf, Agnew beat his opponent by 78,487 votes to 60,993. When Symington lost to Democrat Clarence Long in his congressional race, Agnew became the highest-ranking Republican in Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was rumored}} {{for years that}} Pittman died before his final {{election}} in 1940, and that Democratic party leaders kept the body in Reno's Riverside Hotel bathtub full of ice until he was reelected so Governor Edward Carville, a fellow <b>Democrat,</b> <b>could</b> appoint a replacement. While the rumor was false the truth was, as former Nevada State Archivist Guy Rocha wrote, [...] "just as disreputable". Pittman suffered a severe heart attack just before the election on November 5, and two doctors told his aides before the election that death was imminent. To avoid affecting the election, the party told the press that the senator was hospitalized for exhaustion and that his condition was not serious. Pittman died on November 10 at the Washoe General Hospital in Reno, Nevada.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{his health}} was poor, Byrd was present for every crucial vote during the December 2009 Senatorial {{healthcare}} debate; his vote was necessary so <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> obtain cloture {{to break a}} Republican filibuster. At the final vote on December 24, 2009, Byrd referenced recently deceased Senator Ted Kennedy, a devoted proponent, when casting his vote: [...] "Mr. President, this is for my friend Ted Kennedy! Aye!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., {{subsequently}} {{stated that}} it was not the position of the University nor officials that <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> not be Christians. The head of the College Democrats, Brian O'Nill Diaz, was quoted as saying he was baffled by the administration's decision, [...] "I {{want to be able to}} share the love of Christ, but I guess I can't do that on campus because I'm a Democrat as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, {{research}} company Democratic Audit published its findings about {{the review of}} constituency boundaries. The organisation attempted to create a set of boundaries for the UK {{according to the new}} rules, and to examine their political consequences. Their studies suggested that the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>could</b> lose [...] "a quarter" [...] of their current seats. Provisional notional results published in January 2012 calculated that the Conservatives could have won 299 seats under the new boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Coon was a {{tangential}} {{figure in}} the Arkansas Whitewater scandal of the 1990s. Judge David Hale made Coon {{an officer of the}} National Savings Life Insurance Company, a burial insurance firm. In 1998, Hale was scheduled to be tried in Arkansas state court for fraud in connection with the company, but his medical needs — a heart condition — halted the proceedings. In 1995, Samuel Dash, the ethics counsel to Whitewater special prosecutor Ken Starr informed Mark Stodola of the Pulaski County (Little Rock) prosecutor's office, that Stodola, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>could</b> be prosecuted for obstruction of justice if he proceeded with charges against Hale. Dash told Stodola that Hale was cooperating in a federal investigation. Starr said {{that he would like to}} handle the insurance fraud matter at Hale's federal sentencing, but Stodola filed state charges against Hale.|$|R
5000|$|On January 27, 2008, their cousin Caroline Kennedy (President John F. Kennedy's daughter) {{announced}} in a New York Times op-ed piece entitled, [...] "A President Like My Father", {{that she would}} endorse Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. On the same day, her uncle Senator Ted Kennedy {{announced that he would}} endorse Obama despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so. Senator Kennedy's endorsement was considered among the most influential that any <b>Democrat</b> <b>could</b> get. In particular, it raised the possibility of improving Obama's vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats. It was later followed by an announcement that his son Congressman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island's 1st District would also endorse Obama. Obama was also subsequently endorsed by Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, and two of their children, Max Kennedy and Rory Kennedy ...|$|R
5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} {{its share of}} the vote to 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden <b>Democrats,</b> Reinfeldt <b>could</b> remain in government, but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.|$|R
