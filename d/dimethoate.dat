2500|$|Various pathologies {{can affect}} olives. The most serious pest is the {{olive fruit fly}} (Dacus oleae or Bactrocera oleae) which lays its eggs in the olive most {{commonly}} just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding [...] the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, the practice has been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. <b>dimethoate).</b> [...] Classic organic methods have now been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, and spraying with kaolin. [...] Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethoate</b> is {{a widely}} used {{organophosphate}} insecticide and acaricide. It was patented and introduced in the 1950s by American Cyanamid. Like other organophosphates, <b>dimethoate</b> is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which disables cholinesterase, an enzyme essential for central nervous system function. It acts both by contact and through ingestion. It is readily absorbed and distributed throughout plant tissues, and is degraded relatively rapidly.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatments}} {{are carried out}} by spraying the olive trees with insecticides (<b>dimethoate,</b> deltamethrin, and phosmet). <b>Dimethoate</b> is commonly used for its effectiveness and relatively low cost. It may be preferable because it would leave few residues in olive oil, since it is water-soluble and would pass through the amurca. In the near future, legislative authorization for the withdrawal of use of <b>dimethoate</b> is to be implemented. Among the products with low impact, azadirachtin is a natural repellent extracted from {{the fruits of the}} neem tree. However, its effectiveness against the olive fruit fly has not yet been sufficiently tested. Among the organic insecticide literature, rotenone is also mentioned, but the use of this active ingredient, not readily available, must be authorized by established competent bodies after demonstrating the need for it.|$|E
50|$|The fly {{has been}} the subject of {{extensive}} control regimes including a Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone where it is forbidden to take fruit, and post-harvest dipping of fruit in <b>dimethoate</b> and fenthion. As of October 2011, the use of these chemicals was under review by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), with <b>dimethoate</b> suspended from use. In May 2012, January 2013 and February 2015 the fly was found in Auckland, posing a risk to horticulture and leading to a quarantine.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were also}} {{allegations}} {{of violence against}} the activists. Protesters alleged that farm workers had poisoned them with an organophosphate pesticide spray. Environmental health officers confirmed that they found [...] "substantial amounts" [...] of <b>dimethoate,</b> described by the Independent as a potentially lethal pesticide, on a roadside verge where protesters often stood. Sixteen activists complained of nausea, sore throats, headaches, and difficulty breathing. Christopher Brown {{said that he had}} not sprayed the verge and that his farm did not use <b>dimethoate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} used as a food plant for the larvae {{of a number of}} the Lepidoptera order (see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples). Aphids are also very common sap-feeders on maples. In horticultural {{applications}} a <b>dimethoate</b> spray will solve this.|$|E
50|$|Foliar spray on {{agricultural}} {{crops and}} ornamentals, and in or around agricultural and domestic buildings for mite control. It is formulated as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, ready-to-use liquids, and aerosol sprays. In many countries, dicofol {{is also used}} {{in combination with other}} pesticides such as the organophosphates, methyl parathion, and <b>dimethoate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scheduled pest {{management}} usually occurs with periodic preventive treatments {{from the period}} when the larvae appear during an average infestation (from midsummer in areas with higher incidence or in September in areas with lower incidence). The treatment is repeated on average every 20 days (in the case of <b>dimethoate)</b> or at the interval of active use. The downside to the scheduled treatment is the risk of carrying out unnecessary treatments.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{measures}} to control sawflies can be taken. Mechanical methods include removing larvae from trees and killing them by squishing or dropping them into boiling water or kerosene, {{although this is}} not practical in plantations. Predators {{can also be used}} to eliminate larvae, as well as parasites which have been previously used in control programs. Small trees can be sprayed with a number of chemicals, including maldison, <b>dimethoate</b> and carbaryl, if removing larvae from trees is not effective enough.|$|E
50|$|C. brunneus {{are used}} as a bioindicators for heavy metal pollution. They are {{commonly}} found living in habitats that are polluted with heavy metals such as Szopienice and Olkusz in Poland. Some sites have heavy metal concentrations as high as 124.3±15.9 mg•kg-1. Individuals can have heavy metal concentrations as larger as 21.25 mg•kg-1. Exposure to heavy metal concentrations alters catalytic ability of enzymes. Individuals from heavily polluted sites have increased glutathione concentrations and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity. In the lab, individuals exposed to zinc during diapause have lower glutathione concentrations. <b>Dimethoate</b> exposure enhances the effect of heavy metal exposure decreasing glutathione concentrations and reducing acetylcholinesterase activity by almost 50%. Exposure to <b>dimethoate</b> also decreases glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and carboxylesterases activity. Because C. brunneus in non polluted reference sites do not experience the same decrease in enzyme activities, researchers {{have suggested that the}} decreased enzyme activities can be contributed to the tradeoff associated with adapting to living in heavily polluted habitats. Individuals are forced to allocate more energy towards neutralizing harmful effects of heavy metals instead of allocating the energy to growth and development.|$|E
50|$|In industry, {{chloroacetic acid}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} {{of a wide variety of}} useful compounds (e.g. drugs, dyes, and pesticides). Most reactions take advantage of the high reactivity of the C-Cl bond. It is the precursor to the herbicide glyphosate, and the herbicides MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid) and <b>dimethoate</b> are prepared by alkylation with chloroacetic acid. Chloroacetic acid is converted to chloroacetyl chloride, a precursor to adrenaline (epinephrine). Displacement of chloride by sulfide gives thioglycolic acid, which is used as a stabilizer in PVC and a component in some cosmetics.|$|E

50|$|Imidacloprid {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{insecticides}} to the western honeybee, Apis mellifera. The toxicity of imidacloprid to Apis mellifera differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg a.i./bee (micrograms of active ingredient per bee). The acute oral LD50 ranges from 0.005 µg a.i./bee to 0.07 µg a.i./bee, which makes imidacloprid more toxic to the bees than the organophosphate <b>dimethoate</b> (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid cypermethrin (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee). Other insecticides that are equally or more toxic than imidacloprid include spinosad, emamectin benzoate, fipronil, and the neonicotinoids clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran.|$|E
50|$|The {{preventive}} {{treatments are}} carried out by spraying the olive grove with poisoned protein baits. The adults, being glycogenic, are attracted by nitrogenous substances necessary to supplement their low protein diet. The substances used as bait for the flies are protein hydrolysates and are poisoned with organophosphate insecticides (usually <b>dimethoate).</b> The treatment should {{be carried out by}} spraying only part of the canopy of the trees, preferably the highest point nearest the sun. The intervention threshold for adulticide treatments are quite low (two or three adults per trap per week). Recently, the introduction of ready-made protein baits containing Dow Agrosciences Spinosad®biological insecticide also are authorized in organic farming.|$|E
50|$|To {{members of}} the genus Apis, the honey bees, {{imidacloprid}} {{is one of the}} most toxic chemicals ever created as an insecticide. The acute oral LD50 ranges from 5 to 70 picograms of active ingredient per bee, making it more toxic to bees than the organophosphate <b>dimethoate</b> (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid cypermethrin (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee). (For comparison, the weight of just the DNA of a human cell is about 7 picograms.) The toxicity of imidacloprid to bees differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg active ingredient per bee.|$|E
40|$|Current {{study is}} based on {{biodegradation}} of organophosphorus pesticide <b>dimethoate</b> in liquid MSM medium with P. sutzeri.

40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{investigation}} on the kinetics of <b>dimethoate</b> biodegradation and an estimation of residual <b>dimethoate</b> in bacterial culture by spectrophotometry. The methylene chloride extract of the culture medium was used for determination of <b>dimethoate</b> through its reaction with 1 chloro- 2, 4 dinitrobenzene to produce methylamine whose absorbance at 505 nm gave an estimation of <b>dimethoate</b> content. The <b>dimethoate</b> standard curve follows Beer’s law at 505 nm with a slope of 0. 0129 absorbance units per µg/mL. The regression equation relating concentration of <b>dimethoate</b> (x) with the absorbance is (y) : y = 0. 037 + 0. 0129 x. The amount of residual <b>dimethoate</b> after 7 days were 0, 4, 17, 28 and 29 µg/mL; the rate constants were 0. 775, 0. 305, 0. 225, 0. 167 and 0. 127 each per day, and the efficiency of <b>dimethoate</b> degradation were 100 %, 96 %, 83 %, 72 % and 71 %, for Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus pumilus respectively. <b>Dimethoate</b> remediation could be attained through bacterial metabolism of the pesticide and colorimetric analysis might be useful in the estimation of <b>dimethoate</b> within a detection limit of 5 - 100 µg/mL...|$|E
40|$|The Bacillus licheniformis strain {{isolated}} from the intestine of Labeo rohita by an enrichment technique showed capability of utilizing <b>dimethoate</b> as the sole source of carbon. The bacterium rapidly utilized <b>dimethoate</b> beyond 0. 6 [*]mg/mL and showed prolific growth in a mineral salts medium containing 0. 45 [*]mg/mL <b>dimethoate.</b> The isolated B licheniformis exhibited high level of tolerance of <b>dimethoate</b> (3. 5 [*]mg/mL) in nutrient broth, while its cured mutant did not tolerate <b>dimethoate</b> beyond 0. 45 [*]mg/mL and it was unable to utilize <b>dimethoate.</b> The wild B licheniformis strain transferred <b>dimethoate</b> degradation property to E coli C 600 (Nar, F−) strain. The transconjugant harbored a plasmid of the same molecular size (approximately 54 [*]kb) {{as that of the}} donor plasmid; the cured strain was plasmid less.

40|$|Residue {{levels of}} <b>dimethoate</b> and its oxon {{metabolite}} (omethoate) during tea planting, manufacturing, and brewing were investigated using a modified QuEChERS sample preparation and gas chromatography. Dissipation of <b>dimethoate</b> and its metabolite in tea plantation followed the first-order kinetic with a half-life of 1. 08 - 1. 27 d.

Processing factors of <b>dimethoate</b> {{are in the range}} of 2. 11 - 2. 41 and 1. 41 - 1. 70 during green tea and black tea manufacturing, respectively. Omethoate underwent generation as well as dissipation during tea manufacturing. Sum of <b>dimethoate</b> and omethoate led to a large portion of 80. 5 - 84. 9 % transferring into tea infusion. Results of safety evaluation indicated that omethoate could bring higher human health risk than <b>dimethoate</b> due to its higher hazard quotient by drinking tea.

At 2 weeks after treatment, the addition of cyhalothrin-lambda or <b>dimethoate</b> insecticides to sethoxydim, quizalofop-p-ethyl, bentazon, fomesafen and bentazon plus fomesafen did not increase injury at the Exeter and Ridgetown locations except for bentazon plus <b>dimethoate</b> which caused greater injury than bentazon alone (2. 9 % vs 0. 2 %) in 2006. However at Harrow, the addition of <b>dimethoate</b> to quizalofop-p-ethyl increased injury (0 % vs 4. 9 %) in 2007 and the addition cyhalothrin-lambda or <b>dimethoate</b> to sethoxydim increased injury in 2008 in dry bean. The addition of cyhalothrin-lambda to quizalofop-p-ethyl also increased injury (0 % vs 4. 5 %) in 2008. There was no adverse effect on dry bean injury with other treatments at Harrow in 2007 or 2008.

40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{insecticide}} self-poisoning {{is responsible}} for about one-quarter of global suicides. Treatment focuses {{on the fact that}} OP compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE); however, AChE-reactivating drugs do not benefit poisoned humans. We therefore studied the role of solvent coformulants in OP toxicity in a novel minipig model of agricultural OP poisoning. Gottingen minipigs were orally poisoned with clinically relevant doses of agricultural emulsifiable concentrate (EC) <b>dimethoate,</b> <b>dimethoate</b> active ingredient (AI) alone, or solvents. Cardiorespiratory physiology and neuromuscular (NMJ) function, blood AChE activity, and arterial lactate concentration were monitored for 12  h to assess poisoning severity. Poisoning with agricultural <b>dimethoate</b> EC 40, but not saline, caused respiratory arrest within 30  min, severe distributive shock and NMJ dysfunction, that was similar to human poisoning. Mean arterial lactate rose to 15. 6 [SD 2. 8] mM in poisoned pigs compared to 1. 4 [0. 4] in controls. Moderate toxicity resulted from poisoning with <b>dimethoate</b> AI alone, or the major solvent cyclohexanone. Combining <b>dimethoate</b> with cyclohexanone reproduced severe poisoning characteristic of agricultural <b>dimethoate</b> EC poisoning. A formulation without cyclohexanone showed less mammalian toxicity. These results indicate that solvents {{play a crucial role in}} <b>dimethoate</b> toxicity. Regulatory assessment of pesticide toxicity should include solvents as well as the AIs which currently dominate the assessment. Reformulation of OP insecticides to ensure that the agricultural product has lower mammalian toxicity could result in fewer deaths after suicidal ingestion and rapidly reduce global suicide rates...|$|E

Pesticides residues were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The ability of these biological agents to detoxify and clean up these pesticide residues in both soil and plants was studied. In soil samples, the highest percentages of malathion-degradation were ≥ 60 and ≥ 90 % after 28 and 42 days, respectively. The half-life times of malathion were accounted by 24, 23, 25 and 25 days for Amaranth, Kidney bean, Lettuce and Watercress, respectively. For <b>dimethoate,</b> results of time course studies in soil degradation revealed that Amaranth and Kidney bean were the most effective plants in <b>dimethoate</b> degradation, whereas ≥ 90 % was degraded after 42 days. The half-life times of <b>dimethoate</b> were accounted by 28, 30, 25 and 30 days for Amaranth, Kidney bean, Lettuce and Watercress, respectively. In plant tissues, only ≤ 5 and ≤ 3 % of malathion and <b>dimethoate</b> still in plant tissue, respectively. These results suggest that phytoremediation ability of plants could accelerate the degradation of malathion and <b>dimethoate</b> residues in plant tissues.
