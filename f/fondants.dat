50|$|Sugar candy is any candy {{whose primary}} {{ingredient}} is sugar. The main types of sugar candies are hard candies, <b>fondants,</b> caramels, jellies, and nougats.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{to create}} a lace heart, a patch of white <b>fondant</b> is rolled out first on a {{silicone}} mat. Then an embossed <b>fondant</b> roller is slowly rolled {{across the surface of}} the <b>fondant.</b> A heart shaped cookie cutter is used to cut out the <b>fondant</b> hearts. The heart shaped <b>fondant</b> is then peeled off the silicone mat carefully so as not to mar the embossed design. Next, the <b>fondant</b> is trimmed and placed on top of the cookie. Finally the fondant-covered cookie may be brushed with a light dusting of pearl luster dust.|$|R
5000|$|Rolled <b>fondant,</b> <b>fondant</b> icing, or pettinice, {{which is}} not the same {{material}} as poured <b>fondant,</b> is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. Although wedding cakes are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, <b>fondant</b> is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled <b>fondant</b> includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. It can also be made using powdered sugar and melted marshmallows. Rolled <b>fondant</b> is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> {{is another}} type of icing {{that is used to}} {{decorate}} cookies. <b>Fondant</b> can be colored by kneading the coloring into the dough. It can be rolled out, and then cut in shapes to match the cookies or their designs. <b>Fondant</b> can be purchased ready-made; however it is not favored for its taste. A homemade <b>fondant</b> that is often praised for its taste and function is marshmallow <b>fondant,</b> which is also used by cake decorators for covering cakes.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{he found}} his way to Paris, working in a {{restaurant}} and pastry shop near the Opéra Garnier. He soon mastered {{all there was to}} learn in Paris and on the advice his employer he went to West Germany where techniques were more advanced. Mesnier lived in Hamburg and Hanover and learned how to make cakes, cookies, <b>fondants,</b> and marzipan modeling as well as mastering the German and English languages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} uses of betanins are in {{coloring}} {{ice cream and}} powdered soft drink beverages; other uses are in some sugar confectionery, e.g. <b>fondants,</b> sugar strands, sugar coatings, and fruit or cream fillings. In hot processed candies, {{it can be used}} if added at the final part of the processing. Betanin is also used in soups as well as tomato and bacon products. Betanin has [...] "not been implicated as causing clinical food allergy when used as a coloring agent".|$|E
50|$|Chocolate {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the Belgian economy, and there are over 2,000 chocolatiers in the country, both small and large. Today, chocolate is very popular in Belgium, with 172,000 tonnes produced each year, and widely exported. Côte d'Or is probably the largest commercial brand, with their products available in virtually every grocery store in the country. The largest manufacturers of wider varieties of chocolates are mentioned at Pralines. Belgian pralines (<b>fondants)</b> shaped like sea shells, fish, diamonds and individualist creations topped with are sold in town centre shops, market stands and many village shops across Belgium.|$|E
50|$|An {{impression}} mat can be {{used with}} <b>fondant</b> to add design and/or texture. First the <b>fondant</b> is rolled out and then the mat is placed face down on the <b>fondant.</b> Finally, by gently but firmly going over the mat with the rolling pin, the impression is made in the <b>fondant.</b> Then the shapes are cut out.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> is a {{creative}} form of frosting style that is rolled out and draped over tiers. Its smooth, firm sugar icing is often embellished with appliqués, gum-paste flowers, or royal-icing details. <b>Fondant</b> {{can be cut}} into designs, formed into shapes, flavored or tinted. Poured <b>fondant</b> is used to glaze petits fours and other detailed confections. Such <b>fondant</b> gives a glossy finish and a sweet sugary taste.|$|R
50|$|The {{rolled out}} <b>fondant</b> may be cut into shapes {{with the same}} cookie cutters used to cut the cookies. Once cut out, the <b>fondant</b> is placed {{on top of the}} cookie. Some types of <b>fondant</b> will adhere right away to the cookie. If the <b>fondant</b> doesn't stick well, the cookie surface may be brushed with a little vanilla extract, corn syrup or piping gel to provide more {{sticking}} power.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} cricut machine had cutting mats of 6 × 12 inches, {{the larger}} Cricut Expression only allows mats of 12 × 12 and 12 × 24. The largest machine will produce letters from {{a half inch}} to 23 inches high. Both the Cricut and Cricut Expression require mats and blades which can be adjusted to cut through various types of paper, vinyl and other sheet products. The Cricut personal paper cutter operates as a paper cutter based upon cutting parameters programmed into the machine, and resembles a desktop printer. Cricut Cake produces stylized edible <b>fondants</b> cut into various shapes from fondant sheets, and is used by chefs in the preparation and ornamentation of cakes.|$|E
50|$|Sculpting <b>fondant</b> {{is similar}} to rolled <b>fondant</b> but with a stiffer consistency, {{which makes it a}} good {{sculpting}} material.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fondant</b> icing, also {{commonly}} referred to simply as <b>fondant</b> ( [...] , from the [...] ), is an edible icing used to decorate or sculpt cakes and pastries. It is made from sugar, water, gelatin, and glycerol. It {{does not have the}} texture of most icings; rolled <b>fondant</b> is akin to stiff clay, while poured <b>fondant</b> is a thick liquid. The word, in French, means [...] "melting", coming from the same root as fondue and foundry.|$|R
50|$|Using {{this new}} form of <b>fondant</b> artistry should be used on a heavy cake consistency. It can, however, be used on the {{traditional}} cake mix purchased in a store. <b>Fondant</b> is heavier than traditional knife spread frosting. Pre-made <b>fondant</b> that {{is available in the}} cake decorating section in stores has little flavoring. A homemade <b>fondant</b> can be made quickly for very little cost, and tends to have a better flavor than the pre-made store bought version.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> potatoes, or pommes <b>fondant,</b> is {{a method}} of {{preparing}} potatoes that traditionally involves cutting them into cylinders, browning the ends, and then slowly roasting them in butter and stock.|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{series of}} {{experiments}} on the preparation of <b>fondant</b> sweets with partial replacement of sugar by 2 - 4 % of chicory semi-product were carried out. The analysis of differential and integral distribution curves of particles and sucrose crystals in <b>fondant</b> showed that dispersity reduces {{with the increase in}} the chicory content. The effect of fructose and fiber on <b>fondant</b> structure formation was evaluated. A fructose, being an antycrystallizer, delays the crystal structure formation, the fiber due to the high hydrophilicity and water retention capacity on the one hand enhances the supersaturation of the liquid phase, {{and on the other hand}} increases mass effective viscosity, which results in the formation of the crystal structure and the liquid phase of high viscosity. <b>Fondant</b> rheological characteristics were defined. Analysis of <b>fondant</b> mass flow curves with powdered chicory semi-product showed them to be pseudo plastic rheological bodies regardless of the recipe. Structural and mechanical properties of the <b>fondant</b> mass during molding depend on the moisture and other liquid components contents, temperature, strain rate, mechanical impact duration, etc. Studies of <b>fondant</b> mass structuring process in room conditions (20 °C) showed that structure formation process accelerates with increase in chicory concentration and the plastic strength of sweets is significantly higher at 3 % chicory content as compared to 2 % content. A comparative analysis of <b>fondant</b> sweets quality indexes with various chicory dosages was carried out. Increase in dosage of additives in sweets increases the percentage of reducing substances that slows drying of products during storage and extends their shelf life. The increase in dosage of additives in sweets increases the percentage of reducing substances that slow drying of products during storage and extend their shelf life. The liquid phase content is directly proportional to the dosage of chicory. The technology of making <b>fondant</b> sweets with addition of roasted chicory semi-product while tempering <b>fondant</b> is developed. High nutritional value product was obtained and technological characteristics of production were enhanced by increasing the viscosity and the plastic strength of <b>fondant.</b> The duration of the <b>fondant</b> sweets structure formation while proving significantly reduced, and scrap rate decreased...|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{shelf-stable}} rolled <b>fondant</b> often consists principally {{of sugar}} and hydrogenated oil. However, different formulations for commercial shelf-stable <b>fondant</b> are available and include other ingredients, such as sugar, cellulose gum, and water.|$|R
50|$|A {{black-and-white}} cookie, or half-and-half cookie, is a soft, sponge-cake-like shortbread {{which is}} iced on one half with vanilla <b>fondant,</b> {{and on the}} other half by chocolate <b>fondant.</b> This cookie was created in Germany.|$|R
2500|$|Cadbury Creme Eggs are {{manufactured}} as two half-egg chocolate shells, {{each of which}} is filled with a white <b>fondant,</b> then topped with a smaller amount of yellow <b>fondant.</b> Both halves are then quickly joined together and cooled, the chocolate bonding together in the process. The solid eggs are removed from the moulds and wrapped in foil. [...] The filling, to be more precise, is inverted sugar syrup, produced by processing the <b>fondant</b> with invertase.|$|R
5000|$|Poured <b>fondant</b> is {{a creamy}} {{confection}} {{used as a}} filling or coating for cakes, pastries, and candies or sweets.In its simplest form, it is sugar and water stabilized with gelatin and glycerine. It is cooked to the soft-ball stage, cooled slightly, and stirred or beaten to incorporate air, until it is an opaque mass with a creamy consistency. Sometimes lemon or vanilla {{is added to the}} mixture for taste. Other flavorings are used as well, as are various colorings. An example of its use is the Cadbury Creme Egg, the filling of which is inverted sugar syrup, produced by processing <b>fondant</b> with invertase. [...] <b>Fondant</b> fancies are a type of cake typically coated in poured <b>fondant.</b>|$|R
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of <b>fondant</b> icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the <b>fondant,</b> and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. <b>Fondant</b> eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The <b>fondant</b> is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fondant,</b> {{also known}} as sugar paste or ready roll icing, exists in many {{different}} colors, and it is usually easy to handle once prepared properly. It must be rolled out with cornstarch to avoid sticking to any surface and to smooth it out. Once completely smooth and thin enough, cake decorators are able to mold <b>fondant</b> into many different artistic expressions. Many of these expressions are also taught in professional cake decorating classes. <b>Fondant</b> is primarily used to cover cakes, {{but it is also}} used to create individual show pieces for cakes.|$|R
