500|$|By early 1887, 13 African Americans {{were playing}} in the [...] "white" [...] minor leagues, {{including}} four in the Ohio State League. [...] Weldy began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. [...] However, he appeared in only four games for the Acorns. During the 1887 season, racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor leagues. [...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete." [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:The law is a disgrace to the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio– the voice of the people– that say all men are equal. I would suggest that your honorable body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground... There should be some broader cause– such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence– for barring a player, rather than his color. [...] It is for these reasons and because I think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and last– at all times and by everyone– <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> question again, 'Why was the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?' ...|$|E

With these sentiments, I invoke upon all the people of South Africa divine gifts of peace and prosperity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cézanne, {{progressively}} {{leading up}} to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was {{to arrive at a}} [...] "lived perspective" [...] by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "touch" [...] became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: [...] "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> understanding to organize into a painting." [...] The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. [...] "Nor was he satisfied," [...] writes Merleau-Ponty, [...] "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".|$|E

[...] We have a duty to pose overtly and without delay the problem of liquidating this miserable ghetto that is currently forming itself. It is time to ask: What do we do with them? Because to leave them free to multiply like rabbits, to consume our goods, to hate us and produce nothing in return, that cannot be. In Legionary Romania {{there is no room for}} drones. [...] It would serve Jews to know that we are not the passive bearers of a social rot, but the national surgeons of a national cancer. Hence I ask our own: what do we do with them? And <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Jews to reply honestly: what do you do?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning on 20 April, al-Khawaja refused all fluids, {{including}} {{water and}} intravenous saline. He {{asked to see}} his lawyer to write a will, but was denied access for the fourth week. So he begged his wife to pass on three things: that he was completely convinced as to the rightness of his action and, could he go back, would choose the same path again; his appeal that no one attempt a similar strike to the death; and finally, [...] "If I die, in the next 24 hrs, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> people to continue {{on the path of}} peaceful resistance... I don't want anybody to be hurt in my name." [...] On 25 April (his 77th day of hunger strike), his wife learned he had disappeared from his hospital bed. Both the Ministry of Interior and the Bahrain Defense Force hospital refused information as to his whereabouts or treatment. On 29 April, it emerged that he had been drugged, tied to a bed, and forcibly fed with a nasoenteric tube. Al-Khawaja considered the force feeding and the solitary confinement to be torture; he gave the doctor's name as Dr Ebrahim Zuwayed, declared he will hold him, the hospital and the Ministry of Interior responsible, and that he was continuing with his hunger strike.|$|E

2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and drug addict, served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at Florida State Prison for aggravated assault and battery stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident. [...] He was released on May 6, 2006, a week after her elimination from Idol. In an April 2006 interview with NBC Pickler said, [...] "One thing that's so important in life is we learn to forgive others. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Lord every day to forgive me for my sins and for things that I've done wrong. And who am I to not forgive someone for what they've done?" ..."God tells us to love everyone." ...|$|E
