5|$|Jordan's {{military}} industry thrived {{after the}} <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) defence company {{was established by}} <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> II in 1999, to provide an indigenous capability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the Jordanian Armed Forces, and to become a global hub in security research and development. It manufactures all types of military products, {{many of which are}} presented at the bi-annually held international military exhibition SOFEX. In 2015, KADDB exported $72 million worth of industries to over 42 countries.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1951, <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> I {{was shot}} three times by a Palestinian gunman {{as he entered}} the mosque, killing him. His {{grandson}} Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Obama {{traveled}} to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, {{following the death}} of <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah.</b> She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so, though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E
5|$|The current Saudi {{court system}} {{was created by}} King Abdul Aziz, who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and was {{introduced}} to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960. It comprises general and summary Sharia courts, with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations. Trials in Saudi Arabia are bench trials. Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah,</b> in 2007, introduced a number of significant judicial reforms, although they are yet to be fully implemented.|$|E
5|$|Amman has {{a mostly}} Sunni Muslim population, {{and the city}} {{contains}} numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-coloured walls and Persian carpets. It was built by a Circassian resident of Amman. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.|$|E
5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah.</b> Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to topple the French authorities in Syria and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz. The Hashemites were driven out of the latter in 1925 by the Saudis.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} <b>king,</b> <b>Abdullah</b> I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah.</b> Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{frequent}} bus connections to {{other cities in}} Jordan, {{as well as to}} major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.|$|E
5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's electrical consumption with renewable resources by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E
5|$|King Felipe VI of Spain, <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> II of Jordan, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud of the Saudi Arabia royal family, and Prince Pavlos of Greece and Denmark {{are among}} the royals who {{attended}} Georgetown. Besides numerous members of the senior diplomatic corps, graduates have also headed military organizations on both the domestic and international level, such as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones. Notable alumni in business include Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Patricia Russo, former Alcatel-Lucent CEO, William J. Doyle of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, and Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics franchises and former America Online executive. Leonsis is among four other undergraduate alumni who own professional sports teams, making Georgetown the most popular undergraduate university for major North American sports franchise owners. Actor Bradley Cooper, People Magazines Sexiest Man Alive 2011, is also a graduate of Georgetown and its English program. Actors/comedians Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jim Gaffigan, and Mike Birbiglia are also graduates of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle, {{part of the}} Occupied Royal Palaces Estate, {{is owned}} by Queen ElizabethII in right of the Crown, and day-to-day {{management}} is by the Royal Household. In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle {{in the world and}} the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, <b>King</b> <b>Abdullah</b> II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel. While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis. The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.|$|E
