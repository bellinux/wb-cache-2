25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated {{to be the very}} first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E

500|$|Scarponi, {{as well as}} John Gadret, {{the rider}} {{elevated}} onto the podium now in third place overall, both expressed sympathy for Contador and the feeling that being awarded these prestigious results {{in a court of}} law nearly a year after the race concluded kept them from feeling as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would were they attained on the road. Both Scarponi's overall championship and Gadret's podium finish constituted the first such results for either of them in a Grand Tour. Gadret, who had supported Contador's presence in the Giro peloton when the race began, reconsidered his position in hindsight, saying the Spaniard's attendance irrevocably changed the race. Further reactions from other personalities within the sport toward the ruling and the case itself were near universally negative. WADA celebrated the decision, calling the court [...] "robust and thorough" [...] in its jurisprudence of the World-Anti Doping Code.|$|E

500|$|They had {{problems}} during sequencing {{and had to}} repair the songs, taking some time. Pettibone had to keep things moving {{as fast as possible}} as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. At this point, as far as the music went, it was getting a little melancholy. However, as Pettibone explained, Madonna's stories directed the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory as they were more serious and intense. Madonna left the album's production to work on her next film Body of Evidence in Oregon. Shortly after, Pettibone started on a song called [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", which was not working. He further commented that he made a new bass line for the track. When Madonna went to record her vocals for [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", she started singing Little Willie John's song [...] "Fever" [...] instead of singing the original words. They decided to record it, as they felt it sounded <b>good.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> did not know the words, Madonna called Seymour Stein from Sire Records, and within an hour, they had the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song. This song was the last to be recorded for the album, in August 1992, and it was finished within a month later.|$|E

IGN's Colin Moriarty argued the game as a major improvement over the original Mega Man and that it even surpasses the critically acclaimed Mega Man 2 in quality. Moriarty justified this claim with the third installment's attempt at better storytelling, its longer length than any other classic Mega Man game, and its inclusion of all eight Mega Man 2 Robot Masters {{in addition to its}} own.

500|$|Onions {{are best}} {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{are low in}} sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require {{a high level of}} nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as [...] "long-day" [...] onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as [...] "intermediate-day" [...] types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, [...] "short-day" [...] onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3to9. Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to [...] "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.|$|E

[...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> ever have, and several tracks rank among their best."
