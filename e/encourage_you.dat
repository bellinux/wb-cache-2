2500|$|Due to his {{training}} in three Japanese lineages, Maezumi employed both Rinzai kōan study and Sōtō shikantaza in his teaching curriculum—an approach developed by his teacher Hakuun Yasutani. He {{was known to}} be especially strict about the posture of his students while sitting zazen. Maezumi used a range of kōans from different Zen traditions, including the Blue Cliff Record, The Gateless Gate, Transmission of the Lamp, and the Book of Equanimity.

2500|$|The {{film was}} labeled [...] "crude and tasteless" [...] {{by members of}} Japanese {{parliament}} and other government officials after the film was screened for them before its general release. The film created a debate over government action on media violence. At one point, director Kinji Fukasaku allegedly gave a press statement directed at {{the age group of}} the film's characters, saying [...] "you can sneak in, and I <b>encourage</b> <b>you</b> to do so." [...] Many conservative politicians used the film to blame popular culture for a youth crime wave. Ilya Garger of TIME magazine said that Battle Royale received [...] "free publicity" [...] and received [...] "box-office success usually reserved for cartoons and TV-drama spin-offs." [...] The Japanese reaction to the film in the early 2000s has been compared to the British outrage over A Clockwork Orange in the early 1970s. Critics note the relation of Battle Royale to the increasingly extreme trend in Asian cinema and its similarity to reality television.|$|E
