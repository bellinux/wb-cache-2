5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and <b>extendible</b> aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain <b>extendible</b> claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal's two <b>extendible</b> gangways, {{designed}} specifically for the building are listed as items of state heritage significance in New South Wales, independently of the main terminal structure. These structures are unique and were specifically designed for use at the OPT. In its original state, there were five of these <b>extendible</b> gangways attached to the terminal. During the 1988 refurbishment two of these <b>extendible</b> gangways were removed and relocated to the Wharf 13 at Pyrmont and Wharf 10 at Darling Harbour.|$|E

25|$|On systems {{where the}} floor {{level of the}} vehicle and the {{platform}} height closely match, an <b>extendible</b> step can be installed below {{the doors of the}} vehicle that deploy when the doors are unlocked. This significantly decreases the gap and thus the risks, while at the most vulnerable situation, boarding and alighting of vehicles at stations or stops. This method is used by the German BR423 EMU's and its derivatives, including the Dutch variant SLT.|$|E
500|$|Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach {{themselves}} to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of keratin and proteins. They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks (Buccinidae) and murex snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells, although many Busyconine whelks (e.g., Busycon sinistrum, Busycon carica) are [...] "chipping-style" [...] predators. The dog whelk (Nucella lamellosa) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The dog whelk then inserts its <b>extendible</b> proboscis and sucks out the body {{contents of the}} victim, which is typically a blue mussel. The whelk needs {{a few hours to}} penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in.|$|E

She befriends Wendy Marvell, who joins Lamia Scale and partners with her after Fairy Tail disbands.|$|E
6000|$|Spurzheim {{is a good}} man, and I like him; but he is dense, and {{the most}} ignorant German I ever knew. If he had been content with stating certain {{remarkable}} coincidences between the moral qualities and {{the configuration of the}} skull, it would have been well; but when he began to map out the cranium dogmatically, he fell into infinite absurdities. You know that every intellectual act, however you may distinguish it by name in respect of the originating faculties, is truly the act of the entire man; the notion of distinct material organs, therefore, in the brain itself, is plainly absurd. Pressed by this, Spurzheim has, at length, been guilty of some sheer quackery; and ventures to say that he has actually discovered a different material in the different parts or organs of the brain, so that he can tell a piece of benevolence from a bit of destructiveness, and so forth. Observe, also, that it is constantly found, that so far from there being a concavity in the interior surface of the cranium answering to the convexity apparent on the exterior--the interior is convex too. Dr. Baillie thought there was something in the system, because the notion of the brain being an <b>extendible</b> net helped to explain those cases where the intellect remained after the solid substance of the brain was dissolved in water.[1] ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Extendible</b> bond (or {{extendable}} bond) is {{a complex}} bond with the embedded option for a holder to extend its maturity date {{by a number of}} years. Such a bond may be considered as a portfolio of a straight, shorter-term bond and a call option to buy a longer-term bond.

50|$|<b>Extendible</b> notes {{guarantees}} {{are similar}} to full liquidity guarantees with the main difference being that the conduit issuer has the discretion to extend maturing commercial paper for a limited period of time (usually 60 days or less).

From the viewpoint of an outside investor, <b>extendible</b> notes guarantees are therefore riskier than full liquidity guarantees. This guarantee was used by weaker financial institutions and by conduits with higher quality assets.|$|E
