5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest <b>him</b> <b>are</b> Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with <b>him</b> <b>are</b> better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E

5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about <b>him</b> <b>are</b> {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} medieval period, Ælfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, {{perhaps because of}} the saint's {{connection}} with Cnut.
