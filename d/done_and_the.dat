5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cemetery continued to revert to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn's other accomplishments {{included}} {{establishing a}} state railroad commission and reorganizing the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College. Kentucky A had {{been separated from}} Kentucky University under Blackburn's predecessor, James B. McCreary; Blackburn now advocated that it be put {{under the control of}} and supported by the state. This was <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rechartered institution, located at Lexington, became known commonly as the State College; in 1916, it was renamed the University of Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should {{have the option to}} request a change of venue to Harrison County at that time. Miles from the scene of the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E

When he is <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E
5|$|Stalingrads formal keel-laying was on 31 December 1951 and it {{was hoped}} that she could be {{launched}} on 6 November 1953, the eve of the 36th anniversary of the October Revolution. But deliveries of steel, armor, machinery and other equipment were delayed or arrived out of sequence, despite extraordinary efforts by the Ministry of Shipbuilding, and slowed construction enough so that she fell about six months behind schedule and the same was more or less true for the other ships. By 1 January 1953 Stalingrad was intended to be 42.9% complete, but was actually only 18.8% done. Moskva was planned to be 11.5% finished, but was only 7.5% <b>done.</b> <b>And</b> <b>the</b> unnamed ship was intended to be 5.2% along, but was only 2.5% complete.|$|E
