5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt <b>deserved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taft made six {{appointments}} to the Supreme Court, {{the most of}} any president except George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The death of Justice Rufus Peckham in October 1909 gave Taft his first opportunity. He chose an old friend and colleague from the Sixth Circuit, Horace H. Lurton of Georgia; he had in vain urged Theodore Roosevelt to appoint Lurton to the high court. Attorney General Wickersham objected that Lurton, a former Confederate soldier and a Democrat, was aged 65. Taft named Lurton anyway on December 13, 1909, and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote a week later. Lurton is still the oldest person to be made an associate justice. Lurie suggested that Taft, already beset by the tariff and conservation controversies, desired to perform an official act which gave him pleasure, especially since he thought Lurton <b>deserved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|When Schmeling faced Mickey Walker, {{the future}} hall-of-famer who had {{recently}} held Sharkey to a draw that many felt Walker <b>deserved,</b> <b>it</b> was thought that this fight was for the real heavyweight championship. Walker, a former welterweight, was a popular slugger who had won championships in two divisions but was at a considerable size disadvantage against the European. Though Walker took the lead on points, Schmeling dealt out a beating as the fight progressed. After eight rounds, Walker's corner threw in the towel, confirming Schmeling's status as the leading heavyweight in the world.|$|E

25|$|Jarrett {{returned}} to TNA on the June 24, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling, alongside his wife Karen Jarrett; Jarrett {{announced that he}} was part of the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary XIII, while also promoting his new promotion Global Force Wrestling (GFW). Jarrett would win his record third King of the Mountain match, thus capturing the newly reactivated and renamed TNA King of the Mountain Championship on June 28 stating that he would be taking the belt to GFW. On August 12, Jarrett was appointed Impact Wrestlings new authority figure by TNA President Dixie Carter after General Manager Bully Ray was attacked, which led to Jarrett vacating the King of the Mountain Championship. The week after, it was revealed that Karen Jarrett orchestrated the attacks on Bully Ray and Drew Galloway, claiming that TNA was his company and that he <b>deserved</b> <b>it.</b> Jarrett turned his back on Carter, choosing to align with his wife and turning heel in the process. On the September 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, Carter made a challenge to Jarrett, putting her TNA shares up against his for full control of the company, by setting up a 10-man tag team match. It was later reported that Jarrett had sold his minority stake to Panda Energy. On the September 16 edition of Impact Wrestling, Team TNA (Galloway, Lashley, Eddie Edwards, Bram and Davey Richards) defeated Team GFW (Sonjay Dutt, Jeff Jarrett, Eric Young, Chris Mordetzky and Brian Myers) in a Lethal Lockdown Match, resulting in Dixie gaining possession of Jarrett's TNA stake and, as a result, full control of TNA.|$|E

The conditions for the medal have been changed several times; in 1736, it was suggested that [...] "a medal or other honorary prize should be bestowed on the person whose experiment should be best approved", and this remained the rule until 1831, when the conditions were changed so that the medal would be awarded to the researcher that the Royal Society Council decided most <b>deserved</b> <b>it.</b> A second donation of £1666 13s. 4d. was made by Sir Joseph William Copley in 1881, and the interest from that amount is used to pay for the medal. The medal in its current format is made of silver gilt and awarded with a £5000 prize.|$|E
500|$|There was {{an attempt}} made to claim the flitch on 12 June 1772 by John and Susan Gilder. [...] The couple had given due notice of their claim and were {{accompanied}} by a large crowd of onlookers. [...] However, {{the lord of the}} manor had ordered that the ceremony should not take place and the gates of the priory were nailed shut to prevent it. [...] By 1809 the tradition was definitely abolished. [...] A further attempt to claim the flitch was made in 1832 by Josiah Vine, a retired cheesemaker, who travelled with his wife from Reading to make his claim. [...] He too was refused a trial by a very unsympathetic Steward of Little Dunmow. [...] John Bull on 8 October 1837 reported that it had been revived by the Saffron Walden and Dunmow Agricultural Society. [...] Apparently however, this flitch was merely distributed at the annual society dinner. [...] In 1851 a couple from Felstead were also refused a trial at the Priory, but obtained a flitch from the people of nearby Great Dunmow who felt that they <b>deserved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she <b>deserved</b> <b>it</b> for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E

The reviewer wrote, [...] "This film {{story has been}} done before and by an Independent producer, which prompts the wonder if the Independents would not do well to avoid borrowing - at least from each other. The Thanhouser producers have the excuse, however, {{in this particular case}} that the former telling of the story was a sad failure, while this one has pleasing qualities. Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other, but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure, whereat the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love, and the perverse youngsters at once elope, assisted secretly by the parents. The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy." [...] The Moving Picture World was more brief, acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing. The Moving Picture News review was also brief, stating, [...] "The film calls for shrieks of laughter; it <b>deserved</b> <b>it,</b> for it is built upon human nature. A story anyone can see and enjoy." [...] In 1912, the American Film Manufacturing Company released the similarly titled An Assisted Elopement and the Selig Polyscope Company released its own An Assisted Elopement.|$|E
