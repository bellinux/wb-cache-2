5|$|Although hot {{chocolate}} is generally consumed for pleasure, the beverage confers several potential health benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, {{hot chocolate}} was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
40|$|Causal {{relations}} can themselves {{take part}} in causal relations.

50|$|The {{roots of}} plant {{communities}} {{to varying degrees}} help hold soil together by creating a network of roots that trap soil within. This in turn <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> soil erosion, stabilizes slopes and <b>prevent</b> landslides, <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> desertification in vulnerable areas, and controls pollution into waterways by acting as part of riparian buffers.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge {{and to allow}} for dedicated local traffic and bridge traffic lanes. The lane configuration changes confused drivers in the area, especially motorists with outdated GPS devices; because of this, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.

5|$|Razor Ramon {{had been}} feuding with Shawn Michaels since being pushed {{to win the}} WWF Intercontinental Championship in late 1993.

5|$|Some older {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a subsequent meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity may <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> vasospasm their use does not appear to change outcomes.|$|E

5|$|The {{consumption}} of parsnips has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips may <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E

They can also <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Both {{lifestyle}} changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Flooding in the Niigata area {{continued}} even {{following the}} construction Ohkouzu Channel and another channel, which was originally planned in the Edo period (1700s-1800s), {{was built on}} the western outskirts of Niigata City to further mitigate the risk of flooding and to <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> saltwater intrusion into the Shinano estuary. The Sekiya Diversion Channel was originally to be funded by the Niigata Prefecture; however the 1964 Niigata earthquake resulted in the funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{eating a}} full diet that {{contains}} protein, fruits, vegetables, fat, and carbohydrates is important (several {{vitamins and minerals}} require fat {{in order to be}} delivered or absorbed by the body). Any deficiency will typically show first in the hair. A mild case of anemia can cause shedding and hair loss. Among others, the B group of vitamins are the most important for healthy hair, especially biotin. B5 (pantothenic acid) gives hair flexibility, strength and shine and <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> hair loss and graying. B6 <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> dandruff and can be found in cereals, egg yolk and liver. Vitamin B12 <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> the loss of hair and can be found in fish, eggs, chicken and milk.|$|R
