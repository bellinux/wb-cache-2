5000|$|These {{types of}} {{polymers}} {{have played a}} role in biomedical and robotic applications and liquid crystalline polymers. In 1974, R.B. Meyer predicted ferroelectricity in chiral smectic liquid crystals by pure symmetry conditions. Shortly after, Clark and Lagerwall had done work on the fast <b>electrooptic</b> effect in a surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) structure. This opened up promising possibility of technical applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals in high-information display devices. Through applied research, it was shown that SSFLC structure has faster switching times and bistability behavior in comparison with commonly used nematic liquid crystal displays. In the same time period, the first side-chain liquid crystalline polymers (SCLCP) were synthesized. These comb-like polymers has mesogenic side chains that are covalently bonded (via flexible spacer units) to the polymer backbone. The most important feature of the SCLCP's is their glassy state. In other words, these polymers have a [...] "frozen" [...] ordered state along one axis when cooled below their glass transition temperature. This is advantageous for research in the area of nonlinear optical and optical data storage devices. The disadvantage is that these SCLCP's suffered from their slow switching times due to their high rotational viscosity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} years, several optical {{potential}} transformers (OPT) {{have been developed}} and applied to perform high-voltage measurements in electrical power systems. Such devices offer very attractive advantages, compared to conventional transformers, such as, fast transitory response, low susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, high signal/noise ratio, reduced size and weight, and provide complete electric isolation between high-voltage system and measurement equipment. A {{very important part of}} an OPT is the high-voltage optical sensor, which is usually based on an <b>electrooptic</b> sensor. The design of high-voltage <b>electrooptic</b> sensors is a difficult task, often demanding aid of electromagnetic simulation tools to be precisely done. This work illustrates the effect of different crystal sizes on the performance of a multi-segmented <b>electrooptic</b> sensor with several pieces of <b>electrooptic</b> crystals and with single <b>electrooptic</b> crystal in longitudinal configuration. The electric field is computed by applying a 2 D Finite Element Method (FEM) exploiting the geometric axial symmetry presented by the sensor. The method allows evaluation of the Vπ voltage, which is related to the dynamic range and is often used as a figure of merit for the <b>electrooptic</b> sensor. A fine adjustment of Vπ voltage for a given application can be obtained by choosing carefully the type, number, shape, and position of <b>electrooptic</b> crystals.

40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of phase, intensity, and contrast effects during <b>electrooptic</b> modulation is theoretically and exper- imentally investigated.
