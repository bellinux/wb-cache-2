40|$|The {{theory of}} {{evolution}} links random variation and selection to incremental adaptation. In a different intellectual domain, learning theory links incremental adaptation (e. g., from positive and/or negative reinforcement) to intelligent behaviour. Specifically, learning theory explains how incremental adaptation can acquire knowledge from past experience {{and use it to}} direct future behaviours toward favourable outcomes. Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the ‘uninformed’ process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles – the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation,</b> and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of variation, selection and inheritance, on which evolution {{by natural selection}} depends, are not fixed over evolutionary time. Current evolutionary biology is increasingly focussed on understanding how the evolution of developmental organisations modifies the distribution of phenotypic variation, the evolution of ecological relationships modifies the selective environment, {{and the evolution of}} reproductive relationships modifies the heritability of the evolutionary unit. The major transitions in evolution, in particular, involve radical changes in developmental, <b>ecological</b> and reproductive <b>organisations</b> that instantiate variation, selection and inheritance at a higher level of biological organisation. However, current evolutionary theory is poorly equipped to describe how these organisations change over evolutionary time and especially how that results in adaptive complexes at successive scales of organisation (the key problem is that evolution is self-referential, i. e. the products of evolution change the parameters of the evolutionary process). Here we first reinterpret the central open questions in these domains from a perspective that emphasises the common underlying themes. We then synthesise the findings from a developing body of work that is building a new theoretical approach to these questions by converting well-understood theory and results from models of cognitive learning. Specifically, connectionist models of memory and learning demonstrate how simple incremental mechanisms, adjusting the relationships between individually-simple components, can produce organisations that exhibit complex system-level behaviours and improve the adaptive capabilities of the system. We use the term “evolutionary connectionism” to recognise that, by functionally equivalent processes, natural selection acting on the relationships within and between evolutionary entities can result in organisations that produce complex system-level behaviours in evolutionary systems and modify the adaptive capabilities of natural selection over time. We review the evidence supporting the functional equivalences between the domains of learning and of evolution, and discuss the potential for this to resolve conceptual problems in our understanding of the evolution of developmental, <b>ecological</b> and reproductive <b>organisations</b> and, in particular, the major evolutionary transition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{this work}} is to {{study the effects of}} {{different}} individual behaviours on the overall growth of a spatially distributed population. The population can grow on two spatial patches, a source and a sink, that are connected by migrations. Two time scales are involved in the dynamics, a fast one corresponding to migrations and a slow one associated with the local growth on each patch. Different scenarios of density-dependent migration are proposed and their effects on the population growth are investigated. A general discussion on the use of aggregation methods for the study of integration of different ecological levels is proposed. © 2000 Académie des sciences/ Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS aggregation methods / slow–fast dynamics / spatially distributed population / density dependent migrations / <b>ecological</b> levels of <b>organisation</b> Résumé – Émergence du comportement individuel au niveau de la population.

The ideology of these relationships is shown to turn on the ritual correction of sexual asymmetry in the name of an ideal of mirrored symmetry (yanantin). The analysis is reinforced by the introduction of lexical material from XVIth century Quechua dictionaries, which suggests the pan-Andean importance of this concept, and its usefulness for the interpretation of widely varied Andean meaning-systems, from weaving and ceramic designs to sculptural and architectural complexes. Finally, its function in disguising real inequalities between the sexes is related to the function of other compounds of yana- which similarly clothe relationships of class and domination in the language of "communal" reciprocity.

40|$|Background: Program {{theory can}} provide reviewers with a {{structured}} approach for outlining the action model(s) (i. e., characteristics of implementer, implementing system, <b>ecological</b> context, partnering <b>organisations,</b> participants, intervention), change model(s) describing the intended sequence of proximal to distal outcomes in participants, and identifying relevant process evaluation variables (i. e., fidelity, dose). Integrating this information can strengthen attributions of effectiveness and inform knowledge translation. Objectives: To assess {{the extent to}} which and how reviewers account for aspects of the action model, process evaluation measures and change model(s) underpinning their reviews. Methods: 27 systematic effectiveness reviews on social welfare, criminal justice and education published by the Campbell Collaboration (some co-registered with Cochrane) with reported outcomes on children or youth were reviewed. An assessment tool, informed by a program theory approach, was developed to assess elements of the action model, change model and process evaluation measures within reviews. Two raters completed extractions using a 7 -point rating scale and noting comments in EPPI-Reviewer Version 4. 0. Results: Within the action model, the majority of reviews accounted for one or more aspects of the intervention (i. e., format) and participant characteristics with aspects of the implementing organisation, implementer and partnerships considered less often. Overall, action models could have been more clearly defined. Intervention dose was the most common process evaluation measure. For the change model, most reviews were “black box” with change processes remaining undifferentiated. Reviewers expressed interest in identifying active ingredients of interventions and integrating qualitative evidence. This presentation will feature exemplars to illustrate how program theory can be integrated into reviews to understand heterogeneity. Conclusions: Program theory can add value to reviews by informing the review objectives, inclusion/ exclusion criteria, search strategies, and the operationalisation/ analysis of variables related to the action model(s), change model(s) and process evaluation. Resources, training, and guidance are needed to support reviewers. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} awareness of {{the deterioration of the}} biophysical environment and change in ecological values are affecting the relationship of organizations with the biophysical environment. The management of green issues has been peripheral to organizations' business strategy and dealt with in a piecemeal manner. However, organizations are recognising the strategic importance of the management of green issues and are introducing internal environmental management systems to deal with such issues. The management of green issues has to be dealt with by most organizations, and virtually all industrial organizations. In this work an 'ecological complex framework' has been developed in order to systematically investigate and represent the social process associated with ecological forces and environmental controls affecting the relationship of organizations with the biophysical environment. The aim of the framework developed in this work is first to understand how and what green issues are noticed by organizations and how they respond to them. Second to bring green issues into strategic management research. To allow a coherent investigation of this issue this work has concentrated on one specific industry, the oil industry, with special focus on the refining activity. A case study of the Brazilian oil organization Petrobras was undertaken to investigate the problem. In this case study representatives of Petrobras were interviewed about their roles in the management of green issues. These representatives ranged from operational staff through to senior management at refineries and head office. In addition to the case study environmental managers from other oil organizations in the UK were interviewed and a content analysis of corporate literature of all oil organizations studied was undertaken. The findings of this investigation have shown that the management of green issues have become an important issue in oil refineries' strategies. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of stakeholders' <b>ecological</b> demands, oil <b>organisations</b> are still learning how to recognise their relevance and strategic implications. ...|$|R

However, still {{little is known about}} the distribution of microbial communities and functions between soil aggregate size fractions in relation to land use. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the gene abundance of microbial communities related to the nitrogen cycle and potential greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in six soil aggregate sizes (0 - 0. 25, 0. 25 - 0. 5, 0. 5 - 1. 0, 1 - 2, 2 - 5, 5 - 10 mm) in four land uses (i. e. grassland, cropland, forest, young forest). Quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) was used to investigate the abundance of bacteria, archaea and fungi, and functional guilds involved in N-fixation (nifH gene), nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes) and denitrification (narG, nirS, and nosZ genes). Land use leads to significantly different abundances for all genes analysed, with the cropland site showing the lowest abundance for all genes except amoA bacteria and archaea. In contrast, not a single land use consistently showed the highest gene abundance for all the genes investigated. Variation in gene abundance between aggregate size classes was also found, but the patterns were gene specific and without common trends across land uses. However, aggregates within the size class of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm showed high bacterial 16 S, nifH, amoA bacteria, narG, nirS and nosZ gene abundance for the two forest sites but not for fungal ITS and archaeal 16 S. The potential GHG fluxes were affected by land use but the effects were far less pronounced than for microbial gene abundance, inconsistent across land use and soil aggregates. However, few differences in GHG fluxes were found between soil aggregate sizes. From this study, land use emerges as the dominant factor that explains the distribution of N functional communities and potential GHG fluxes in soils, with less pronounced and less generalized effects of aggregate size...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{projected}} to increase the frequency and severity of extreme events, adding to the plethora of existing pressures that streams and rivers already face. Compound events such as drought may comprise numerous stressors that occur in concert to elicit ecological change. However the causal mechanisms of such impacts remain unknown, and research attempting to disentangle impacts of compound events, or link effects across levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation,</b> remains in its infancy. This research investigates impacts of key drought stressors –sedimentation, dewatering and warming – across multiple ecological, hierarchical levels. At the individual level, macroinvertebrates displayed differential thermal sensitivity to warming which may explain idiosyncratic ecological responses reported elsewhere, whilst sedimentation intensified predator-prey interactions. Mesocosms were effective tools for studying drought stressors independently and in combination at the community and functional level. Dewatering main effects reduced the density of a common taxon and functional feeding group biomass, whilst all three stressors sometimes interacted together in complex ways. Stressors also had quantifiable effects at the whole-system level, e. g. stream metabolism. This study provides initial findings pertaining to drought impact causative mechanisms across multiple levels of ecological complexity, highlighting the importance of an experimental approach to predict future effects of compound events...|$|E
40|$|Although {{combining}} datasets {{is often}} needed to unravel large-scale or long-term patterns in benthos ecology, this is frequently hampered by differences in technical {{design of the}} individual studies. One element that often vary among macrobenthic studies is the sieving procedure: sieving alive versus sieving after fixation. This study therefore aimed at the qualification and quantification {{of the impact of}} sieving procedure, using a 1  mm mesh sized sieve, at three levels of ecological organisation: (1) diversity, (2) species and taxon density, and (3) community structure. To include a maximum suite of macrobenthic species and to evaluate the community-specific effects, the impact of sieving procedure was investigated within four widely spread macrobenthos communities in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Sieving alive negatively impacted all tested diversity measures (S, N 1, N 2, N 8, H', E S 100 and J') : community-dependent relative losses of up to 35 % were observed. However, most trends were ambiguous and statistically non-significant. Community- and taxon-dependent impacts were detected at the level of density. Mainly polychaetes were found to be negatively impacted by sieving alive (relative losses maximum 81 %) : especially small, interstitial polychaetes (e. g. Hesionura elongata and Spio filicornis) tend to actively escape from the sieve (relative loss up to 100 %). Next to size, also behaviour, the presence of head appendages, the depth of the sampling stations and sampling season are believed to influence the sieving procedure impact. While detailed community composition was impacted (ANOSIM dissimilarity: maximum 85 %), no major impact on the differentiation between the investigated communities was detected. The present study thus demonstrated that combining data, retrieved with a different sieving procedure can be useful, but its reliability will mainly depend on the type of questions one wants to answer. In all cases caution at all levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation</b> is advised...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of the multinational oil giant Enron has lent new force to {{the debate about the}} way we run and regulate large organisations. Whether they are oil companies, social enterprises or hospital trusts, organisations play a powerful role in our lives – yet the formula for making them both accountable and efficient has proved elusive. While opinions still differ about the virtues of nationalisation, few would argue that privatisation has been an unqualified success. The search for a new model continues. In this NEF pocketbook, Shann Turnbull argues that the Enron debacle, and the failure of privatised entities such as Railtrack in the UK, are symptoms of a wider crisis in corporate governance. Top-down “command and control ” hierarchies, the organisational model which is virtually synonymous with capitalism in the English-speaking world, have outlived their usefulness. They cannot cope with complexity or human diversity, they cannot regulate themselves and their centralised power structures make them vulnerable to corruption. A new breed of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation</b> is needed, based on the way nature manages complexity, to decentralise decision-making, involve stakeholders in selfregulation and provide {{a way out of the}} sterile public-versus-private debate.

40|$|The {{premise that}} the {{continued}} existence of organisations in a democracy depends on both the tacit and the explicit approval and opinions of their many publics is fundamental to public relations theory. Furthermore, the challenge of coping with the potential constraints and opportunities of public opinion as an aspect of the organisational environment is essential to contemporary public relations practice. While the term "public opinion environment" appears intermittently in scholarly and trade publications, the dimensions and characteristics of this aspect of organisational environments remain largely unspecified. This thesis explores two challenges [...] the first is to conceptualise and measure variation in an important aspect of contemporary organisational environments, the public opinion environment, and the second is to investigate the influence of that environment on the critical and often highly exposed relationships between organisations and activist publics. In suggesting a relationship between variation in the environment and the evolutionary pathways of organisational relationships, the perspective underpinning this thesis is both ecological and evolutionary. <b>Ecological</b> analyses of <b>organisations</b> assume that members of a population are affected similarly by environmental change and share a common dependence on the material and social environment. Consistent with this perspective, this thesis explores the public opinion environment and the organisation-activist relationships therein longitudinally at the population level of analysis. The focal organisational population is Australia's major banks, and the period of interest extends from 1981 to 2001. An evolutionary model of organisation-activist relationships (EOAR) is developed, and the propositions derived from this model are explored using a comparative case study approach. These propositions anticipate and specify associations between variations in dimensions of the public opinion environment of an organisational population and the evolution of organisation-activist relationships in the population. Central to understanding the public opinion environment of an organisational population are the issues around which activist publics organise, public opinion develops, and organisation-activist relationships emerge. Then, the public opinion environment is conceptualised as a set of issues that concern Australia's major banks and their publics. Variations in this "issue set," are described using four dimensions: stability (turnover of issues), complexity (the number of issues in the issue set), intensity (volume of media coverage), and direction (favourability of media coverage for the focal population). To explore the propositions of the EOAR model, I have analysed the variations in these four dimensions in relation to the evolution of organisation-activist relationships. To observe and describe this evolution, I have located the state of these relationships on a conflict continuum using relationship-signalling statements made by organisations and activists and published by the media. Three cases studies from the same organisational population, Australia's major banks, are compared over three different but consecutive seven-year periods from 1981 to 2001. The case studies involved the extensive review of industry reports, submissions and other documents from several government inquiries, and scholarly articles, as well as the content analysis of more than 6, 500 newspaper articles published during each of the three case study periods. The findings of this comparative case study suggest that variations in some dimensions of the public opinion environment of an organisational population are associated with the evolutionary ecology of organisation-activist relationships in that population. However, the associations are more complex than was anticipated by the original propositions of the EOAR model; thus refinements to the model are advanced for further investigation. A primary contribution {{of this study is that}} it provides the theoretical apparatus and tools to systematically explore, interpret, and measure variation in the issues comprising the public opinion environment and to track the evolving organisation-activist relationships organised around those issues. Because the population level of analysis and a longitudinal lens are applied, this conceptualisation of the public opinion environment effectively captures and specifies the overlapping and persistent nature of issues. The evidence of this study suggests that when issues have emerged in the public opinion environment at the population level of analysis, they are likely to persist as a hub around which publics organise, providing a focus for discussions and debates for years to come. This persistence, "issue-set inertia," has important implications for organisational relationships. Given these conditions, organisations can monitor and manage their responses to issues. However, it is naïvely optimistic at best to accept the contention of issues management consultants and other pundits that organisations can manage the issues themselves. Furthermore, the findings of this study call into question the value of advice that encourages organisations to deal with issues by seeking to avoid engaging with their activist publics and by downplaying the issues in the media...|$|R
40|$|Food webs, the {{graphical}} {{depictions of}} feeding interactions between species, have long fascinated ecologist. They now occupy {{a key role}} in ecological science due to the unique perspective on the staggering complexity of natural systems that they provide. There have been several attempts at developing theories to explain the structural properties of these ecological networks, which have met with relatively good success. However, we are as yet lacking a mechanistic understanding of the processes that structure food webs. Recently, in an attempt to address this, the focus of food web studies has shifted {{to the role of the}} individual consumer and whether we can scale from our understanding of foraging behaviour to predict the structural and dynamical properties of food webs. As a result of this there has arisen a need for individual based models and empirical datasets to provide us with a firm foundation to scale across levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation.</b> In this thesis I demonstrate, using a mathematical model, how the foraging behavior at the level of individuals can provide us with novel and useful insights into the causes and consequences of patterns in food webs structure. I also present results analyzing a novel individual based data set to survey and enrich these links across levels of organization. My findings strongly suggest that understanding the variation of size structure among ecological networks requires knowledge about the causes of variation in individual foraging behaviour. Other work included in this thesis demonstrates both how modelling foraging behaviour of individuals and its effects on food web topology alters our expectations about the likely consequences of extinctions in food webs. And finally how insights gained from modelling individual based foraging can enable us to build theoretical tools to compensate for the sampling effects that have dogged food web data sets.

The aim of this thesis is to improve understanding how local-scale interactions of individuals unite to drive and stabilise patterns at higher levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation,</b> and to determine what role the physical environment plays. Using an approach that combines meta-analysis of published data, ecoinformatics, and mechanistic theory, this thesis explores how the physical environment drives universality and variation in ecological systems. I begin in Chapter 1 with a brief overview of ecological systems and approaches to identifying, studying and understanding mechanisms that determine their organisation. Ecological communities are the framework within which life operates, while individuals and their interactions with each other and the physical environment are the fundamental building blocks of communities. Consumer–resource interactions are especially important because they determine energy flow between individuals, and fluxes and stability in communities. The physical environment can have profound effects on <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation,</b> at the local scale (e. g., species interactions) and on entire systems (e. g., body size and abundance distribution, food web architecture). Together, these factors demand a functional approach, which explicitly links mechanisms acting across multiple levels of organisation, to understanding ecological systems and their dependence on the physical environment. Environmental temperature has strong and systematic effects on biological processes at all levels of organisation, ranging from cells to ecosystems, so it is surprising that {{little is known about the}} general mechanisms by which temperature affects biological systems. In Chapter 2 I present a dataset on how diverse biological rates and times respond to temperature, which I then analyse in two subsequent chapters to aid in the search for general mechanisms of thermal dependence. For nearly a century, intraspecific studies (within single species' populations) of thermal responses have been conducted on a wide range of organismal traits. Comparative studies of these data are essential for elucidating mechanisms underlying thermal response curves. However, such comparative intraspecific studies have been limited because of a lack of a comprehensive database that organizes these data with consistent units and trait definitions. I present a database of 2, 352 thermal responses for 220 traits for microbes, plants, and animals compiled from 270 published sources. This represents the most diverse and comprehensive thermal response dataset ever compiled. The traits in this database span levels of biological organisation from internal physiology to species interactions, and were measured in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats for 411 species. Although I include some physiological rates, most data are for ecological traits, which I define to mean any organismal trait that directly determines interactions between individuals within or between species. Analyses of this dataset should provide new insights into generalities and deviations in the thermal dependence of biological traits, and thus how biological systems, from cells to ecosystems, respond to temperature change. Such insights are essential for understanding how natural biological systems function, and for how life is responding to Earth's complex and rapidly changing thermal landscape. In Chapter 3 I analyse this database to understand patterns in the temperature dependence of physiological and ecological traits. After removal of data to only retain high quality thermal responses, I analyse responses ranging over 66 °C and representing 112 traits, 309 species, and spanning 15 orders of magnitude in body size. I analyse three components of the thermal response: the initial increase in the trait value with temperature (rise), its ultimate decrease at higher temperatures (fall), and the transition between the rise and fall components (unimodal). The diversity and number of traits, species, and habitats allows me to identify and quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. Analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87...|$|E

Consistent body size-related patterns, relevant to food webs, have been found at the individual (e. g. metabolism), population (e. g. predator-prey interactions), and community (e. g. body-size scaling with abundance) levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation.</b> These patterns represent key components of food webs, so body-size distributions should be representative {{of a wide range}} of food web processes. Therefore, knowledge on the controls of the distribution of body sizes within a community should aid in the understanding of community structure and stability. I focused on two key body size-associated relationships in food webs: the relationship between body mass/size (M) and abundance (N), and relationships between body size and predator-prey interaction strengths. Analysis of M-N data, collected from stream communities spanning habitat size and flooding disturbance gradients, indicated that habitat size limited top predator size, whereas disturbance limited their abundance. These results highlight how M-N relationships, and changes in body size patterns across communities in general, are particularly useful tools for understanding influences on community structure. Mesocosm experiments were used to investigate how relationships between predator-prey body mass ratios (PPMR) and predator-prey interaction strengths differed when prey defences and density varied. Larger predators generally had stronger per-capita interaction strengths however, prey morphological defences and prey abundance significantly altered the relationship between body size and per-capita interaction strengths. Defended prey were eaten less than undefended prey and the relationship between PPMR and interaction strength was steeper at higher prey densities. These results indicated that while PPMRs are generally good predictors of interaction strengths, the incorporation of other general traits, beyond body size, into current theory would improve prediction of interaction strengths in food webs. An in-stream channel experiment was conducted to investigate the population, compared to per-capita, effects of top-predator body size and abundance on the strength of top-down interactions in food webs. By manipulating top-predator size and abundance, but keeping top-predator (brown trout) biomass constant, I showed that smaller, more abundant top predators had greater top-down effects compared to, fewer large predators of equivalent biomass. Overall, my results indicate that body size-related relationships can be used to describe changes in predator-prey interaction strengths, community structure and by extension possibly community stability. However, the usefulness of these relationships could be improved by incorporating traits over and above body size, which would aid in the prediction of community stability as communities face ongoing anthropogenic pressures...|$|E
40|$|Headwater streams are {{important}} habitats, unique in their heterogeneity and biodiversity. {{they are considered}} significant for the functioning of whole river systems. Many headwater systems. {{such as those in}} the temperate and sub arctic northern hemisphere, drain peat dominated catchments, a habitat that is increasingly threatened by climate change, acidification and pressures from an array of land management practices. Together these impacts are resulting in the widespread degradation of peatlands and it is hypothesised that stressors could severely impact streams draining these systems, causing shifts in macro invertebrate community composition and alterations to functional process rates. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on the exact impacts of these stressors to peatland streams and, furthermore, limited knowledge of these ecosystems in their intact state. Thus, the overarching aim of this work is to improve understanding surrounding the impacts of stressors to peatland streams and to contextualise this research with an improved knowledge of the dynamics of intact peatland streams. This work focused on streams originating from blanket peats in the UK, which form important headwaters of many major UK rivers, and had four main objectives. 1) Develop a holistic understanding of an intact peatland stream through intensive assessment of physico chemistry, macroinvertebrate communities and three functional processes (algae accrual, plant litter decomposition and whole stream metabolism) using both a longitudinal survey and intense seasonal monitoring. 2) Assess the impacts of two catchment-scale drivers of change in peatland habitats (rotational heather burning and erosion) on stream ecosystems, examining physicochemistry, macroinvertebrates and ecosystem functioning across fifteen streams. 3) Examine gradients of sedimentation associated with environmental change and land management using streamside mesocosm and reach experiments. 4) Consider the mechanisms that elicit a change in physicochemisty, macroinvertebrates and ecosystem function by considering interrelationships and advancement of conceptual models. The interdisciplinary approach used in this thesis allowed a novel assessment of the spatiotemporal variability of peatland stream ecosystems and for the first time hig~lighted alterations in both macroinvertebrate communities and ecosystem functioning along the stream length and across seasons in an intact peatland stream. Increases in macroinvertebrate abundance, primary production and community vi j b respiration were observed with increasing distance downstream and with increasing catchment size. These parameters, along with algae accrual and leaf litter decomposition rates, also showed strong seasonal patterns, decreasing in winter and amplifying in summer. Variations in these parameters were driven predominantly by increases in temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), discharge and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Erosion, and to some degree rotational heather burning, were found to impact physicochemical variables, with total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and SSC displaying increased concentration. s in impacted catchments. Associated shifts were found in macroinvertebrate communities, with amplified abundance in eroded catchments driven by increases in ' more sediment tolerate taxa, such as Chironomidae and Oligo chaeta. Streams draining eroded and burnt catchments also displayed lower numbers of sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa. Functional parameters did not reflect these changes in chemistry and biota, but there were clear differences between the fifteen individual streams. Experiments undertaken in streamside mesocosms and stream reaches showed impacts of organic sedimentation across several levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation.</b> Increased benthic sedimentation led to declines in macroinvertebrate abundance, shifts in - species composition and increased sediment respiration rates. Short term influx of organic sediment in reach based experiments caused significant increases in the downstream drift of macroinvertebrates during nocturnal periods, however, these streams were quick to recover to pre-experiment drift rates and benthic communities were not affected over the period of the experiment. These influx events produced a rapid and severe decline in GPP measured though whole stream metabolism rates, This body of research highlights peatland streams as unique and heterogenic systems but also as systems that are sensitive to anthropogenic stressors at both the catchment and reach scale, These habitats have intrinsic importance, supporting diverse macroinvertebrate communities, are significant for the modulation of carbon and are good indicators of the condition of the surrounding catchment. Thus, this work emphasises the need for restorative measures and sustainable management in peatland habitats that considers the streams they support. In addition, this work furthers knowledge of the baseline conditions in these systems and increases understanding of the use of functional processes as ecological indicators in peatland [...] streams.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of native forests to pastures and crops {{is one of}} the most extensive causes of deforestation worldwide. Concomitant with agricultural landscape modification are the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, which are major causes of species’ extinctions, population declines and altered ecosystem functions. However, in many tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions, abandoned agricultural lands are reverting to regrowth or secondary forest, which represents an important opportunity for passive landscape restoration. Regrowth may be particularly important in highly modified landscapes, where the area of mature forest may be insufficient to support viable plant and animal communities without some form of restoration. Some studies of fauna populations in regrowth forest have found recovery of species richness within several decades, although recovery of species composition may take at least 100 years and some species may be permanently lost. While these findings are encouraging, they generally fail to account for the landscape context in which regrowth occurs and focus mainly on tropical forests. The aim of this thesis was to advance the understanding of fauna recovery in regrowth forests on abandoned agricultural land by: i) comparing woodland bird communities in a replicated chronosequence of semi-arid sub-tropical regrowth forests; and ii) quantifying how the ecological values of regrowth habitat vary among stand-, patch- and landscape-levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>organisation.</b> A review of 68 studies of fauna recovery in regrowth forests, revealed that current knowledge is limited by the predominance of studies conducted: in tropical rainforests; with minimal replication of sites; in landscapes within proximity of large tracts of relatively undisturbed mature forests; and with limited consideration of the influence of the spatial context on fauna recovery in regrowth forest. This study makes a significant contribution to understanding fauna recovery in regrowth forests by quantifying the recovery of estimated bird species richness to levels similar to mature forest, within a period of 30 - 60 years, in highly modified semi-arid agricultural landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. An ordination of the similarity in species composition among forest types also suggested that after 30 - 60 years regrowth bird communities are more similar to mature brigalow forest than the younger regrowth. This is important for the recovery of brigalow ecosystems, an endangered ecological community where regrowth is currently given minimal protection from further clearing. Comparisons of the importance of habitat attributes using model averaging and hierarchical partitioning of generalised linear models of the species richness of woodland birds showed that bird species richness was positively associated with patch age, and that stand-level factors such as grazing disturbance and the abundance of mistletoes (Amyema spp.) were also important. The spatial context of vegetation patches (size, shape and isolation) was equally important for bird species richness, with more species of woodland dependent, nectar/frugivores and non-ground foraging insectivores occurring in less modified landscape contexts, and the converse for generalist species, ground foraging insectivores and granivores. While a number of woodland dependent bird species known to be in decline in temperate woodlands of southern Australia were absent or rare in regrowth forests, several species (e. g., eastern yellow robin) also occupied regrowth habitats. This finding suggests that these more sensitive species may respond positively to landscape restoration through targeted retention of brigalow regrowth. The landscape-level amount of forest varied in importance among regrowth age classes and bird groups. In general, the amount and number of mature forest patches in the landscape were of lower importance than local attributes. However, the amount of mature forest and old regrowth (> 30 years) in the landscape did have an important positive influence on the number of woodland bird species and species’ abundance; suggesting that regrowth is making an important contribution to landscape recovery in the study area. Mistletoe abundance was strongly dependent on particular species of frugivores for seed dispersal (e. g., mistletoebird, spiny-cheeked honeyeater and painted honeyeater), and varied considerably among three sub-regions of the study area. In general, mistletoe abundance increased in linear patches and more highly modified landscapes but was also dependent on the abundance of seed dispersers and brigalow stand condition. These findings suggest that narrow linear patches in brigalow landscapes can have important conservation values for woodland birds. The study outcomes have important implications for research and management of regrowth vegetation, both within Australia and internationally. From an international perspective, the study highlights the need for greater consideration of the importance of regrowth forest in a landscape context for conserving and restoring fauna communities. From an Australian perspective, the study provides important baseline information for the conservation and management of woodland bird habitat in fragmented brigalow landscapes. Prior to this research, very little was known on the spatial ecology of woodland birds in the region. The study highlights the important conservation values of small and often linear mature brigalow patches for woodland birds and the considerable potential for restoration of habitat for a diverse range of species through the retention of regrowth vegetation. In particular, the research outcomes suggest that targeting the retention of regrowth towards increasing the size and reducing the isolation of mature brigalow forests may be an effective strategy to maximise biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth stands will need to be retained for at least 60 years and probably longer to maintain viable woodland bird communities. For this to happen on a regional-scale, brigalow regrowth needs to be given greater recognition for potential biodiversity benefits either within a legislative framework or by incentive schemes to promote the long term persistence of regrowth habitat within the landscape...|$|E
