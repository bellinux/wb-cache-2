40|$|This paper {{discusses}} effective leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> involving capacity building, so {{that leadership}} occurs at multiple levels {{in order to}} sustain <b>and</b> transform <b>learning.</b> Literature conceptualising leadership as capacity building is examined. The paper considers practical examples of leadership as capacity building <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>and</b> poses questions for further investigation. Effective leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> must involve a significant element of capacity building, so that leadership occurs at multiple levels in an organization in order to sustain, renew <b>and</b> transform <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> for the future. As Lambert (1998, p. 75) points out, “increasing leadership capacity over time is the most productive way to bring about improvements that can be sustained”. Building leadership capacity <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> is an issue {{because it does not}} always happen. Individuals who have taught online may leave the organization and capacity is thereby lost. Online <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is affected, as finding staff to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> online papers can be a challenge. Paradoxically, online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> may hold the solution to its own dilemma, as the key to <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> lead <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> lies within the online settings: one builds capacity for leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> by engaging <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> leading with a mentor or team within these settings. Leadership obligations <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> therefore include the need for those who <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> online to work together, ensuring benefits to students, reciprocal learning for teachers involved, as well as a measure of accountability, and ultimately building of leadership capacity...|$|R

2500|$|Bennett {{says that}} his {{published}} work reflects interest {{in a number of}} theoretical issues in Religious Studies as well as <b>in</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning.</b> These include the insider-outsider problematic, the relationship between theology, Religious Studies and the study of culture, the issue of objectivity, how colonial and neo-colonial attitudes influence the study of religions and post-modern approaches to textual interpretation. He acknowledges the influence of Edward Said, Clifford Geertz and Wilfred Cantwell Smith as well as Bishop Kenneth Cragg, among others. [...] According to Ahmad Schaffat, Bennett [...] "repeatedly shows concerns about how conclusions are influenced by our assumptions and backgrounds and gives some thought to the ways of avoiding this influence". Bennett [...] "defines his approach in terms of Edward Said's criticism of Orientalism and Cantwell Smith's way of avoiding that type of criticism" [...] so that even when he [...] "describes at length some very hostile views of Christian writers on Islam and its prophet he either counters them by Muslim understanding or his own more favorable opinion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The current Superior General of the Jesuits is Arturo Sosa. The {{society is}} {{characterized}} by its ministries {{in the fields of}} missionary work, human rights, social justice and, most notably, higher education. It operates colleges and universities in various countries around the world and is particularly active in the Philippines and India. In the United States the Jesuits have historical ties to 28 colleges and universities and 61 high schools. The degree to which the Jesuits are involved in the administration of each institution varies. As of 2016, 12 of the 28 Jesuit universities in the US had non-Jesuit lay presidents. According to a 2014 article in The Atlantic, [...] "the number of Jesuit priests who are active in everyday operations at the schools isn’t nearly as high as it once was". Worldwide it runs 322 secondary schools and 172 colleges anduniversities.

This article examines the extent to which the Biology 'O’ level teachers are applying the constructivist perspective <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of Biology at 'O' level in Harare, in former group A government secondary schools in the low density suburbs. The population study consisted of three secondary schools in Zimbabwe. The data were collectedfrom 'O' level Biology teachers, Science Head of Departments, lesson observations and from relevant documents in the schools. Interviews, questionnaires, document analysis and lesson observations were used to collect the data. The extent to which the constructivist perspective is being applied was determined by examining the teachers', knowledge on the constructivist perspective; analyzing documents such as the lesson plan books and the application of the constructivist perspective during the observed lessons. Most teachers who participated in this study showed adequate knowledge about the constructivist perspective <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of Biology at 'O' level. The lessons observed showed the lack of application of the constructivist perspective <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of Biology at 'O' level.

This study was designed to discover ESL Teachers’ Readiness <b>in</b> the <b>Teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>Learning</b> of Literature. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the significant difference between male and female ESL teachers’ readiness <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of the literature component, to indicate the levels of the ESL teachers’ readiness <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of the literature component and finally to highlight the most contributing factor to ESL teachers readiness <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of the literature component. For the purpose of this study, quantitative research was utilized in which questionnaire was used to collect data. The data was analyzed using a t-test and one-way ANOVA. The survey research design in this research involved 143 ESL teachers who were teaching literature at 20 secondary schools in Kuching Division, Sarawak. From the analysis of findings it was found that {{there was no significant difference}} between male and female ESL teachers’ readiness <b>in</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of the literature component, almost 95 % of the respondents agreed that proficiency was sufficient to the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of literature <b>and</b> 90 % of them also believed that they were confident to teach literature.
