50|$|As an example, PCI Express {{does not}} have {{separate}} interrupt pins at all; instead, it uses special in-band messages to allow pin assertion or deassertion to be emulated. Some non-PCI architectures also use MSI; as another example, HP GSC devices do not have interrupt pins and can generate interrupts only by writing directly to the processor's <b>interrupt</b> <b>register</b> in memory space. The HyperTransport protocol also supports MSI.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Interrupt Controller is {{designed}} to interface with the AMBA bus. It can make the system more efficient and more responsive to critical events. Interrupt controller {{is designed}} {{with the concept of}} priority for immediate selection of peripherals which requires attention or service. The interrupt is necessary for any embedded processor based SOC design that is running a Real Time Operating System. The Interrupt Controller is fully scalable to support 32 interrupt sources and provides a programmable <b>interrupt</b> <b>register</b> which can be used to generate an interrupt under software control. Daisy chain concept is used to cascade the Interrupt Controller {{to increase the number of}} inputs. Here AHB is optimized to interface with Interrupt Controller to initiate data transfer on the AHB...|$|E

The memory contains a sequence of channel program instructions defining a set up operation wherein the contents of each of the registers in the channel register is initialized in accordance with the initial contents computed by the ALU and an access operation wherein data is transferred on the bus between a location in the memory whose address is currently stored in the pointer register and the one I/O device enabled by the resolver...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>registers,</b> an <b>Interrupt</b> Mask <b>Register</b> (IMR), an <b>Interrupt</b> Request <b>Register</b> (IRR), and an In-Service Register (ISR). The IRR {{maintains}} {{a mask of}} the current interrupts that are pending acknowledgement, the ISR maintains a mask of the interrupts that are pending an EOI, and the IMR maintains a mask of interrupts {{that should not be}} sent an acknowledgement.|$|R
5000|$|Maskable {{interrupt}} (IRQ): {{a hardware}} interrupt {{that may be}} ignored by setting a bit in an <b>interrupt</b> mask <b>register's</b> (IMR) bit-mask.|$|R
50|$|PICs {{typically}} {{have a common}} set of registers: <b>Interrupt</b> Request <b>Register</b> (IRR), In-Service <b>Register</b> (ISR), <b>Interrupt</b> Mask <b>Register</b> (IMR). The IRR specifies which interrupts are pending acknowledgement, and is typically a symbolic register which can not be directly accessed. The ISR <b>register</b> specifies which <b>interrupts</b> have been acknowledged, but are still waiting for an End Of Interrupt (EOI). The IMR specifies which interrupts are to be ignored and not acknowledged. A simple register schema such as this allows up to two distinct interrupt requests to be outstanding at one time, one waiting for acknowledgement, and one waiting for EOI.|$|R

50|$|An <b>interrupt</b> control <b>register,</b> or ICR, is a {{hardware}} register {{in a computer}} chip used to configure the chip to generate interrupts - to raise a signal on an interrupt line - in response to some event occurring within the chip or a circuit connected to the chip.|$|R

50|$|User and {{supervisor}} mode had separate banks of integer <b>registers.</b> <b>Interrupt</b> handling consisted of saving the PC, PSW, and SSW on the stack, clearing the PSW, and loading the PC and SSW from a memory trap vector.|$|R
50|$|Processors {{typically}} have an internal interrupt mask which allows software to ignore all external hardware interrupts {{while it is}} set. Setting or clearing this mask may be faster than accessing an <b>interrupt</b> mask <b>register</b> (IMR) in a PIC or disabling interrupts in the device itself. In some cases, such as the x86 architecture, disabling and enabling interrupts on the processor itself act as a memory barrier; however, it may actually be slower.|$|R

50|$|On IBM PC {{compatible}} computers {{that use the}} Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), IPI signalling is often performed using the APIC. When a CPU wishes to send an interrupt to another CPU, it stores the interrupt vector and the identifier of the target's local APIC in the <b>Interrupt</b> Command <b>Register</b> (ICR) of its own local APIC. A message is then sent via the APIC bus to the target's local APIC, which therefore issues a corresponding interrupt to its own CPU.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned alarm clock interrupt bug, many CIAs exhibited a defect in which the part would fail to generate a timer B hardware interrupt if the <b>interrupt</b> control <b>register</b> (ICR) was read one or two clock cycles before {{the time when the}} interrupt should have actually occurred. This defect, as well as logic errors in the Commodore provided (8 bit [...] ) operating system, caused frequent pseudo-RS-232 errors in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 computers when running at higher baud rates.|$|R

50|$|POKEY {{provides}} 29 Read/Write registers controlling Sound, Paddle input, keyboard input, serial input/output, and <b>interrupts.</b> Many POKEY <b>register</b> addresses have dual purposes performing different {{functions as}} a Read vs a Write register.

Memory Map of the DS 1876 The Main Device located at A 2 h is used for overall device configuration and transmitter 1 control, calibration, alarms, warnings, and monitoring. Lower Memory, A 2 h is addressed from 00 h to 7 Fh and contains alarm and warning thresholds, flags, masks, several control registers, password entry area (PWE), and the Table Select byte. Table 01 h, A 2 h primarily contains user EEPROM (with PW 1 level access) as well as alarm and warning enable bytes. Table 02 h, A 2 h/B 2 h is a multifunction space that contains configuration registers, scaling and offset values, passwords, <b>interrupt</b> <b>registers</b> {{as well as other}} miscellaneous control bytes. All functions and status can be written and read from either A 2 h or B 2 h addresses. Table 04 h, A 2 h contains a temperature-indexed look-up table (LUT) for control of the MOD 1 voltage. The MOD 1 LUT can be programmed in 2 °C increments over the- 40 °C to + 102 °C range. This table also contains a temperature-indexed LUT for the MOD 1 offsets...|$|R

5000|$|Responding to an {{interrupt}} involves {{saving the}} registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code. In a stack machine, most parameters {{are already on}} a stack. Therefore, {{there is no need}} to push them there. Often stack machines respond more quickly to <b>interrupts.</b> [...] Some <b>register</b> machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped but this increases costs and slows down the register file.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>interrupt</b> vector <b>register,</b> , is {{used for}} the Z80 {{specific}} mode 2 interrupts (selected by the [...] instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of service routine addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an interrupt acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine. The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip and/or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called daisy chain for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{mechanism}} that implements register renaming, dynamic speculation and precise <b>interrupts.</b> Renaming of <b>registers</b> is performed during the instruction fetch stage instead of the decode stage, and the mechanism is designed to operate in parallel with the tag match logic used by most cache designs. It is estimated that the critical path of the mechanism requires approximately {{the same number of}} logic levels as the tag match logic, and therefore should not impact cycle time. ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two full}} sets of {{registers}} (A, X, R, and B). One set, the user registers, {{is used by}} all applications and most portions of the operating system.

The Exec registers are not writable by user applications although some user code can read them. As a result, the Exec is carefully designed never to leave private, secure, or confidential information in registers. Instruction interpretation chooses the appropriate register set to use based on a bit in the Processor State Register. This bit is always set (changed to privileged) on an <b>interrupt.</b> All <b>registers</b> are also visible in the address space, but the Exec portion is protected and a reference by non-privileged code will result in a fault interrupt.|$|R

5000|$|Edge-triggered {{interrupts}} do {{not suffer}} {{the problems that}} level-triggered interrupts have with sharing. Service of a low-priority device can be postponed arbitrarily, and interrupts {{will continue to be}} received from the high-priority devices that are being serviced. If there is a device that the CPU does not know how to service, it may cause a spurious interrupt, or even periodic spurious interrupts, but it does not interfere with the interrupt signalling of the other devices. However, it is fairly easy for an edge triggered interrupt to be missed - for example if interrupts have to be masked for a period - and unless there is some type of hardware latch that records the event it is impossible to recover. Such problems caused many [...] "lockups" [...] in early computer hardware because the processor did not know it was expected to do something. More modern hardware often has one or more <b>interrupt</b> status <b>registers</b> that latch the interrupt requests; well written edge-driven interrupt software often checks such registers to ensure events are not missed.|$|R
