5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E

Peter {{then goes on to}} <b>express</b> <b>his</b> desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E

5|$|Sundaram, a poor man, {{comes to}} Madras with {{aspirations}} {{of becoming a}} film actor. However, he ends up getting {{a job in a}} restaurant called Greenlands Hotel as a waiter. While catering for {{a group of people who}} go on an excursion to Mahabalipuram, he meets Radha, the daughter of his restaurateur, Chakravarthy. He misinterprets her friendly nature as love and falls in love with her. In the meantime, Sundaram happens to meet his friend Raghavan, an influential businessman, in the restaurant. During their subsequent meetings, Sundaram tells Raghavan about his ambition to become an actor as well as about his love for Radha, without mentioning her name. Raghavan genuinely believes that the girl reciprocates Sundaram's feelings and motivates Sundaram to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> love.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Nocturne was {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, with additional work by Kenichi Tsuchiya and Toshiko Tasaki. Mixing {{was done by}} Meguro, Tsuchiya, and Tasaki. The soundtrack included tunes from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles composed by Tsukasa Masuko. While composing the music, Meguro attempted to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> feelings {{when he saw the}} world while remaining true to the styles established by the original Megami Tensei games. Taking inspiration from the game's dungeon-battle transitions, and the cut-scenes' combination of current graphics with classic use of subtitles for storytelling, Meguro created modulating tunes which included elements from 1980s music. Meguro also introduced orchestral elements which were absent from previous Megami Tensei scores, using it to emphasize the gameplay's constant shifts between movement and stillness. Meguro generally worked solo on the original version, but for the director's cut, he had help composing new tracks.|$|E
5|$|This sincere {{attitude}} {{seems to}} have largely prevailed in practice. Theophilus Lindsey, who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend Newcome Cappe to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> displeasure at a review in {{the first issue of}} the Analytical, demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons, but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to <b>express</b> <b>his</b> reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|When Bédard {{joined the}} project, the game {{focused on the}} 2D–3D {{mechanic}} and {{did not yet have}} open world ambitions. He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio <b>Express.</b> <b>His</b> first task, the level editor Fezzer, was coded from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. Bédard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles ("triles") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D platformer. Bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he <b>express</b> <b>his</b> interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
