50|$|While {{guarding}} the orphans, Till takes a grotesque, insect-like form with an elongated head and fingers. The children are then used in various examinations and surgeries {{with the rest}} of the band playing the doctors. The female warden is also seen assisting them in her younger form. One of the surgeries sees a child's tears extracted through a syringe, which is then vaginally injected by the Sandman. The Sandman is also subject to examinations by the doctors, as Paul H. Landers is seen giving her a gynecological examination. She later walks in a <b>dress</b> <b>shielding</b> two small children, possibly indicating that the tears are involved in a form of In vitro fertilisation. While Till is away from the main bathroom, the children (portrayed by the rest of the band as disheveled adults) escape from their cage and the orphanage. This causes Till to tear out and consume his own heart while the Heilstätten is engulfed in an inferno. The video ends with the liberated walking away from the building, while the chorus of the piano version plays in the background, signalling the video of the piano version as an afterword.|$|R

The standard-bearer holds an aquila standard, where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons.

On the contrary, these could also be a positive allusion, the mythical image of man in nature, unpolluted, symbol of purity that evokes the time in a perfect and happy world, with prototype to John the Baptist.|$|R
40|$|We are {{constructing}} Superconducting RF Test Facility (STF) at KEK for the R&D of ILC accelerator. In {{the beginning}} of year 2008, we installed one high-gradient Low-Loss (LL) 9 -cell cavity into a cryomodule (CM) at STF.

At the room-temperature, we performed the processing of input-coupler up to the RF power of 350 kW. At the temperatures of 2 K, RF power was supplied from a klystron to the cavity.

40|$|We {{selected}} {{a type of}} shielding sheet and made shielding clothes. Then, we measured the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of a human phantom model that was <b>dressed</b> in the <b>shielding</b> clothes. The measured SE for the phantom model with physiological saline and for the phantom model without physiological saline should be close. But the results are different. Therefore, we calculate {{the effect of the}} air-gap that exists between the shielding clothes and the human phantom model. From the results of the calculations, we found that the air-gap is 25 mm based on the SE from the multiple reflection of the waves. For the case of the distance from the transmitter to the surface of phantom model being 50 mm, the SE is 3. 8 dB, and for the case of the distance from the transmitter to the surface of phantom model being 220 mm, the SE is 4. 9 dB. Then, we calculate these effect by using the multi-layered model...|$|R

Now they come faster and faster, but all through the same gap in the bush.

2500|$|Throughout July 2017, Ambrose and Rollins teased a {{potential}} and partial Shield reunion for several weeks, but Ambrose continuously declined Rollins' offer to reunite, {{primarily due to}} trust issues from Rollins' betrayal three years prior. In the following weeks, Ambrose and Rollins started a feud with Raw Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus and eventually getting a title match at SummerSlam, but the two kept distrusting each other. This led the two to argue in the ring on the August 14 episode of Raw, which culminated in Ambrose and Rollins brawling with each other only to fight off Cesaro and Sheamus and performing a fist bump to a loud ovation. At SummerSlam on August 20, Ambrose and Rollins defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to capture the Raw Tag Team Championship This also made Ambrose {{the first member of}} the group to become a Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion. Ambrose and Rollins successfully defended their championship both at No Mercy on September 24 and on the October 16 episode of Raw, where they defeated Cesaro and Sheamus in rematches. After weeks of feuding with The Miztourage (Bo Dallas, Curtis Axel and The Miz) and Cesaro and Sheamus, both common enemies of Ambrose and Rollins as well as of former Shield teammate Roman Reigns, they officially reunited with Reigns on the October 9 episode of Raw, reforming The Shield. The Shield was due to face the team of Braun Strowman, Cesaro, Kane, The Miz and Sheamus on October 22 at [...] in a 5-on-3 handicap Tables, Ladders and Chairs match, but over an illness concern Kurt Angle would take Reigns' place. Ambrose, Rollins and Angle, all <b>dressed</b> in The <b>Shield's</b> ring attire, would go on to win the match. Ambrose and Rollins were due to face SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos in a non-title interbrand match at Survivor Series, but they lost the title back to Cesaro and Sheamus after SmackDown's New Day appearance on the November 6 episode of Raw, thus ending their reign at 78 days.|$|R
