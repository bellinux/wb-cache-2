The {{most common type}} of material used for network rehabilitation is Polyethylene (PE) pipe. A common method of jointing PE pipe is electrofusion welding. Here, electricity is used to heat a coil that melts the fitting and the host pipe of the same material. When the joint cools it forms a bond. However, premature failure of these can occur if best practice <b>installation</b> <b>principles</b> are not followed on site. A novel experimental rig, designed to be retrofitted to an existing servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine, has been used to cyclically pressurise PE fittings that have been created with a controlled element of 'poor workmanship'. Extensive fatigue tests have shown the relationship between joint failure and the dynamic pressures experienced in water distribution systems. Furthermore, the effects of poor workmanship have shown to have a detrimental effect on asset integrity. A post-failure analysis of the fittings using non-destructive ultra-sonic methods has shown the failure paths of the fittings.

The technology for rearing octopus is scant since the full biological cycle cannot as yet be reproduced in captivity and the production system is based on capturing juveniles in the wild, containing them in different types of cage and feeding them with trawled species of little commercial value. Given {{the present state of}} our knowledge, then, it is particularly interesting to carry out economic studies that look at the viability of such fattening installations from a cost analysis point of view, both to evaluate the present system and to look at possible future alternatives.

40|$|The solo {{exhibition}} ‘Pots – Plates – Chairs’ {{was held at}} the Marsden Woo Gallery in 2011. Each piece in the show referenced one of these three domestic object types, either singly or as a multiple. In all the works, Smith placed emphasis on the visual power of subtle variations in form and surface pattern. The pieces on show continued the creative tradition of exploring how small divergences within a repetitive schema of form or surface pattern can produce dramatic effects. The exhibition can be considered a visual analogy to the work of composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, whose compositions were a strong influence on Smith. The means by which the formal elements of line and pattern were expressed through the medium of ceramic or wood was the result of extensive visual research and associated technical development. The geometric surface patterns used for the two plate <b>installations</b> used <b>principles</b> established in Islamic pattern and the wall drawings of Sol LeWitt.

40|$|In the {{conditions}} of global climate changes shortage of fresh water becomes an urgent problem for {{an increasing number of}} the countries. One of the most perspective technologies of a desalting of sea water is the mechanical vapour compression (MVC) providing low energy consumption due to the principle of a heat pump. Aim: The aim of this research is to identify the reserves of efficiency increasing of the desalination systems based on mechanical vapour compression by optimization of the scheme and parameters of installations with MVC. Materials and Methods: The new type of desalination installation is offered which main element is the heat exchanger of the latent heat. Sea water after preliminary heating in heat exchangers comes to the evaporator-condenser where receives the main amount of heat from the condensed steam. A part of sea water evaporates, and the strong solution of salt (brine) goes out of the evaporator, and after cooling is dumped back in the sea. The formed steam is compressed by the compressor and comes to the condenser. An essential singularity of this scheme is that condensation happens at higher temperature, than evaporation. Thanks to this the heat, which is comes out at devaporation, is used for evaporation of sea water. Thereby, in this class of desalination <b>installations</b> the <b>principle</b> of a heat pump is implemented. Results: For achievement of a goal the following tasks were solved: the mathematical model of installations with MVC is modified and supplemented; the scheme of heat exchangers switching is modified; influence of design data of desalination installation on the cost of an inventory and the electric power is investigated. The detailed analysis of the main schemes of installation and mathematical model allowed defining ways of decrease in energy consumption and the possible merit value. Influence of two key parameters - a specific power of the compressor and a specific surface area of the evaporator-condenser - on a value of given expenses of desalination installation is analyzed.

The power part of «Smart Grid – DonNTU» laboratory represents block structure in which in the blocks form such models are realized: physical model of a thermal power plant, a real solar power plant, wind turbines models, energy stores, reactive power compensators. The special bench for detailed studying of modern digital relay protection of the SiprotecTM series of Siemens® production is also realized. The physical model of the condensation turbine of a thermal power plant, and also models of wind-generating installations are executed by means of induction electrical motors with the short-circuited rotor, established on one shaft with generators of AC current. The solar power plant realized in laboratory, represents fifty five modern solar panels of the Ukrainian production with a total power of 10 kW.

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{installing}} tidal energy technology are high, requiring expensive vessels to drill sockets {{in the sea}} bed or to handle gravity based structures of substantial mass, and this impacts on the commercial viability of any proposed marine renewables development. This thesis offers {{a viable alternative to}} socketed or gravity based installations by proposing that the downwards lift force that can be developed from the flow over a hydrofoil can be used to resist the slip and overturning moments applied to a structure by the flow. The fundamental theory of axial and crossflow energy conversion devices is outlined and the current methods of fixing and supporting tidal stream devices are analysed. The origins of tidal stream flows are discussed and the effects of local topography, bathymetry and system resonance are used to explain the significant differences between real tidal behaviour and the ideal of Newton’s equilibrium theory. The idiosyncratic and localised nature of tidal streams is thereby made clear as well as the need for a solid understanding of the resource prior to device design and <b>installation.</b> The <b>principles</b> of classical hydrodynamics and conformal mapping are used in the context of relating theoretical lift and drag functions to low aspect ratio hydrofoils with endplates, and a numerical model of distributed surface pressures around a hydrofoil is demonstrated. Subsequently, the concept is evaluated using two 1 / 7 th scale test devices, one is field tested in a large stream under real flow conditions, and the second in a tow tank under ideal laboratory conditions. The limitations and challenges of model scaling are shown and the semi-empirical Froude method of scaling using residual forces is applied to the towing model. Analysis of the experimental data shows a correlation with normal distribution and extrapolation of the experimental results shows that the Sea Snail can operate with an average lift coefficient of 0. 7 and drag coefficient of 0. 18. Application of the experimental data to the full scale device demonstrates that the Sea Snail principle is not only valid, but is a significant advance on existing installation methodologies.

40|$|Any {{deviation}} of voltage or current from the ideal sinusoidal waveform {{is a power}} quality (PQ) disturbance. PQ disturbances can be broadly classified into two categories, Variations and Events. Variations are disturbances which {{have an effect on}} every cycle, such as harmonics or voltage unbalance. Events are disturbances which last for a time, from a fraction of a cycle to several cycles, and then may not repeat for several hours or days. Transients and voltage dips are examples of events. It is not economically viable to eliminate PQ disturbances completely. However, they cannot be allowed to become too large, otherwise equipment costs would have to increase to account for the increased immunity required. The basic principles of EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) are used to develop a process by which equipment can be guaranteed to operate satisfactorily on the supply network. The basic idea is that, for each disturbance type, a value called the compatibility level is established and that: • All equipment should have immunity levels greater than the compatibility level. • The PQ disturbance level on the network has to be constrained to be less than the compatibility level. This paper discusses the work undertaken to characterise the emission levels of equipment and electrical network and using this information devise PQ guidelines for the New Zealand electricity industry. The management of emission levels is broadly similar for all disturbance types with some differences in detail. The treatment given in this paper is particularly relevant to harmonics, where a new voltage droop approach is presented. This basically determines a harmonic voltage allocation, which is then converted into a current allocation by assuming a given system harmonic impedance. Different approaches are adopted for LV and MV <b>installations.</b> The main <b>principles</b> are: 1. Time varying harmonic quantities are represented by their 95 % values. 2.

40|$|To {{cope with}} the demands of FAIR for UNILAC highcurrent operation, non-intercepting beam {{diagnostics}} is mandatory. A new diagnostic for transverse beam profile measurements, the Beam Induced Fluorescence monitor (BIF) was developed. After the first BIF installation in 2008 (Unilac section US 1), three new monitors were installed (Unilac section UA 4 and transfer-line sections TK 2 and TK 6) and several upgrades were performed to make the monitors more reliable and easier to use for the upcomming handover to operation. For FAIR several BIF monitors are destined for p-Linac, HEBT and SFRS and it is foreseen to realize all slow controls by Siemens SPS and FESA-based software. <b>Principle</b> and <b>Installation</b> The BIF <b>principle</b> is based on the observation of fluorescent light, emitted by excited gas (e. g. nitrogen) molecules [1]. A custom designed image-intensified camera system (Proxitronic) performs single-photon counting to ensure single-shot measurements at low inserted gas pressure. Each BIF monitor consists of two perpendicularly mounted cameras to measure transversal beam profiles in horizontal and vertical plane, see fig. 1. Further hardware details are described in [2]. A newly integrated Siemens SPS controlled by FESA serves all slow controls (gain settings, iris control, calibration LEDs) and controls all power supplies for the instruments in the tunnel [3]. Several protection procedures are implemented to prevent the image intensifiers from damage.

40|$|My thesis aims {{to explore}} and present {{textiles}} as a sculptural material in contemporary art. I briefly introduce thread as the building block and consequently a material similar to textile, which is also used as an independent material in sculpture. Like textiles, thread in sculpture appears and becomes widely recognised relatively late. It is frequently used by women, as it is mostly characterised as women's material due to the sewing tradition, which is a predominantly female domain. To illustrate, I outline the concept of contemporary art, a period of art history in which textile appears {{for the first time}} as a part of a sculpture. I refer to contemporary art, in which fabric as material in sculpture begins to experience its heyday. I present certain avandgarde movements and tendencies that played a major role in this regard. The thesis attempts to capture and present all the main uses of textiles in sculpture, while at the same time presenting those who, in my opinion, are prominent artists using one or more of these methods in their work and artistic expression. The thesis is focused on Ernesto Neto, a contemporary sculptor, and his interactive installations that are often made of translucent nylon. I was strongly impressed by the Brazilian artist already some years ago; he influenced my work which is presented in the practical part of the thesis. During my studies, I exhibited these works as part of several group and two solo exhibitions under the guidance of my mentor, Prof. Roman Makše.

A usfuhrlich wird das Phanomen der Lichtubertragung mittels Glasstabchen beschrieben; schematisch sind die Lichtleitungsfassern und das Prinzip der Faseroptik dargestellt. Die Vorteille des kalten Lichtes fur intraorale und intradentale Eingriffe sind beschrieben, ebenfalls gute Erfahrungen mit dem Apparat lntralux. An 4 Kolor-abbildungen sind die Vorteile des kalten Lichtes bei zahnartztlichen Eingriffen anschaulich dargestellt. Da Apparate mit der Faseroptik optimale Lichte ffekte ergeben, sind die Autoren der Meinung, dass Gerate mit kalten Licht in der Zukunft in zahnartzlichen Ambulanten mehr zur Anwendung kommen werden...|$|R

This instrument provides precise deformation {{monitoring of the}} (proposed) repository block. This document describes {{the history of the}} <b>installation,</b> outlines the <b>principles</b> of operation of the system, documents the integral recording and control system and file formats used, and provides information on how QA has been implemented, with the aim of being a self-contained description which could be used (in conjunction with the data files at the TDMS) to understand the measurements made by the LSM. Appendix A gives the unique digital signatures for all data files submitted to the TDMS. The instrument was installed along the south wall of the tunnel, between 69 + 46 m and 65 + 41 m (tunnel coordinates). The resulting azimuth (91 °) provides good sensitivity to the posited long-term strains from geologic sources. Designing an instrument for the tunnel was a challenge, as was installing it, given the usual, strict local operating procedures; these two elements combined to increase substantially the overall time to completion, though the experience gained has put us in a good position for further work in this setting. We have fully documented (SN) all aspects of the installation, and have complete engineering plans of the LSM available (Appendix B). The instrument began operating to QA standards on 2002 : 233 (August 21, 2002), and has recorded strain since that time, though with interruptions caused by the very strong shaking from the mining trains, which both caused sizeable gaps in the series and caused the lasers to degrade much more rapidly: both problems have been dealt with successfully. The instrument is producing quality records. Preliminary results from the laser strainmeter suggest that seismic waves and tides cause strains with no obvious anomalous response or nonlinearity; and that air-pressure changes can cause significant strains, with a response that depends on the spatial pattern of pressure applied. With the data so far available, we can constrain the long-term strain rate to be less than 0. 2 /z£/yr. A longer-term record should greatly improve this constraint...|$|R
40|$|Installation of seabed {{equipment}} represents {{approximately one}} third of the capital expenditures (CAPEX) for subsea developments. This report is based on investigating into new designs of subsea production system (SPS) structures that can appear to be cost-effective concerning seabed <b>installation.</b> Firstly, the <b>principle</b> of modularization of subsea production structures is considered. Secondly, an investigation into the use of non-metallic materials for construction elements in the subsea structures is carried out. Thus, in addition to the already existing integrated template structure (ITS), a new modularized tight cluster design, called X-Cat, is regarded through the report. Due to the high weight and large footprint of an ITS, only large and costly vessels can be mobilized for the installation of the structure. However, the X-Cat contains smaller modules, which increases the potential of the possibility of using smaller and lighter installation vessels. If the unit-weight of the limiting X-Cat module is reduced accordingly, it will increase the potential of using even smaller and lighter installation vessels. The first approach in the investigation was to suggest three new designs with lower unit-weights for the limiting X-Cat module. The suggested designs were developed by changing the material of selected construction elements from steel to fiberglass, which would reduce the unit-weight significantly. Furthermore, installation cost estimations were performed for the installation of the suggested designs and, subsequently, the effect of reducing vessel size was demonstrated by cost comparisons. In addition, as the alternative structures contained suction anchor technology, a further sensitivity analysis on suction anchor installations with regards to critical pressures were carried out. From the results, installation duration estimates demonstrated that a single ITS could be installed almost twice as fast as a single X-Cat. However, it was observed that if SPS construction elements could be designed in glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) instead of steel, the structures could {{have a positive impact on}} the installation costs, as smaller and lighter vessels from a much larger vessel pool could potentially be mobilized for the operations. Concerning the sensitivity analysis on suction anchor installations, the results demonstrated that the suction caisson belonging to the X-Cat should be designed with significantly larger skirt thickness relative to the ITS suction anchors. This report concludes that a material change from steel to fiberglass in construction elements for a modularized SPS design will reduce the unit weight of the structure, and further reduce the installation design load; by reducing the weight of the structure by using GRP as construction material, the corresponding installation cost reduction of the X-Cat could potentially exceed 50 %. Further work should involve looking into the manufacturing costs of SPS construction elements made in GRP. It should also include an evaluation and assessment concerning the seastate of large fiberglass structures during subsea installations. </p...|$|R
