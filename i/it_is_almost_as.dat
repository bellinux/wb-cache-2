500|$|As Madonna {{considered}} her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray were experimenting with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. Both {{of them wanted}} to bring their unique style to the project, and composed music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album. The singer has described [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as the song of a passionate young girl [...] "so in love with God that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> though He were the male figure in her life." ...|$|E

Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world."

The magazine said Solomon Northup's Odyssey at the time of airing [...] "has been praised by critics who are calling for a theater release as well". John Corry of The New York Times said of the film, [...] "It gives us an earnest and intelligent depiction, although its real subject—the moral effect of slavery—stays just out of reach. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> if the drama's good taste is keeping it at bay." [...] Corry said the direction obeying the [...] "fidelity of history" [...] made the setting and the society less harsh: [...] "It is not meant this way, but an intolerable institution is made to look almost benign."

In Madonna's own words, the songs [...] "intertwine her search for faith with her search for her mother". The opening track is [...] "Like a Prayer", which {{was also the first}} song developed for the album.

She described [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as the song of a passionate young girl [...] "so in love with God that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> though He were the male figure in her life." [...] It's a pop rock song with elements of gospel music. A choir provides background vocals that heighten the song's spiritual nature, and a rock guitar keeps the music dark and mysterious. [...] The second track, [...] "Express Yourself", talks about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; throughout the song, subtexts are employed. According to the singer, the track is a tribute to Sly & the Family Stone. The third track, [...] "Love Song", is a duet with recording artist Prince. The song was co-written by Madonna and Prince and features the artist's [...] "signature scratchy disco guitar breaks through Madonna's synths".|$|E
2500|$|Since {{they feed}} by {{grabbing}} and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for piercing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles {{to close the}} jaws and hold them shut. The teeth are not well-suited to tearing flesh off of large prey items as are the dentition and claws of many mammalian carnivores, the hooked bills and talons of raptorial birds, or the serrated teeth of sharks. However, this is an advantage rather than a disadvantage to the crocodile since {{the properties of the}} teeth allow it to hold onto prey with the least possibility of the prey animal to escape. Otherwise combined with the exceptionally high bite force, the flesh would easily cut through; thus creating an escape opportunity for the prey item. The jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The force of a large crocodile's bite is more than , which was measured in a [...] Nile crocodile, on the field, compared to just [...] for a Rottweiler, [...] for a great white shark, [...] for a hyena, or [...] for an American alligator. A [...] long saltwater crocodile has been confirmed as having the strongest bite force ever recorded for an animal in a laboratory setting. It was able to apply a bite force value of , and thus surpassed the previous record of [...] made by a [...] long American alligator. Taking the measurements of several [...] crocodiles as reference, the bite forces of 6-m individuals were estimated at [...] The study, led by Dr. Gregory M. Erickson, also shed light to the larger, extinct species of crocodilians. Since crocodile anatomy has changed only slightly for the last 80 million years, current data on modern crocodilians can be used to estimate the bite force of extinct species. An [...] long Deinosuchus would apply a force of , twice that of the latest, higher bite force estimations of Tyrannosaurus. The extraordinary bite of crocodilians is a result of their anatomy. The space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. The nature of the muscle is so stiff, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> hard as bone to touch, {{as if it were the}} continuum of the skull. Another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile's jaw is arranged for clamping down. Despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes.|$|E
