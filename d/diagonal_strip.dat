Dried shiitake {{mushrooms are}} soaked in lukewarm water, {{and if a}} small amount of sugar is added to the water, that helps the mushrooms to rehydrate more quickly. The stipes of the mushroom are taken out, and the caps are shredded and seasoned. Green chili peppers are seeded and chopped and onions and carrots are chopped into pieces {{the same size as the}} peppers. Scallions are cut into long <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} part of a larger building, and hence has no {{separate}} architectural identity. It is marked by the interesting and unusual dedicatory inscription over the entrance, which is written in concentric circles within a tondo. This tondo is flanked by two <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips</b> of cornice each with a faint S-curve, and which join to it via tiny volutes. The inscription reads [...] "Divis Benedicto et Scholasticae Patronis nursinus ordo et populus", which translates as [...] "To the honoured patrons Benedict and Scholastica, the council and people of Norcia".|$|R

Dilatation growth in Ficus pumila is mostly the result of meristematic activity, but in Ficus sycomorus it {{is the result of}} both meristematic activity and increase in cell size. Dilatation meristem is formed in the rays in various patterns: {{in the center of the}} ray, at one or two of the ray 2 ̆ 7 s margins, in horizontal or <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips</b> (relative to the axis) in the ray, or in more than one pattern in a single ray...|$|R
50|$|Fuvahmulah was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} nine wards. From North to South these wards were: (1) Dhadimago, (2) Diguvāndo (both stretching from East to West shore), (3) Hōdhado, (5) Dhashokubaa (both segmental) and separated by, (4) Mādhado, (A <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> of parallel width). The other four divisions, occupying {{the southern part}} of the island, consisted of two eastern and western strips, bisected into four wards, (6) Mālegan and (8) Dūndigan lying to the East, (7) Miskimmago and (9) Funādo to the West.|$|E
50|$|The Uruguayan coach Ondino Viera, who {{before had}} won championships with Nacional in Montevideo, CA River Plate in Buenos Aires joined Vasco {{at the same}} time. He not only re-introduced the since then typical kit with the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> but also a number of {{tactical}} innovations. The former boxer Mário Américo, who should later acquire later worldwide fame as the physiotherapist of the Brazilian national team across seven World Cups from 1950 to 1974, was another new addition to the club.|$|E
50|$|The griffin, a {{creature}} in Greek mythology, seeks hidden treasure while protecting its own treasure from intruders. The griffin symbolizes {{the search for}} the treasure from intruders. The griffin symbolizes {{the search for the}} treasure of knowledge in areas yet unknown and unexplored. The Maltese Cross, awarded to the bravest and most courageous military men, indicates a devotion to duty and a dedication to success. The cross, positioned above the black <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip,</b> indicates a higher ideal in life to which one should strive.|$|E
50|$|Later {{experiments}} involved surface coatings. Between 1901 and 1907 Austria applied varnish bars, thin <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips</b> of varnish, to {{the paper}} before printing the design. Russia did the same between 1909 and 1915, applying the varnish in a pattern of lozenges. In both cases the (not very convincing) theory was the same; the ink of the printed design would not soak into the varnish, {{so that in the}} washing process the design would tend to flake off, forming a telltale pattern on the washed stamp. The United States also coated a few of their $1 revenue stamps with varnish {{around the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In Normandy and the Loire Valley of France, farm silos {{were often}} {{attached}} to the main living quarters instead of a separate barn. After World War I, Americans romanticized the traditional French farmhouse, creating a style known as French Normandy. Sided with stone, stucco, or brick, these homes may suggest the Tudor style with decorative half timbering (vertical, horizontal, and <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips</b> of wood set in masonry). The French Normandy style is distinguished by a round stone tower topped by a cone-shaped roof. The tower is usually placed near the centre, serving as {{the entrance to the}} home. French Normandy and French provincial details are often combined to create a style simply called French Country or French Rural carved or embossed on mouldings, sconces, and banisters.|$|R
50|$|The school uniform {{consists}} of a blazer with the school emblem on, dark trousers or a dark skirt for the girls, dark shoes and a school tie. The school tie is a navy blue background with <b>diagonal</b> smaller <b>strips</b> of gold and red, but the prefects wear a red tie. The boys wear sports shirts with vertical blue and white stripes.|$|R
50|$|The second version, {{which first}} {{appeared}} in 1983, was packaged with the revised version of the Expert Set by Frank Mentzer, and featured cover art by Timothy Truman. Its cover featured a red-orange border. The revised version used the layout elements that were typical of mid-1980s Dungeons & Dragons adventures: the game's current logo was prominently featured on the cover, the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> was replaced with a horizontal one across the top, and the back cover featured no illustration but did have a text description of the adventure. There are a few minor differences besides appearance between this and the earlier version, including the replacement of a few monsters, and a mapping error that makes part of the final temple appear to be completely inaccessible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dominant}} {{trees are}} American elm, basswood, sugar maple, and red oak. The understory {{is composed of}} ironwood, green ash, and aspen.

5000|$|The {{controversy}} {{between the}} [...] "absolute" [...] and [...] "relative" [...] ways {{of giving the}} time is largely one of regional dialect differences: the [...] "relative" [...] variant (as in [...] "viertel/Viertel vor/auf drei") is the much more common one as it is used in a wide <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> from Hamburg to Switzerland, leaving some of the German south-west and most of eastern Germany {{as well as the}} eastern half of Austria with the [...] "absolute" [...] variant (as in [...] "dreiviertel drei" [...] or [...] "drei Viertel drei"). For half-hours, the absolute form as in [...] "halb zwei" [...] is used everywhere. The term controversy may be appropriate insofar as [...] "relativists" [...] often complain {{about not being able to}} decode the [...] "absolute" [...] way of telling the time, resulting in missed appointments etc. The same way of giving the time is used also in Slovenia (of course using Slovenian language) perhaps as the remnant of the old Austro-Hungarian times.|$|E
40|$|For the shear {{strengthening}} of masonry walls, different configurations for FRP sheets are currently used in real application, such as vertical, horizontal or <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips.</b> In the last configuration the FRP sheet is inclined {{with respect to}} the direction of mortar joints. In the experimental campaign presented in this paper, it is investigated whether the FRP-masonry bond could be affected by this inclination. In order to analyze this issue, three different typologies of masonry panels (with different textures) retrofitted by FRP sheets, inclined of 45 degrees {{with respect to the}} vertical axis of the specimen, are subjected to single-lap shear tests. Results of shear tests are presented in terms of maximum debonding forces, force-elongation curves, failure modes and strain profiles along the specimens. The use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique allowed to obtain complete strain maps {{on the surface of the}} specimens tested, with the purpose of investigating possible variations in the strain field within the bonded area...|$|R

25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, <b>diagonal</b> <b>strips.</b> The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|R
5000|$|Two very different-looking {{versions}} of this adventure were printed. The first edition was printed in 1981, and the second edition in 1983; both were thirty two page books in an outer folder which featured cover artwork by Jeff Dee. [...] The Isle of Dread was included in every copy of the 1981 version of the D&D Expert Set {{as an example of}} an outdoor adventure and setting. This version is laid out in the style characteristic of early D&D adventures: it had no Dungeons & Dragons logo, a <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> in the top left corner indicated which edition of the game it was for, and the back cover featured an illustration and a list of other D&D products of the time. It was available on its own and packaged with the original version of the Expert Set by David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook. It was often sold already three-hole punched, and had several distinguishable printings of its own.|$|E
50|$|Fuvahmulah was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} nine wards. From North to South these wards were: (1) Dhadimago, (2) Diguvāndo (both stretching from East to West shore), (3) Hōdhado, (5) Dhashokubaa (both segmental) separated by, (4) Mādhado (A <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> of parallel width); whilst {{the other four}} divisions, which occupied the Southern {{part of the island}} consisted of two Eastern and Western strips, bisected into four wards, (6) Mālegan and (8) Dūndigan lying to East, (7) Miskimmago and (9) Funādo to West. The largest division among all is Dhadimago. With time, some changes saw its way into existence. Nowadays, the number of wards has been reduced to eight, since the village of Dhashokubaa was merged with Miskimmago. Moreover, extension of some wards with time, brought its way into certain changes in area such as that of Hōdhado. The northerly extension of the ward by time led to the land from Eastern strip of Diguvāndo and some parts of that of Dhadimago being claimed to the village. It was mainly the land consisting of agricultural fields and plantations to vegetation owned by the villagers of Dhadimago and Diguvāndo.|$|E
50|$|According to some authors, the red stripe on {{the white}} field was {{inspired}} by the colors of the flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany which ruled the island with the House of Medici first and the House of Habsburg-Lorraine after. Robert Christophe mentions that The Emperor himself designed the flag. During the five days of the journey, he studied some books about Elba which he brought from Fontainebleau. Inspired by the Medici coat of arms, the ancient rulers of the island, he designed a new flag with a white background and a <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> with three golden bees on top. The symbol of Florence would have been appreciated by the people of Elba and the golden bees, memory of the imperial mantle, were intended as a tribute to the soldiers who, under the command of Cambronne, after crossing France, were going to reach Portoferraio 20 days after. The flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the House of Medici had, however, {{nothing to do with the}} flag of Elba with the exception of the white background while the flag of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, being red-white-red horizontal stripes, resembles the Elba flag due to the colors.|$|E
5000|$|... 1899 {{also saw}} the {{appearance}} of varnish bars, as <b>diagonal</b> shiny yellowish <b>strips</b> applied to the stamp paper before printing, intended to prevent cleaning and reuse of stamps. The experiment was abandoned with the 1908 issue.|$|R
40|$|A Muon Tracking Detector {{has been}} built up in an {{underground}} tunnel north of {{the centre of the}} KASCADE experiment. It measures muons and their directions in EAS by using Limited Streamer Tubes. For that purpose tracks with hits in 2 and 3 modules are considered, each hit consisting of a signal from a wire pair and from influence strips perpendicular to them. <b>Diagonal</b> <b>strips</b> are used to reduce ambiguities. In order to get a good determination of the muon production height by means of triangulation, a good separation of multiple muon tracks close to the shower core and a good angular resolution is needed. Methods of improving the angular resolution of the detector system are presented. Investigations have been conducted to separate the wire pair signals and to include drift time measurements. Simulations of the electric field in a Streamer Tube cell (9) and also the distance - drift time correlation are presented, as well as the resulting detector resolution. With respect to the KASCADEGrande upgrade the improved resolution becomes very valuable, because of increasing muon densities at higher energies of the primary shower particles...|$|R
2500|$|Almost all the {{pictures}} acquired by Mariner 10 that were used for mapping were obtained during the first encounter: those covering the southeast half of the quadrangle are incoming close-encounter images, and those covering the north-west corner are outgoing close-encounter images. At the time {{the pictures}} were obtained, the terminator was at about long 7° to 8°, within {{the eastern part of}} the quadrangle. A large gap in coverage between the incoming and outgoing images appears as a northeast-trending <b>diagonal</b> blank <b>strip</b> on the base map. A small part of this gap was filled in the southwestern part of the quadrangle by very poor second-encounter images.|$|R
30|$|Finite-element method (FEM) {{has become}} a {{powerful}} tool for the numerical simulation of engineering problems. FEM, therefore, is considered a benchmark, as its solutions are very accurate. The structural analysis program (SAP 2000 2010) was used as an FEM tool for analysis purposes and the results of the proposed method are compared with FEM. In the present work, the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> method (DSM) was developed, which produces BM similar to finite-element method (FEM) results. This method provides reinforcement for a calculated bending moment without any increase in the percentage of steel.|$|E

In contrast to the currently accepted topographic schema, all cortical areas examined project to longitudinal territories that occupy restricted medial-lateral domains of the neostriatum. The posterior parietal and superior arcuate cortices project to dorsolateral portions of the neostriatum; the dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices project centrally; and the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal projections are distributed to ventromedial regions of the caudate nucleus and putamen. In coronal section, cortical terminal fields form a <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip,</b> extending from the dorsal, ventricular border of the caudate nucleus...|$|E
30|$|The <b>diagonal</b> <b>strip</b> {{method is}} simple {{and based on the}} unit width method. In the {{conventional}} method, the unit width is considered to be the horizontal direction or vertical direction. Footings are designed for loads from a column. When the connection between the column and the footing is rigid, the stresses develop at each point of the footing. The maximum distance {{from the face of the}} column is the diagonal distance, so using the horizontal distance or vertical distance from the column face is inappropriate. However, using the diagonal distance in the moment calculation gives the maximum moment at the column face. The diagonal distance to be considered is shown in Fig.  9.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} shear-bending experiments performed on panel shear walls used as load-carrying capacity {{walls in the}} construction of prefabricated timber structures. The aim of research is to determine the difference in resistance and ductility between panel shear walls, reinforced with two different methods. While the first, reinforcing with additional fiberboard, was not improve resistance and especially ductility in the contended sense, we tried to find a solution by inserting <b>diagonal</b> steel <b>strips,</b> which were fixed to the timber frame. Additionally, analytical solutions of those by mathematical modeling with the fictive thickness and height of fiber-plaster boards are proposed.

40|$|Recent post-earthquake {{reconnaissance}} missions {{have shown}} {{a high degree of}} damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) structures. Externally bonded systems based on fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) and fabric-reinforced cementitious matrices (FRCMs) may be used to increase lateral capacity of existing URM walls. In this paper, the in-plane lateral strength of tuff stone masonry walls in both as-built and strengthened conditions is investigated. <b>Diagonal</b> FRP <b>strips</b> and FRCM composite are considered as strengthening systems. Based on capacity models as well as statistics and probability distributions for material properties, geometry and models, a probabilistic analysis was carried out through Monte Carlo simulation. Shear force versus axial force strength domains corresponding to several percentile levels were derived. Simplified dimensionless equations were finally obtained via robust regression analysis as a practice-oriented tool for both design and assessment of externally-strengthened masonry walls...|$|R
