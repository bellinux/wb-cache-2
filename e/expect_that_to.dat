500|$|Parker {{had every}} reason to <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> occur again. The Regulars would march to Concord, find nothing, and return to Boston, tired but empty-handed. He {{positioned}} his company carefully. [...] He placed them in parade-ground formation, on Lexington Common. [...] They were in plain sight (not hiding behind walls), but not blocking the road to Concord. [...] They made a show of political and military determination, but no effort to prevent the march of the Regulars. Many years later, one of the participants recalled Parker's words as being what is now engraved in stone {{at the site of the}} battle: [...] "Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here." [...] According to Parker's sworn deposition taken after the battle: ...|$|E

60|$|Our {{young woman}} had a sense that if that view could only be put before her with a {{particular}} sniff for poor Mr. Mudge she should hate {{it as much as}} she morally ought. She was conscious of not, as yet, hating it quite so much as that. But she saw that Mrs. Jordan was conscious of something too, and that there was a degree of confidence she was waiting little by little to arrive at. The day came when the girl caught a glimpse of what was still wanting to make her friend feel strong; which was nothing less than the prospect of being able to announce the climax of sundry private dreams. The associate of the aristocracy had personal calculations--matter for brooding and dreaming, even for peeping out not quite hopelessly from behind the window-curtains of lonely lodgings. If she did the flowers for the bachelors, in short, didn't she <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> have consequences very different from such an outlook at Cocker's as she had pronounced wholly desperate? There seemed in very truth something auspicious in the mixture of bachelors and flowers, though, when looked hard in the eye, Mrs. Jordan was not quite prepared to say she had expected a positive proposal from Lord Rye to pop out of it. Our young woman arrived at last, none the less, at a definite vision of what was in her mind. This was a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of Mr. Mudge would, unless conciliated in advance by a successful rescue, almost hate her on the day she should break a particular piece of news. How could that unfortunate otherwise endure to hear of what, under the protection of Lady Ventnor, was after all so possible.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} Alexander Aguirre, {{national security}} adviser to then President Joseph Estrada, stated the bombing {{was the first time}} a Philippine diplomatic post had been bombed and that the Philippine government [...] "didn't <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2007 he was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for archbishop of Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in 2007. In August 2013 {{he said he did}} not see himself returning to Germany as an archbishop, that he was focused on Rome and he did not <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{breach of}} section 12(1)(a) was {{therefore}} sufficient, {{in the circumstances}} of this case, to render the applicant's detention unlawful {{for the purposes of}} a delictual claim for damages. [...] "That," [...] wrote Langa, [...] "will be {{the most effective way to}} vindicate the applicant's constitutional right. I <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be the case in most instances of unlawful detention." [...] The order made by the Supreme Court of Appeal was accordingly set aside.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some critics}} gave the show {{a far more}} {{positive}} review. Jane Simon of The Mirror wrote: [...] "I know what you're thinking: Morgana who?

5000|$|In the Best Buy 400, Stewart was {{involved}} in another crash with Elliott Sadler, in which Sadler got turned by David Gilliland and car collected Stewart and 11 other cars; those included Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Denny Hamlin. Stewart, who was frustrated over his misfortune, sarcastically said, [...] "I take 100 percent responsibility - it's my fault for being anywhere close to Elliott. If I'm within half a lap of him, I <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen. It's my fault - I'm the one that hit him. When I hit him, it caused all the guys behind us to wreck, so it's my fault." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{examples}} of positive support for STOCK include President Obama who upon signing the bill reassured that congressional members must {{play by the}} same rules as regular citizens. Obama regards the STOCK act {{as a way to}} monitor congressional activity and create transparency within the branch. He spoke to this point by adding, [...] "It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else.... If we <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> apply to our biggest corporations and our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials" ...|$|E
50|$|For Heimdallr {{there is}} no variant account of his father. The same {{may not be true}} for Bragi if Bragi is taken to be the skaldic poet Bragi Boddason made into a god. But Týr, {{according}} to the Eddic poem Hymiskvida, was son of the giant Hymir rather than a son of Odin. As to Höd, outside of the single statement in the kennings, Snorri makes no mention that Höd is Baldr's brother or Odin's son, though one might <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be emphasized. In Saxo's version of the death of Baldr, Höd, whom Saxo calls Høtherus, is a mortal and in no way related to Saxo's demi-god Baldur.|$|E

5000|$|Cooper {{testified that}} Jackson was {{clinically}} dead upon {{arriving at the}} hospital, and that Murray had {{told her he had}} given Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) sometime earlier that day, then another 2 mg, which caused the cardiac arrest. During cross-examination, Cooper was asked about the effect of propofol as a sedative. She said about a [...] "milligram per kilogram" [...] would be the starting dose on a patient and would be administered into the patient's arm through an injection port. The administration would take place over a period of [...] "a minute to a minute and a half", and personnel would constantly monitor the patient. She further testified that sedation would be expected to last 10 minutes. When asked what effect [...] "25 mg over 3-5 minutes" [...] would have on a patient, she responded that she would not <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> have any effect. When asked about administering propofol through an IV drip, she said that only occurs if the patient is intubated and the desired effect is deep sedation.|$|E
5000|$|Long {{said the}} panel {{considered}} less frequent rankings, but ultimately {{decided on a}} weekly release. [...] "That's what the fans have become accustomed to, and we felt it would leave a void in college football without a ranking for several weeks," [...] he said. Long also noted: [...] "Early on there was some talk that we would go into {{a room at the}} end of the season and come out with a top four, but that didn't last long." [...] In analyzing this change in thinking, Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated commented: [...] "The whole point of the selection committee was to replace the simplistic horse-race nature of Top 25 polls - where teams only move up if someone above them loses - with a more deliberative evaluation method. Now the playoff folks are going to try to do both." [...] Addressing the [...] "pecking order" [...] nature of traditional polls, George Schrodeder of USA Today wrote that [...] "if it actually works as intended, we could see volatile swings" [...] from week to week, with lower-ranked teams moving ahead of higher-ranked teams without either team losing (a rarity in traditional polls). Both Long and Bill Hancock, the CFP executive director, say they <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, a film {{loosely based}} on the novel was {{directed}} by Jack Smight. Roger Zelazny had liked the original script by Lukas Heller and <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be the filmed version; he did not realize until he saw it in the theater that the shooting script (by Alan Sharp) was quite different. He never liked the movie and was embarrassed by it. However, assertions <b>that</b> he requested <b>to</b> have his name removed from the film (and that the studio refused) are completely unfounded. The movie was released before he ever discovered he did not like it.|$|R

5000|$|GZA {{was asked}} about {{producers}} and having fewer guest appearances on the album, responding [...] "I’m not one who works with big producers because I <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> make the album go double platinum. I remember once we paid $150,000 for a Trackmasters beat once, with Ron Isley singing, the “Back In The Game” track off of Iron Flag, and it wasn’t even a single, so I don’t bother searching for names. I’d rather people buy the record because they want a GZA album, and then the extras be a surprise. The album {{as a whole has}} only two Clan members on it. The last day we were recording, I was in Paris supporting the Wu tour, and a call was put out that I was in the studio and the only two that showed up were RZA & Masta Killa, so that’s what we went with. My next album is going to be no guest appearances. Emcees need to start carrying their own weight". In the same interview, he gave a response about having only a few RZA-produced songs on the album, stating [...] "Well, you have to put in time with your producer, and RZA and I have been working back since I was 11 & he was 8 going to the Bronx to check out this hip hop stuff, so you have to know where they are coming from. Whenever I close my eyes and listen to his stuff, I can’t put a rhyme to it. His beats are more cinematic".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The article investigates how {{poor and}} social {{assistance}} clients are depicted in British, Danish and Swedish newspapers. The study {{is inspired by}} American media studies that have documented an overrepresentation of African Americans. It is <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> due <b>to</b> the institutional logics of liberal welfare regimes the negative stereotyping of poor and social assistance clients is resembled in Great Britain; {{despite the fact that}} the salience of the race issue has been modest in Britain. In contrast it is <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> due <b>to</b> the institutional logics of social democratic welfare regimes this negative stereotyping is less severe in Swedish and Danish newspapers; despite the fact that both countries have become multiethnic and the salience of the issue has been high in the Danish case.

Moreover, they altered the track of the E&CR line to narrow gauge, and informed the Commissioners <b>that</b> they proposed <b>to</b> start narrow gauge passenger services on the E&CR on 15 February 1848; this was to be from Crediton to Cowley Bridge just short of the B&ER.
