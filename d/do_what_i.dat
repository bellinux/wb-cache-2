5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{you spoke}} to Estella the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>done.</b> <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> <b>done!</b> <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> <b>done!</b> ...|$|R

The {{sound of the}} guns, {{and the thought of}} the {{fighting}} goads him to madness. <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> promised. Through me he has broken with the King, and I have sent him to you. The rest you should have accomplished." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done already.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{explained}} {{the lack of}} critical attention he received as follows: [...] "Guys who <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am doing are viewed as passé." [...] He also contrasted his own approach with that of performers who produced [...] "interview music": [...] "something that's obviously different, {{and you get the}} interviews and a certain amount of attention." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was also}} {{discreet}} about his {{religious and political}} beliefs, but {{it is known that}} he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: [...] "The less you know about me the more interesting it will be to watch me <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do".|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{would have}} {{happened}} without the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I believe in this." [...] What they were saying was: [...] "It's a load of shite. I'm going to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do and I don't care what people think." [...] That {{was the key to}} it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant. People paint me {{as some kind of}} black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am doing. It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Until {{you spoke}} to her the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>done.</b> <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> <b>done!</b> <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> done!"

500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Commercially, {{the song}} had limited success, {{reaching}} number 27 on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to peak at 99 Billboard Hot 100. Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do. Sometimes you have to step back and get off the wheel. I didn't have control of the entire creative process. A lot of [...] artists trust me enough and allow me to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know is best to do as a producer".|$|E
500|$|His second solo studio record, I See Things Upside Down (2004), {{generated}} mixed reviews. [...] All {{marketing to}} the typical Christian music stations used by his first solo album and his albums with Caedmon's Call was stopped, though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics. [...] In comparison to Webb's previous work, this album has what's {{been referred to as}} an [...] "experimental" [...] style to it, and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect. Webb has stated that the album [...] "was doing away with people's expectations in order to free me up to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." [...] Following the release of I See Things Upside Down, Webb released a live concert DVD, How to Kill and Be Killed (2005).|$|E

500|$|On joining Walsall as a 19-year-old, Davis {{described}} himself as [...] "the type of player who likes to break things down and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call the 'nitty-gritty'. I like to get stuck in and work hard". He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition". Lee Clark suggested he looks best when using his power and strength and keeping {{his use of the}} ball simple. Dean Saunders mentioned his [...] "winning mentality"; according to the Birmingham Mail Brian Dick, [...] "when Blues are down no-one leads by example quite as much as Davis".|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say, and I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E

I may have succeeded; I may not. You may know it; you may not. I give no opinion. I have endured everything here but humiliation. That I have happily been spared--until this day.' ...|$|R

500|$|The {{official}} {{video was}} premiered on April 12, 2013. [...] "Blessed and grateful to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>i</b> do #AllAroundTheWorld. Thanks", he wrote linking to the video. It is a [...] "tour video" [...] which is entirely composed of Bieber showing {{his point of}} view while he is touring the world and is largely based on his performance over Mexico City. It also illustrates vistas from the places he visited and documents national monuments including the Elizabeth Tower, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, Taj Mahal, Giza pyramid complex, the Colosseum and Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. Ludacris, joins Bieber in the video during the rap portion of the song. It also included images of the singer posing with fans, and others crying and screaming for him.|$|E
500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|Numerous hip hop {{fans and}} certain rappers mocked West for {{becoming}} [...] "sappy" [...] while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons {{were drawn to}} Electric Circus, an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating [...] "I love it. I'mma tell you, as an artist, you wanna be free. I'mma <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel. You can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called 808s and Heartbreak, you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I think the people are ready for it." ...|$|E
