5|$|Born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon in Springfield, Illinois, Barrow {{worked as}} a {{journalist}} and soap salesman before entering the business of baseball by selling concessions at games. From there, Barrow purchased minor league baseball teams, also serving as team manager, and {{served as president of}} the Atlantic League. After managing the Tigers in 1903 and 1904 and returning to the minor leagues, Barrow became disenchanted with baseball, and left the game to operate a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, {{traveled}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 2007, the Wreck was {{involved}} in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> car trailer. The trailer failed while carrying the Wreck, in turn causing the truck and trailer to run {{off the road and}} into the roadside ditch. The Wreck fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to its side and roof. Despite the severe body damage (in excess of $30,000), the Wreck was repaired for {{the first game of the}} 2007 season against the Samford Bulldogs.|$|E

25|$|New Indies Style {{employed}} {{the use of}} the 'double facade' concept which manifested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> gallery. The covered gallery is implemented not only in the ground level but also at the second floor. Double facade protects the facade from heavy rainfall and strong sunlight, an important feature of tropical design. Extensive openings in the form of multiple doors or high windows were done to allow cross ventilation to cool the interior.|$|E
25|$|A Brown truss {{is a type}} of bridge truss, used in covered bridges. It {{is noted}} for its {{economical}} use of materials, taking the form of a box truss. There may be vertical or almost vertical tension members, but there are no vertical members in compression. In practice, when used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> bridge, the most common application, the truss is protected with outside sheathing. The Brown Truss was invented and patented by Josiah Brown Jr. in 1857.|$|E

25|$|Their reign lasted {{just seven}} years when Thibaw Min was {{defeated}} in the Third Anglo-Burmese War and forced to abdicate by the British in 1885. On 25 November 1885 they were taken away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> carriage, leaving Mandalay Palace by the southern gate of the walled city along the streets lined by British soldiers and their wailing subjects, to the River Irrawaddy where a steamboat called Thuriya (Sun) awaited. Thibaw was 27 and Supayalat 26.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} was to melt the fritted {{material}} in crucibles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> furnace to give molten glass. The furnace needed {{to operate at}} as high a temperature as possible since quick melting {{and the need for}} less flux improved the quality of glass. The change from natron to potash required an increase in melting temperature of about 200°C to around 1350°C, necessitating a fundamental change in furnace technology and the development of high-temperature ceramics. At this higher temperature, normal clay would react chemically with the glass.|$|E
25|$|By 1973, {{the railway}} station with its 10 {{platforms}} was deemed too large and was again rebuilt, {{this time on}} a different site slightly further south. The old Exchange station was demolished soon afterwards and was used for a time as a car park; the site now houses Bradford Crown Court and is due to be developed as a 'Justice Quarter' with new Magistrates' and Coroner's Courts. In 1977, a bus station was built alongside, and, in 1983, the station was renamed Bradford Interchange to link buses and trains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> environment.|$|E

25|$|On October 14, at 9:15p.m., 47-year-old Linda Franklin (née Moore), an FBI {{intelligence}} {{analyst who}} was a resident of Arlington County, Virginia, was shot dead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> parking lot at Home Depot {{with her husband in}} Fairfax County, Virginia, just outside Falls Church at Seven Corners Shopping Center. The police received {{what seemed to be a}} very good lead after the October 14 shooting, but it was later determined that the witness was inside the Home Depot at the time and was lying. The witness was subsequently arrested for interfering with the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Its other notable {{geographic}} {{feature is}} {{its proximity to}} the lowest site of subjugation of the River Forth. Control of the bridge brought military advantage in times of unrest and; excise duty, or pontage dues in peacetime. Unsurprisingly excise men were installed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> booth in {{the centre of the}} bridge to collect tax from any entering the royal burgh with goods. Stirling remained the river's lowest reliable crossing point (that is, without a weather-dependent ferry or seasonal ford) until the construction of the Alloa Swing Bridge between Throsk and Alloa in 1885.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{occurred}} at the Sofa Super Store, composed of a 42,000ft² (3,902 m²) single-story steel trussed showroom building with a 17,000ft² (1,579 m²) warehouse building located behind the retail space, located at 1807 Savannah Highway in Charleston. The building had no fire sprinkler system. The fire started at approximately 7:00p.m. <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> loading dock area built between the showroom and warehouse buildings which was attached to both buildings. At the time, the business was open and employees were present. Charleston firefighters {{arrived on the scene}} within three minutes of the alarm, followed soon after by firefighters from the St. Andrews Public Service District.|$|E

25|$|A {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} was built with a 4.02inch (102mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> control cabin on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|E
25|$|However, his {{religious}} convictions {{caused him to}} spurn the Hồ Chí Minh-led Viet Minh independence movement, which was strongly atheist. Although he was ambitious, Tuyến was aware of his provincial accent and his manner of stumbling over long words, which was {{not considered to be}} consistent with the archetypal leader with a city accent. In 1946, while still a student, Tuyến came to know the Ngô family by chance. His future mentor Ngô Đình Nhu wanted to travel from Hanoi to a Catholic area near the border with Laos and needed a guide. A Catholic priest asked Tuyến to lead the way on a bicycle while Nhu followed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> cyclo to evade French colonial and Vietminh attention.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the days}} of O'Connell a larger public {{demonstration}} has not been witnessed than that of Sunday last. About 1 o'clock the monster procession started from Claremorris, headed by several thousand men on foot – the men of each district wearing a laural leaf or green ribbon in hat or coat to distinguish the several contingents. At 11 o'clock a monster contingent of tenant-farmers on horseback drew {{up in front of}} Hughes's hotel, showing discipline and order that a cavalry regiment might feel proud of. They were led on in sections, each having a marshal who kept his troops well in hand. Messrs. P.W. Nally, J.W. Nally, H. French, and M. Griffin, wearing green and gold sashes, led on their different sections, who rode two deep, occupying, at least, over an Irish mile of the road. Next followed a train of carriages, brakes, cares, etc. led on by Mr. Martin Hughes, the spirited hotel proprietor, driving a pair of rare black ponies to a phæton, taking Messrs. J.J. Louden and J. Daly. Next came Messrs. O'Connor Power, J. Ferguson, and Thomas Brennan <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> carriage, followed by at least 500 vehicles from the neighbouring towns. On passing through Ballindine the sight was truly imposing, the endless train directing its course to Irishtown – a neat little hamlet on the boundaries of Mayo, Roscommon, and Galway.|$|E
500|$|According to British naval {{historian}} Richard Compton-Hall, {{the problems}} of achieving neutral buoyancy would have rendered the vertical propeller useless. The route Turtle {{would have had to}} take to attack Eagle was slightly across the tidal stream which would, in all probability, have resulted in Lee becoming exhausted. [...] In the face of these and other problems, Compton-Hall suggests the entire story was fabricated as disinformation and morale-boosting propaganda, and if Lee did carry out an attack it was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> rowing boat rather than Turtle.|$|E

The specially built ship hall had been visited by over seven million visitors as of 2007, since it first opened on [...] 1983, just under a year after it was successfully raised.|$|E
