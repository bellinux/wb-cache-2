5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – {{the difference between}} the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by Doppler shifts as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine the aircraft's speed and <b>heading,</b> but multiple combinations of speed and <b>heading</b> can be valid solutions.|$|E

5|$|Delaware Route 404 Truck (DE 404 Truck) is a truck bypass of {{the section}} of DE 404 through Georgetown.
