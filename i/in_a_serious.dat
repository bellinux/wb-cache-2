5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Alec Sulkin and {{directed}} by Dominic Bianchi. This episode generated significant controversy from various media organizations and critics for its portrayal of domestic violence, which, unusually for Family Guy, is portrayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> manner, and received negative critical reviews. An estimated 5.97 million homes viewed the episode in its original airing according to Nielsen ratings.

5|$|Between March and June 1944 Raithel {{commanded}} his regiment during {{several major}} operations, including {{what may have}} been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of the war, Operation Maibaum (Maypole).

On 11 June 1944, he was recommended for an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment, but it was not approved. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944, the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone.|$|E

As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E
5|$|Local rebel commanders were {{generally}} suspicious of outside Arab military leaders, such as al-Qawuqji, {{and of the}} AHC, particularly after {{many members of the}} latter joined the Damascus-based Central Committee of Jihad following the AHC's dissolution by the authorities in October 1937. The Central Committee had been founded in late 1937 by Izzat Darwaza, and officially served as the revolt's political leadership, fundraising body and arms supplier. On the ground in Palestine, competition for the role of the rebels' general command became increasingly tense between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq. They engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> rivalry, which coincided with acrimonious relations between their families over influence in the Tulkarm area's social and political spheres.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E
