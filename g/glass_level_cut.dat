40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to compare and quantify the simulated effects of noise, index errors, and photometric level errors on four different optical monitoring layer termination strategies. A computer program to simulate optical thin film monitoring has been written for this work. These four termination methods are: photometric <b>cut</b> <b>level,</b> two types of turning point termination, and percent change from the extrema of the last maximum and minimum in the optical monitoring curve (POEM). The turning point termination algorithms which have been implemented are described briefly. A 4 -layer antireflection coating design has been simulated to find its possibilities and limitations, and to quantify the effects. The <b>level</b> <b>cut</b> strategy works well if the noise is low and the errors in index and photometric scale are small; however, systematic errors are a problem for <b>level</b> <b>cuts</b> {{in the presence of}} index and/or photometric scale errors. All of the other strategies are insensitive to index and/or photometric scale errors. It was found that two the turning point strategies work reasonably well from the turning point to points beyond that. The POEM strategy is robust and insensitive to errors when it is used beyond a ~ 5 % difference from the photometric level of the turning point...|$|R
