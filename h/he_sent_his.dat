5|$|Ban Chao (d.AD 102) {{enlisted the}} aid of the Kushan Empire, occupying the area of modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana. When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises (r.c.90–c.100 AD) for a {{marriage}} alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> forces to Wakhan (Afghanistan) to attack Ban Chao. The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies. In AD 91, the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao.|$|E
5|$|Brakk was {{a primal}} zerg pack leader on Zerus. When Sarah Kerrigan arrived on Zerus, Brakk {{declared}} that her zerg intruded on his territory. Wishing {{to stop her}} from waking Zurvan, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> pack to destroy the quillgor meat that her drones were harvesting. When this was unsuccessful, he personally led an attack on her hive cluster and was killed. The remnants of Brakk's pack were destroyed shortly afterwards by Yagdra's pack.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|Christian Georgia was {{repeatedly}} attacked starting in 1220, and in 1243 Queen Rusudan formally {{submitted to the}} Mongols, turning Georgia into a vassal state which then became a regular ally in the Mongol military conquests. Hethum I of Cilician Armenia submitted in 1247, and over the following years encouraged other monarchs {{to enter into a}} Christian-Mongol alliance. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum, and Sempad's positive letters about the Mongols were influential in European circles.|$|E

5|$|The {{attacks on}} the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} {{a major threat to}} Ecgfrith's suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} his {{marriage}} and the defeats of the Holy League diminished Sigismund's self-confidence. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> envoys to RudolphII and again offered to abdicate in September 1597. An agreement regarding his abdication was signed on 23December 1597. RudolphII granted Sigismund the Silesian duchies of Racibórz and Opole and a yearly subsidy of 50,000 thalers. The agreement was kept secret for months.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to capture}} Warsaw by a frontal assault, von Diebitsch devised {{a plan to}} outflank it and enter the city from the west. In early 1831 <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> forces {{upstream}} on the Vistula, where the Russian divisions were to cross the river and head back north, towards Warsaw. The new plan was thwarted by the Polish defence in three successive battles around Wawer, Dębe Wielkie and Iganie. The Russians withdrew towards Siedlce, where von Diebitsch fell ill and died of cholera.|$|E

5|$|When {{the smoke}} cleared, Heydrich {{emerged from the}} {{wreckage}} with his gun in his hand; he chased Kubiš and tried to return fire. Kubiš jumped on his bicycle and pedaled away. Heydrich ran after him for half a block but became weak from shock and collapsed. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> driver, Klein, to chase Gabčík on foot. In the ensuing firefight, Gabčík shot Klein in the leg and escaped to a local safe house. Heydrich, still with pistol in hand, gripped his left flank, which was bleeding profusely.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> brother to the capital of New Spain to ask for help, and then retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony. By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E
5|$|All of Sigismund's {{attempts}} {{to make peace with}} the sultan failed. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> envoys to Prague to negotiate with RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could make peace with the Ottomans with the assistance of Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took {{advantage}} of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chaceldon and later executed in Cappadocia. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> son to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1944 a train {{carrying}} 700 men on Schindler's {{list was}} initially {{sent to the}} concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men spent about a week before being re-routed to the factory in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of {{being sent to the}} gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|Reshef maneuvered his brigade as planned, {{entering}} into the previously discovered gap without any opposition. Leaving a combined recon and paratrooper {{force at the}} canal, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>his</b> tanks north and west to secure the flank of the projected crossing site and clear the Akavish and Tirtur roads from behind for the follow-on bridging equipment. He seized the Lakekan and Matzmed fortifications without resistance. Reshef informed Sharon that the forts were under control and that Akavish was clear. Sharon in turn informed Southern Command of these successes, sending a wave of jubilation through the Israeli commanders, delighted that the operation had begun so smoothly.|$|E
5|$|The {{ending of}} his novel had brought Achebe to the {{attention}} of military personnel, who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup.

They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede.|$|E
