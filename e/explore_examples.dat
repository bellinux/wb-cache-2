In this review, we <b>explore</b> <b>examples</b> of published methods (1952 - 2014) for isolating lipids from biological samples and attempt to assess the limits of techniques both from a chemical and biological perspective.

We <b>explore</b> <b>examples</b> of the ways indigenous and non-indigenous people use the Phips Proclamation to illustrate past violence directed against Indigenous peoples. This exploration is enhanced with an analysis of the re-introduction of the Phips Proclamation using concepts of decolonization theory...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{imposing a}} UV cutoff into a simple AdS/QCD {{model of the}} rho mesons. The cutoff corresponds to the scale at which QCD moves from perturbative to non-perturbative behaviour, above which the gravity dual will itself become strongly coupled. Simply imposing a cutoff significantly improves the fit to the masses of the tower of excited rho mesons. Formally one should match the couplings of higher dimension operators and the anomalous dimensions of fields to the QCD values at the cutoff. We <b>explore</b> <b>examples</b> of these matchings including looking at the anomalous dimensions of the ¯qγ µ q operators and including a GTrF 4 coupling...|$|E
40|$|The user {{interface}} is, of course, {{a crucial part}} of a user’s experience with any piece of software. E-learning interface design is especially critical, as the learning effectiveness and interface design are substantially intertwined. I suggest in this paper that the design of an interface for an e-learning program should be determined by how people learn and the tasks they need to perform in the program. This is in contrast to other approaches which view the interface design process as separate from the learning design. In this paper I describe an approach to e-learning interface design that focuses on the goals, audience, and learning, and <b>explore</b> <b>examples</b> that demonstrate the success of this approach. 1...|$|E
