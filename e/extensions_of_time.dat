40|$|It is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} for construction projects to have applications for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Many problems are encountered in practice in the application and preparation <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims. A {{study was conducted to}} identify the main problems encountered in the application and assessment <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claim in selected construction projects in Malaysia. Three (3) case studies have been used 10 investigate the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> issues. Findings from the study revealed that local contractors usually fail to comply with the contract procedural requirements to submit timely notification of delay and have difficulty in demonstrating their entitlement for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The main problem faced by contract administrators is that contractors tend to "inflate" their <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> entitlement with the intention to maximise their claims. Adherence to the agreed procedure in preparing and evaluating of delay claims and the implementation of a set of agreed standardised delay analysis may help to minimize the frequency and impact of such problems...|$|R

2500|$|Today, {{the circuit}} justice for each circuit is {{responsible}} for dealing with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed by a single justice. These include applications for emergency stays (including stays of execution in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the All Writs Act arising from cases within that circuit, as well as routine requests such as requests for <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In the past, circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of habeas corpus, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal. Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it [...] "granted" [...] or [...] "denied" [...] or entering a standard form of order. However, the justice may elect to write an opinion—referred to as an in-chambers opinion—in such matters {{if he or she}} wishes.|$|E

5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth.

40|$|The {{efficient}} and effective management <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on complex construction projects (especially when concerned with the development and resolution <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims) has long been considered {{a major issue in}} construction contracts. Recent research has culminated in the production of a new standard form of contract drafted specifically as an attempt to overcome these issues. This research identifies the perceived critical success factors that are recommended to be included in, and addressed by the new standard form of construction contract in an attempt to alleviate these issues, and reviews a selection of Australian standard forms of construction contract for the presence of the perceived critical success factors. A review of current literature was carried out to identify the perceived critical success factors for the effective and efficient management <b>of</b> <b>time</b> with respect to <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims, together with a qualitative analysis of the new standard form of construction contract as verification of the identified critical success factors and their management and application. A comparative analysis was undertaken <b>of</b> the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> provisions <b>of</b> a selection of Australian standard forms of construction contract as a means of determining their efficiency and effectiveness for resolving <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims in a modern construction industry. The research identified 69 critical success factors that should be present in the clauses of standard forms of construction contracts to efficiently and effectively enable the resolution <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims for the benefit of all parties involved. The selected Australian standard forms of construction contract were found to be vague with respect to the content and inclusion of the perceived critical success factors, providing a greater opportunity for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claim to evolve into a dispute between the contracting parties...|$|R
