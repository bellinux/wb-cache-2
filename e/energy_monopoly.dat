The government should eliminate discrimination toward non-state-owned enterprises, lift limitations to market access in all industries, and channel private investment properly via policy measures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Caspian Sea and South Caucasus has become the focus of considerable international attention, primary because {{it is one of the}} oldest and potentially richest oil and gas producing areas in the world. The August 2008 Russian invasion of the Georgia and the unilateral recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia fundamentally changed the situation in the region. The war has created a new strategic situation. And the question is now how to handle this delicate situation in a strategically and geopolitically important region. So by controlling Georgia (in case Russia reaches abovementioned aims), Russia actually will be able to cut off Central Asia and Caspian resources. It means Russia would be able to isolate and cut off Azerbaijan and Central Asian countries and it will significantly strengthen its <b>energy</b> <b>monopoly</b> over Europe with all results coming out from that fact. So it’s about major shift in the energy policy and major shift in geopolitics based on this energy policy and Russian <b>energy</b> <b>monopoly.</b> The August war in Georgia demonstrated some risks associated with the functioning of the transit energy corridor in the southern Caucasus. It also demonstrated the need for broader security guarantees for a region that is vital to European and global energy security.

40|$|Eurasia is a {{major source}} of oil and natural gas, and events in the region have a great {{potential}} to destabilize global security patterns. Supplies of natural gas and oil from Eurasia are vital for the functioning of European economies, and also important to US efforts to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern energy resources. Presently, pipelines in Eurasia stretch across thousands of miles throughout unstable political regions. Disruptions in gas and oil supplies negatively affect the economies and politics of the region. Future pipeline projects ? such as the Nabucco pipeline ? are highly controversial, and Russia?s efforts to control oil and gas supplies in the region have recently intensified. Russia has gained increased influence in its neighborhood by consolidating control of regional energy production and infrastructure. This project claims that Russia is using its <b>energy</b> <b>monopoly</b> to further its geostrategic aims: ensuring political influence in nearby countries, obtaining a rise in commodity prices, and returning to multi-polarity in which Russia maintains clear regional hegemony. On the other hand, the US has four key interests in Eurasia. These include averting tensions with Russia, stabilizing the flow of oil and natural gas to Western Europe, maintaining US regional access for counterterrorism operations, and promoting democratic regimes to reduce Russian influence. In this light, the report argues that the US must promote development of pipelines that bypass Russian control and advance alternative domestic sources. These actions will ease European dependence on Russian energy, shield Europe from disruptions in supply, and decrease Russia?s ability to exert influence through energy policy. Other options include promoting a common European Union energy policy to increase influence in energy markets, push for increased gas storage across Europe to provide temporary relief against gas disruptions, and explore increased US and European cooperation with Russia on energy market access.

In 1937, the Bonneville Project Act was signed by Roosevelt, giving the dam's power over to the public and creating the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} links between Russia's disappointing growth {{performance}} {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s, its costly and unsuccessful stabilization, the macroeconomic meltdown of 1998, and the spectacular rise of non-payments. Non-payments flourished in an environment of fundamental inconsistency between a macroeconomic policy geared at sharp disinflation, and a microeconomic policy of bailing enterprises out through soft budget constraints. Heavy untargeted implicit subsidies flowing through the non-payments system (amounting to 10 percent of GDP annually) have stifled growth, contributed to the August 1998 meltdown, through their impact on public debt, and have made at best a questionable contribution to equity. Dismantling this system must be a top priority, along with promoting enterprise restructuring and growth (by hardening budget constraints) and medium-term macroeconomic stability (by reducing the size of subsidies). Getting the government out of the non-payments system means settling all appropriately controlled budgetary expenditures on time, and in cash, and eschewing spending arrears, thereby setting an example for enterprises, and laying the groundwork for eliminating tax offsets at all levels of government, and insisting on cash tax payments. To stop energy-related subsidies, would require not only that the government pay its own energy bills on time, and in cash, but also that the <b>energy</b> <b>monopolies</b> be empowered to disconnect non-paying clients. This will enable the government to insist that the <b>energy</b> <b>monopolies</b> in turn pay their own taxes in full, and on time.

40|$|This {{working paper}} explores issues of {{security}} integration {{in a number}} of external policies of the European Union (EU), and looks at both security policies per se and the security rationale contained in other policy contexts. Following a twin-track approach of presenting both a legal and a political assessment respectively, the contributions have been clustered around three themes: energy security and the EU’s relations with neighbouring states, the EU’s targeted sanctions policy, and security sector reform pursued by the EU in third countries. The first contribution on energy security seeks to clarify the EU’s energy dependency on Russia as a security concern and assesses the EU’s response, in particular the Energy Charter Treaty, to Russia’s strategic use of its new <b>energy</b> <b>monopoly.</b> The second paper focuses on the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and analyses a number of critiques with respect to energy policy {{in the context of the}} ENP. Within the targeted sanctions theme, one contribution discusses the legal complexities with respect to their adoption and implementation in the EU’s multilevel structure, whereas the other looks more broadly at their rationale and highlights a number of problems related to their strategic use by the EU and the UN. On the last theme, the notion of Security Sector Reform (SSR), the first contribution raises the issue in the context of the Western Balkans. While acknowledging the potential importance of EU leverage through membership conditionality, it argues that – for reasons both endogenous and exogenous to the EU’s SSR approach – accession is not an automatic best case scenario for sustainable reform in these countries. The second contribution looks at the EU’s SSR strategy in the light of local ownership and the quest for a holistic approach by examining the reframing of some existing policies and the adoption of new instruments and actions under the SSR agenda.

30|$|Heavy {{investment}} on energy resources {{is one of}} the reasons for the rapid economic growth we have witnessed in China since 2000. Excessive energy consumption growth strengthens China’s coal-dominated energy structure. Meanwhile, the supply of energy has been fully converted to net imports, weakening favorable factors for economic growth and increasing the risk of energy security. The nationalization level for the energy sector is much higher than for other industries. But even for state-owned enterprises, there is a huge gap in enterprise efficiency between different production processes. With a changing domestic and international energy market environment, China’s energy industry should switch from the speed-oriented model in the past and adjust obsolete mechanisms and policies.we must first focus more on developing the service industry and optimizing the structure of the manufacturing industry.Second, the government must use fewer short-term economic interventions.Third, we should strengthen external regulations on <b>energy</b> <b>monopolies.</b> Fourth, we should attach great importance to energy security.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to achieve}} more {{insight into the}} complex interplay between the "external" market {{regulations}} and "internal" regulations (corporate governance) of energy firms. In recent years, many countries have deregulated the incumbent <b>energy</b> <b>monopolies</b> and have introduced new modes of regulation. However, the new incentive schemes do not represent an unmitigated success story. A major problem {{seems to be the}} neoclassical framework that is used for the analysis of energy markets. Therefore, an important goal {{of this paper is to}} clarify the boundaries of neoclassical regulation theory. There are two restrictions that hamper the neoclassical analysis of energy markets. The first is the difficulty of overcoming the widely held "black box" view of firms. The second is the idea that agents always make rational choices. The paper proposes a kind of theoretical division of labor for understanding the effectiveness of regulatory schemes in energy markets. Neoclassical economics points out to the sources of market failure, and helps to identify where in particular on the supply chain one is likely to observe natural monopolies. Transaction cost economics explains appropriate governance of vertical relations along the supply chain. And organizational theories can elucidate what happens within firms: their response to regulation, competition, and relations with suppliers. A research agenda for the third component is proposed, drawing on insights from New Sociological Institutionalism and organizational behavior...|$|R
40|$|Regulation and {{the power}} {{industry}} are two increasingly often associated concepts. The first one means {{the supervision of the}} state, the second {{is one of the most}} important sectors of the economy. Regulation in the power industry is the reconciliation of the interests of power enterprises with the interest of the receivers who must use energy. Reconciliation of these contradictory interests is quite a task. Its realization is entrusted to the so-called regulator, a specially appointed organ of the state administration with special rights and autonomy. The legal foundations for undertaking actions of this kind in Poland were created by the Energy Law enacted on the 10 th April 1997. The article discusses both the questions of the legal-institutional foundations as well as the effects of applying Polish regulation solutions. A special place was taken by tariffing, that is, the use by the regulation organ of the possibility of influencing the establishment of prices in energy enterprises by connecting the price with the cost accepted by the regulator who must also take into consideration also the possibility of making real the payments of the final receivers. In the final part reflections were formulated referring to successes and failures which took place in the process of implementation of the idea of marketization of Polish <b>energy</b> <b>monopolies</b> which served the authors to formulate proposals of changes in the principles of regulation and its tools, which is dealt with in the next part of the article in the third number of Ekonomia. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review the history of the Russian fuel peat industry, analyse the {{prospects}} for its further development, and draw attention to its significant technical and economic potential. Russian peat resources represent more than 30 % of the global total. Peat production peaked during 1960 – 1980, when the volume of peat extraction was two orders of magnitude higher than it is now. The key factors that prevented further development of the Russian fuel peat industry were an inadequate regulatory framework for peat processing and the inability of peat extraction enterprises to overcome the <b>energy</b> supply <b>monopoly</b> of the coal, oil and gas industries. At present, the peat industry of the Russian Federation is in decline and its potential has been lost. Most of the power plants that previously operated on peat have been converted to coal and other fuels and, as a result, the occurrence of peatland fires has increased greatly. A case is made for revival of the industry to exploit peat as a local energy resource, employing modern processing techniques that can achieve full utilisation of the peat whilst reducing air pollution and generating little waste...|$|R
40|$|With the {{collapse}} of oil prices, shortages and long term increases in energy prices seem far away, and conservation {{is the last thing}} on our minds. Thus, national <b>energy</b> supply <b>monopolies</b> encourage the use rather than conservation of energy, whilst the alleged prospect of a long-term increase in electricity demand is used to justify investment in nuclear power. This article examines how decentralisation and a greater local involvement in national energy policy could overcome this contradiction. It also finds that the conservation strategies developed, after the oil crisis of the 1970 's, in several other countries have, surprisingly, no British equivalent. ENERGY EFFICIENCY YEAR: TRICK OR TREAT? Most people are completely unaware that the UK is Europe's most profligate energy user. Our position as the continent's largest fossil fuel reserve — the proverbial land of coal in a sea of oil is, of course, better known. Yet this abundance of supply is mirrored by a relative weakness of conservation effort. Analysis of the pattern of energy use now reveals that the downturn of energy demand, since the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, cannot be wholly ascribed to the loss of energy consuming industry. Increasing energy efficiency is also part of this decrease in overall energy demand. But in comparative terms, UK achievements pale into insignificance against the conservation drives of the Scandinavians and our main OEC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} between energies (fossil fuel and renewable) market and an international market for emission permits. The price of permits a¤ects the energy market equilibrium, which also alters the emission levels. With implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, Russia (the FSU) {{will be able to}} exert market power in the emission of permit. Hence, Russia faces a trade-o ¤ between maximising its permits revenue and preserving its rents from energy exports. Russia is most likely to adopt a strategic behaviour. Involving in the Kyoto protocol, the European Union (the EU) aims also to reach an e ¢ cient distribu-tion of its energy consumption based both on its energy exports and the development of its renewable energy. This paper analyses the interde-pendence of the energy and the emission permits markets using a general equilibrium approach. We show that the coordination of FSU strategies on the brown and the permits market a¤ects strategic behaviour on the energies market, which in turn impact the permits price and the environ-mental cost-e¤ectiveness. The impact depends crucially on the degree of substitutability between the brown and the green <b>energies.</b> A <b>monopoly</b> behaviour exerted by the FSU on the permits market leads to a sharp fall of the brown energy price if the green energy is a highly substitute with the brown, which induces also reduction of the FSU market shares on the energy market...|$|R

The market failures associated with investment decisions and environmental pollution will therefore again come to the fore.

40|$|The end of World War II {{ushered in}} a new era for Japan as a global {{economic}} powerhouse. The lost decade of the 1990 ’s coupled with the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 - 1998 and the Global Recession of 2008 - 2009 further complicated the already dire Japanese economic situation. To address the country’s protracted economic stagnation, Prime Minister Abe has resorted to the Keynesian approach known as “Abenomics ” which focuses on aggressive government spending in public works projects. The rationale behind this is that such investments will lead to creation of jobs needed to lift the economy out of stagnation. The paper starts off by recognizing that economic policies do not exist in a vacuum as there are several variables that impact on them. The essay posits that addressing the economic stagnation in Japan requires a holistic perspective as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Hence, political, social and cultural factors all have crucial roles to play in shaping the economic policies in Japan. The paper argues that each of these variables must be accorded utmost importance as economic reforms are not stand-alone policies. This research proposes some solutions some of which are: adoption of a points-based immigration system to attract skilled workers, raising the birth rate, introduction a more inclusive policy to encourage more participation of women in the work force, increasing foreign direct investment, opening up the country’s <b>energy,</b> breaking up <b>monopolies</b> and the implementation of medical insurance reforms that cater more to the needs of working women.
