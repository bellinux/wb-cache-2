25|$|Like other Ichthyosaurs, Temnodontosaurus {{species were}} fast cruisers or swimmers. Jurassic Ichthyosaurs, like Temnodontosaurus species, swim with lateral {{oscillation}} of their caudal fluke on a <b>flexible</b> <b>tail</b> stock. The body form for swimming of T. trigonodon were described by Emily Buchholtz. T. trigonodon species had highly flexible, long, thin bodies {{with a high}} vertebral count and modest regional differentiation. They used their large limbs as rudders. The style of swimming was thunniform (unlike the earlier Ichthyosaurs which did anguilliform styled swimming instead). This is shown in Temnodontosaurus and other forms in the Jurassic (and after) because of their semi-lunate tail fin and shortened body relative to the tail.|$|E
25|$|In January 1942, {{trials of}} the Rotachute Mark I were {{conducted}} to assess the aerodynamic characteristics while mounted on the truck-mounted rig, with pilot control of the aircraft in forward motion. On 11 February 1942, the prototype Rotachute was first manually flown from a wheeled trolley while under tow behind a Humber car at Ringway, after starting the rotor by hand. The pilot was Flt Lt I.M. Little, who had experience flying Avro/Cierva C.30 Rota autogiros on radar calibration duties; he was later awarded the Air Force Cross (UK). On that and on a subsequent trial, the machine rolled over after landing, sustaining damage to the blades {{but not to the}} pilot. A tethered test beneath a barrage balloon and a longer test flight at RAF Snaith were both more successful. The <b>flexible</b> <b>tail</b> section evidently offered inadequate directional stability, and the consequence was the Rotachute Mark II, that had a longer tail section braced with wooden formers, plus two landing wheels mounted below the centre of gravity.|$|E
500|$|Interestingly, Spinosaurus {{exhibited}} the anatomical features required to combine all three hunting strategies: a sail for herding prey more efficiently, {{as well as}} <b>flexible</b> <b>tail</b> and neck to slap the water for stunning, injuring or killing prey. The submerged dorsal sail would have provided a strong centreboard-like counterforce for powerful sidewards movements of the strong neck and long tail, as performed by sailfish (Domenici et al., 2014) or thresher sharks (Oliver et al., 2013). While smaller dorsal sails or fins make the dorsal water volume better accessible for slashing, it can be speculated that their smaller stabilization effect makes lateral slashing less efficient (e.g. for thresher sharks). Forming a hydrodynamic fulcrum and hydrodynamically stabilizing the trunk along the dorsoventral axis, Spinosaurus’ sail would also have compensated for the inertia of the lateral neck by tail movements and vice versa not only for predation but also for accelerated swimming. This behaviour might also have been one reason for Spinosaurus’ muscular chest and neck reported by Ibrahim et al. (2014). [...] " ...|$|E

60|$|But agonizing as was {{the wound}} of this whale, and an appalling {{spectacle}} enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire {{the rest of the}} herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh.

40|$|The segrosome of multiresistance plasmid TP 228 {{comprises}} ParF, {{which is}} a member of the ParA ATPase superfamily, and the ParG ribbon–helix– helix factor that assemble jointly on the parH centromere. Here we demonstrate that the distinct-ive parH site (100 -bp) consists of an array of de-generate tetramer boxes interspersed by AT-rich spacers. Although numerous consecutive AT-steps are suggestive of inherent curvature, parH lacks an intrinsic bend. Sequential deletion of parH tetra-mers progressively reduced centromere function. Nevertheless, the variant subsites could be rearranged in different geometries that accommodated centromere activity effectively re-vealing that the site is highly elastic in vivo. ParG cooperatively coated parH: proper centromere binding necessitated the protein’s N-terminal <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> which modulate the centromere binding affinity of ParG. Interaction of the ParG ribbon–helix–helix domain with major groove bases in the tetramer boxes likely provides direct readout of the centromere. In contrast, the AT-rich spacers may be implicated in indirect readout that mediates cooperativity between ParG dimers assembled on adjacent boxes. ParF alone does not bind parH but instead loads into the segrosome interactively with ParG, thereby subtly altering centromere conform-ation. Assembly of ParF into the complex requires the N-terminal <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> in ParG that are con-tacted by ParF...|$|R

40|$|Binding {{of a small}} {{molecule}} to a macromolecular target reduces its conformational freedom, {{resulting in}} a negative entropy change that opposes the binding. The goal {{of this study is}} to estimate the configurational entropy change of two minor-groove-binding ligands, netropsin and distamycin, upon binding to the DNA duplex d(CGCGAAAAACGCG) ·d(CGCGTTTTTCGCG). Configurational entropy upper bounds based on 10 -ns molecular dynamics simulations of netropsin and distamycin in solution and in complex with DNA in solution were estimated using the covariance matrix of atom-positional fluctuations. The results suggest that netropsin and distamycin lose a significant amount of configurational entropy upon binding to the DNA minor groove. The estimated changes in configurational entropy for netropsin and distamycin are − 127 J K− 1 mol− 1 and − 104 J K− 1 mol− 1, respectively. Estimates of the configurational entropy contributions of parts of the ligands are presented, showing that the loss of configurational entropy is comparatively more pronounced for the <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> than for the relatively rigid central body...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe vast {{majority}} of phages, bacterial viruses, possess a tail ensuring host recognition, cell wall perforation and safe viral DNA transfer from the capsid to the host cytoplasm. Long <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> are formed from the tail tube protein (TTP) polymerised as hexameric rings around and stacked along the tape measure protein (TMP).

Pb 6 is unusual in forming a trimeric ring, although structure analysis reveals homology with all classical TTPs and related tube proteins of bacterial puncturing devices (type VI secretion system and R-pyocin). Structures of T 5 tail tubes before and after interaction with the host receptor were determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 6 [*]Å resolution.

Small-sized bio-inspired robots can mimic flagellar propulsion mecha-nisms of microorganisms for actuation in microfluidic environ-ments, which are dominated by viscous forces. Microorganisms propel themselves {{by means of the}} motion of their flagella such as rotation of rigid helices or travelling planar waves on <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> similar to whipping motion. Here, we present characteriza-tion of swimming of onboard-powered autonomous robots inside cylindrical tubes. Robots consist of two links, head and tail, con-nected with a revolute joint. Rigid helical tails of the swimmer robots are made of steel wires with 12 different configurations of helical radius and pitch. From experiments forward linear veloc-ity of robots and angular velocities of the links are measured, and compared with the mathematical model, which is based on the resistive force theory. Results indicate that the motion of the swimmer inside channels can be predicted by means of the resis-tive force theory reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} lipids in which a head group, characterized by its volume, is attached to two <b>flexible</b> <b>tails</b> of equal length. The phase diagram of the anhydrous lipid is obtained within self-consistent field theory, and displays, {{as a function of}} lipid architecture, a progression of phases: body-centered cubic, hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar. We then examine mixtures of an inverted hexagonal forming lipid and a lamellar forming lipid. As the volume fractions of the two lipids vary, we find that inverted hexagonal, gyroid, or lamellar phases are formed. We demonstrate that the non-lamellar forming lipid is found preferentially at locations which are difficult for the lipid tails to reach. Variations in the volume fraction of each type of lipid tail are on the order of one to ten per cent within regions dominated by the tails. We also show that the variation in volume fraction is correlated qualitatively with the variation in mean curvature of the head-tail interface.
