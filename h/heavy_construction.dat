5|$|As the {{organization}} of the Army changed following Vietnam, the 20th Engineer Brigade was again reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina as an airborne brigade on 21 June 1974. Assigned as a subordinate command of the XVIII Airborne Corps, which comprised one airborne combat engineer battalion, a <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> battalion and four separate companies. Additionally, the 283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis) provided terrain intelligence needs of the brigade's mission. Since that time the brigade and its subordinate units supported the XVIII Airborne Corps, fulfilling critical combat engineer, construction, topographic, and bridging missions.|$|E
5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> equipment and sought {{to capitalize on the}} passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass and Lomax {{then turn}} to {{journalist}} Jimmy Hall (Sid James), who is skeptical of their story but asks to visit Winnerden Flats. At {{the local community}} centre, they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> and other work at the complex. The mood changes, however, {{when one of the}} meteorite-missiles crashes through the building roof, injuring barmaid Sheila (Vera Day). Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press. The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fire, the {{government}} of Madagascar established the Direction nationale des opérations Rova (DNOR, or National Office of Rova Operations), a body directed by four national experts within Madagascar's Ministry of Culture who were tasked with developing and overseeing plans for {{the reconstruction of the}} Rova. Two years after the fire, several key milestones in the process had been achieved, with objects recovered from the fire inventoried, site excavations completed, preliminary restoration plans for Manjakamiadana developed, and work on the royal chapel initiated. A ramp was also built to enable site access for the necessary <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> vehicles. Prior to work commencing, a traditional ceremony was performed to restore the sanctity of the site, which had served a dual role as both a physical tomb and spiritual link to venerated ancestors.|$|E

25|$|The {{line was}} {{scheduled}} for completion in December 2002, but due to various problems in the automation, the opening was repeatedly delayed. It was finally opened on 20 June 2003, with higher fares than existing lines supposedly {{to compensate for the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> costs (S$4.6billion).|$|E
25|$|After using longer {{trains and}} running trains at 75 second headways, the next option {{would be to}} {{lengthen}} the station platforms to accommodate longer trains. This expansion option {{would be the most}} expensive as it would require <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> at all Expo Line stations.|$|E
25|$|The route {{was changed}} to 63rd Street because {{officials}} of the Rockefeller Institute at 64th Street feared that <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> and later train movements {{so close to the}} Institute's buildings might have adversely affected delicate instruments at the Institute and change the accuracy of the research being conducted.|$|E
50|$|Issues {{also include}} the {{sustainability}} of building materials. Earth sheltering often requires <b>heavier</b> <b>construction</b> than conventional building techniques, and many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs.|$|R

50|$|Industrial gas {{turbines}} differ from aeronautical designs {{in that the}} frames, bearings, and blading are of <b>heavier</b> <b>construction.</b> They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power— often an electric generator—and the secondary-energy equipment {{that is used to}} recover residual energy (largely heat).|$|R
25|$|The {{availability}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> equipment would facilitate alternative energy projects, {{such as the}} construction of larger wind turbines, a tidal power plant or a dam with a hydro-power station in one of St Helena's valleys. Limitations in cargo size of RMS St Helena and the un{{availability of}} a large crane prohibit construction of larger wind turbines.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the limited}} traffic along the Solør Line, the {{stations}} have not been subject to repeated expansions and changes like many other lines. They therefore represent a unique heritage of authentic Swiss chalet style buildings from a period with <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> of railways. Roverud, Nor, Grinder, and Flisa have all been listed, as has the water tower at Jømna.|$|E
25|$|Cursor also {{produced}} construction and farm vehicles. One brand reproduced was Kramer tractors, one made in plastic, {{and also a}} Kramer backhoe/shovel. A Fendt Favorit tractor was also made. The trucks and <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> equipment were very similar to NZG and Conrad, though Cursor never matched their dizzying productivity. In fact, after producing about 40 different models over 18 years, Cursor seems to have produced nothing more after about 1987.|$|E

25|$|VanderSloot was {{the owner}} of HighStone (formerly Eagle Rock Construction; RBH Gravel; VIP Construction), an Idaho Falls-based asphalt {{construction}} and maintenance company. HighStone was the prime contractor on a $421,000 state government contract to repair a stretch of Idaho State Highway 33 in Idaho Falls, and worked on a road project in Rexburg. In September 2011, HighStone merged with DePatco, a family-owned <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> company in St. Anthony, Idaho. The merger created eastern Idaho's largest locally owned construction company.|$|E
25|$|Believing Mayne's {{troops to}} {{be a serious}} threat, Victor marched against him. The Loyal Lusitanian Legion {{battalion}} defended the Alcántara Bridge for three hours. Then, the French artillery silenced their guns and a supporting battalion of militia took to its heels. The bridge was mined, but when Mayne ordered the charges to be detonated, its <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> withstood the explosion. Victor's infantry then rushed the incompletely demolished span. The French hung around the area for a few days but finally withdrew. The next action was the Battle of Talavera.|$|E

25|$|The former {{shipyard}} {{served as}} a port for commuter boats to Boston run by Harbor Express for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This service was discontinued in 2013 when a dock in Quincy was severely damaged. Currently, {{there are no plans}} to revive this service. The yard is also used by Jay Cashman, Inc., for <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> and marine equipment services, by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as a sewage sludge heat-drying and pelletizing facility, and by Fore River Transportation Corporation for short line freight rail service to CSXT South Braintree. The yard has also been used as the main construction area for the new Fore River Bridge, which is located adjacent to the property.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)- {{which was}} slow in {{accepting}} diesels- {{finally decided to}} retire its steam fleet, which was {{the largest in the}} world at that time, and buy a large order of diesels. Baldwin bid, expecting its lifelong loyal customer to help keep Baldwin in business by buying at least some Baldwin diesels. General Motors' EMD division, however, gave the PRR an exceptional deal on new, reliable GP9s, so the PRR— which was in a financial pinch itself— sent the business to GM. This one lost deal proved {{to be the end of}} the line, and—after 125 years of continuous production—Baldwin closed most of its Eddystone plant. It produced no more locomotives after 1956, instead concentrating on <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> equipment. More than 70,500 locomotives had been produced when production ceased in 1956.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} 100 days in office as governor, he {{proposed}} {{expansion of the}} beverage container deposit law (bottle bill), a switch by state government agencies {{to the use of}} environmentally friendly cleansers, and clean up of the state's “Filthy Five” power plants. He appointed a prominent environmentalist, Douglas Foy, to oversee energy development, transportation, housing, and environmental affairs. Foy helped develop an energy and environment plan that included 72 public and private initiatives, with a goal of deriving 15 percent of the state’s electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and nonpolluting fuel cells by 2020, and of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of state agencies by 25 percent. The plan also proposed to impose strict emissions standards on older power plants and sought to substantially reduce soot emissions from diesel buses, trucks, and <b>heavy</b> <b>construction</b> equipment.|$|E
50|$|Several {{plans were}} {{considered}} and {{compared with the}} original Spanish plans. It was finally decided that for all structures, except for the tower, a different construction would be used, instead of the heavy masonry buildings in the Spanish design, modern reinforced concrete structures would be erected. This construction would be lighter, require less material, and therefore be more economical and still be fully as strong and permanent as the <b>heavier</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|R
