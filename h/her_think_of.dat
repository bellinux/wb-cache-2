Among {{them is a}} story listed as [...] "boobrie as tarbh uisge". The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death {{at the side of}} Loch nan Dobhran, on the west coast of Argyll. Some months later, Phemie, Eachann's girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Murdoch, her former paramour.

60|$|Phoebe {{tried to}} make <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Robert, but she was exhausted, dozed, and {{was never able to}} speak so much again.|$|E
60|$|That warning {{effectively}} checked her. Yet certain stirrings {{of conscience}} made <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the man who}} had imperilled himself for her sake and her brother's.|$|E

6000|$|Ethel sat meditating, {{and at last}} said, [...] "I wish I had {{not told}} you! I don't always believe it myself, and it is so unkind, and you will make {{yourself}} unhappy too.

6000|$|... "Well, then!" [...] He rose, {{leaving his}} supper untasted, {{and went into}} the sitting-room, where she {{presently}} found him, with that everlasting confusion of papers before him on the desk.

6000|$|I {{found the}} next day she was {{wonderful}} inquisitive about this gentleman; the description I had given her of him, his dress, his person, his face, everything concurred to make <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a gentleman whose character she knew, and family too.
