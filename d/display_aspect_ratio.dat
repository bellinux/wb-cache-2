Notably one of the few popular <b>display</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> narrower than 4:3, and one popularised by business (CAD, DTP) rather than entertainment use, as it is well-suited to full-page layout editing. Historically, 5:4 was also the original <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of early 405-line television broadcasts, which progressed to a wider 4:3 as the idea of broadcasting cinema films gained traction.|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, {{to avoid}} confusion, {{it can be}} assumed that video editing {{products}} never ask for the Storage Aspect Ratio as they can directly retrieve or calculate it. Nonsquare-pixel-aware applications also need only to ask for either Pixel Aspect Ratio or <b>Display</b> <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio,</b> from either of which they can calculate the other.|$|E
50|$|Storage Aspect Ratio is {{the ratio}} of the image width to height in pixels, and can be easily {{calculated}} from the video file. <b>Display</b> <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> is {{the ratio of}} image width to height (in a unit of length such as centimeters or inches) when displayed on screen, and is calculated from the combination of Pixel Aspect Ratio and Storage Aspect Ratio.|$|E

50|$|The {{estimation}} of the monitor size by the distance between opposite corners {{does not take into}} account the <b>display</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> so that for example a 16:9 21 in widescreen display has less area, than a 21 in 4:3 screen. The 4:3 screen has dimensions of 16.8 × 12.6 in and area 211 sq in, while the widescreen is 18.3 × 10.3 in, 188 sq in.|$|E
