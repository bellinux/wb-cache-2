40|$|One Thousand and One Nights {{is one of}} the {{multinational}} literary works in which women have an obvious active presence. The protagonist is an astute and shrewd woman whose wise stories lead despotic king to a state of self-consciousness. Shahrzadâs storytelling in thousand and one nights and comparison of the themes of the stories via their morphological and constituting components show that she has tactfully stepped in rescuing her female compatriots and performing this <b>humanitarian</b> <b>task.</b> Studying the stories according to the correlation between their components has remarkably assisted the perception of Shahrzadâs storytelling dexterity. This study shows that the procedure in â 1001 nightsâ stories is the repetition of two episodes in the entry which is the story of Shahriar and his brother Shahzaman. This projection takes a gradual development in a way that in some stories womenâs betrayal is reflected (including Shahriar and Shahzamanâs traitor wives) and in other stories storytelling is done by one of the characters to save the lives of others (such as Sahrzadâs storytelling). Womenâs being in action is depicted by Shahrzad and other narrators as powerful, cunning and magical characters which makes a skilful proportion in storytelling and brings a gradual rise in the status of women after 1001 nights. Even {{at the end of the}} stories and in her short speech with Shahriar, Shahrzad intelligently adopts a treatment behavior which exactly conforms to the principles of psychology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Just after Cyclone Nargis {{struck the}} coast of Myanmar on 2 and 3 May 2008, the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Dr Surin Pitsuwan, called on all Member States to provide urgent relief {{assistance}} through {{the framework of the}} ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER). A few days later, the Government of the Union of Myanmar agreed to work in coordination with the ASEAN Secretariat to assemble and deploy an ASEAN-Emergency Rapid Assessment Team (ERAT), made up of Government officials and disaster management experts from ASEAN Member States. In the first ever such mission for ASEAN, the ASEAN-ERAT was deployed to Myanmar from 9 to 18 May 2008. Its report was submitted to the Special ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on 19 May 2008 in Singapore. At the meeting, the Foreign Ministers agreed to establish an ASEAN-led coordinating mechanism to “facilitate the effective distribution and utilisation of assistance from the international community, including the expeditious and effective deployment of relief workers, especially health and medical personnel. ” The result was a two-tiered structure, consisting of the ASEAN <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>Task</b> Force for the Victims of Cyclone Nargis (AHTF), and a Yangon-based Tripartite Core Group (TCG), consisting of ASEAN, the Government and the United Nations (UN), to facilitate day-to-day operations and oversee coordination. The constructive solution that was worked out, that of a tripartite structure involving ASEAN, the UN and the Government, turned out to be not only a successful formula for ensuring access, but also an effective forum for achieving a close and productive relationship with the authorities. This did not exist to the same degree before Nargis. As a result, there was significantly more humanitarian space in the Delta than in any other part of the country, and the TCG {{played a key role in}} securing this. This is relevant for Myanmar, as it paved the way for access for information collection in a country where otherwise little was known. All assessments and monitoring exercises were conducted with full access permitted by the Government. This was almost unprecedented for Myanmar. This book documents the types of assessments and monitoring exercises that were carried out under the auspices of the AHTF and TCG, including the deployment of the ASEAN-ERAT; the Post-Nargis Joint Assessment (PONJA) consisting of the Village Tract Assessment (VTA) and the Damage and Loss Assessment (DALA); the Periodic Review (PR) monitoring assessments that followed the PONJA; and the Social Impact Monitoring (SIM) studies. It also includes a section on the Recovery Information Accountability System (RIAS), which tracks funding streams from pledges to outputs received during the Post-Nargis and Regional Partnership Conference (PONAC) on 25 November 2009...|$|E

These aircraft were operated by Italian Air Force personnel temporarily flying for the Order, carried the Order's roundels on the fuselage and Italian ones on the wings, and were used mainly for standard Italian Air Force training and transport missions but also for some <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tasks</b> proper of the Order of Malta (like the transport of sick pilgrims to the Lourdes sanctuary). In the early '50s, when the strictures of the peace treaty had been much relaxed by the Allied authorities, the aircraft returned under full control of the Italian Air Force.

500|$|Smith's {{decision}} to write The Utility of Force {{was prompted by}} his experience in the Balkans. In late January 1995, Smith was appointed to command the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), sent {{to intervene in the}} Bosnian War. Smith was based in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, where he devised a strategy for the multi-national UN force that had been deployed effectively to carry out mainly <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tasks</b> but without a plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion. [...] At the time of Smith's deployment, Sarajevo {{was in the middle of}} a siege, which Smith was instrumental in lifting after arranging for NATO air strikes and an artillery barrage against Serb forces commanded by Ratko Mladic. A ground campaign by Bosnian and Croatian forces eventually led to the Dayton Agreement, which brought the war to an end. It was also during Smith's command of UNPROFOR that the Srebrenica massacre—recognised by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia as an act of genocide—took place. Historian Niall Ferguson was adamant that Smith bore no responsibility for the events at Srebrenica and was indeed one of the few British officials [...] "to emerge with distinction" [...] from the intervention in Bosnia; nonetheless, Ferguson believed that the experience illuminates Smith's theoretical writings.|$|R

40|$|While all {{the major}} NATO navies have been under {{considerable}} pressure to downsize {{following the end of}} the post-Cold War, the higher degree of political instability world-wide has led to a desire to increase the deployability of the reduced number of naval assets. Thus there has been an increased interest in providing a new generation of naval support vessels as part of each navy’s contribution to Coalition peacekeeping. These new support ships are often also required to provide a contribution to amphibious capabilities, including <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tasks,</b> in littoral operations. This means there is a challenging combination of capabilities being sought from the current replacements of traditional afloat support ships. This paper describes the design work undertaken by the Design Research Centre at UCL, as part of a bid team responding to a Canadian National Defence Department requirement for feasibility studies into a “Joint Support Ship” programme. The UCL task consisted of designing a range of possible design options, to investigate the impact of capabilities on the configuration of this innovative concept, exploring the requirement’s two levels of capability, namely, “shall ” and “should ” as part of designing to cost and capability. A range of concepts was designed using the UCL Design Building Block approach, using the SURFCON module of the Graphics Research Corporation PARAMARINE ship design system. The advantage this approach gave in designing these novel solutions is shown through the ability of the DBB concept approach to balance both technical and configurational features, thereby enabling significantly different ship styles to be readily produced and compared...|$|R
