500|$|Kills {{discussed}} Perfectionist during 2013 interviews. She {{revealed that}} after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. [...] "I {{was not as}} aware of... how I was", she stated. [...] "I almost {{had a bit of}} fear where <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be loved, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of myself into the album and then [...] bits out." [...] That year, Corner hailed Perfectionist as [...] "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had [...] "killer" [...] choruses, the album suffered from excessive similarities to other artists.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{just feel}} like this record is really different- youve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' {{creativity}} to marinate. It {{took me a while}} but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|Bangalter and Homem-Christo have {{credited}} {{many sources}} that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English {{as a second}} language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: [...] "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be in a band." [...] They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that [...] "put everything together" [...] in terms of genre".|$|E

500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Mark Hoppus penned [...] "Adam's Song" [...] to vent these {{frustrations and}} the {{loneliness}} he experienced on the tour; {{while the other}} members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single. [...] "When you're on tour, you're so lonely," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "You hang out with all your bros and it's a great time and everything, but <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> come home and have a girlfriend. And every time we'd fly home, Tom and [...] Scott [...] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn't.

500|$|On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL {{championship}} {{football games}} which were followed {{the day after}} with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL, Steelers ownership {{made the decision to}} re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid overtop the [...] Desso GrassMaster surface. The field's condition was exacerbated by 1½inches of rain after the new sod had been laid, which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began. The field conditions during the game ended up being so bad that at one point during the game, a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon Fields ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing. The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17seconds remaining in regulation; it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943. Scott Brown, of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a [...] "veritable mud pit". While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league. Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions [...] "horrendous" [...] after the game. However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> keep the grass." [...] Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following Thanksgiving on the road at the team's request.|$|E

500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise.

2500|$|Literary {{figures from}} {{different}} eras have also weighed in (sometimes humorously) on the matter. Alan Bennett, the modern English playwright and author, said that [...] "Definition of a classic: a book everyone {{is assumed to}} have read and often thinks they have read themselves." [...] Mark Van Doren, the Columbia University professor and poet, is quoted by Jim Trelease (in his library-monograph Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience), as saying that [...] "A classic is any book that stays in print". And in his [...] "Disappearance of Literature" [...] speech given over a century ago in 1900, Mark Twain said, (referring to a learned academic's lofty opinion of Milton's [...] "Paradise Lost") that the work met the Professor's definition of a classic as [...] "something that <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> have read and nobody wants to read".|$|E
2500|$|Fifty {{to sixty}} actresses auditioned {{for the role}} of Anna. Baccarin was {{initially}} rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role. He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and [...] "commanding presence" [...] to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of what people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see, {{and at the same time}} you have your own agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: [...] "My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love." ...|$|E
5000|$|There was {{too much}} gore in the first season, and it was for shock's sake. There was no humor. <b>Everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{know more about the}} Millennium Group.

500|$|This was {{the series}} <b>everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see {{because of what}} {{happened}} in the 2003 ALCS.

2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what {{they want us to}} be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|To GM's product {{planners}} and marketers, {{the fact that}} the Corvette had become known as an [...] "old man's toy" [...] became a prime factor in developing the next generation. Studies showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers in 2012, through October, were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of Audi R8 and 30 percent of Porsche 911 customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledges that too many people saw it as the car of [...] "the successful plumber." [...] John Fitzpatrick, Corvette's marketing manager said [...] "It's the old saying, 'Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man's car, but <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be seen driving a young man's car.' [...] " [...] To counter that perception GM planned to make the new generation C7 more aspirational to younger people. Towards that end, a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game Gran Turismo 5 in November 2012. [...] As part of the marketing effort associated with the introduction of the new generation, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 utilized a Corvette for the 12th time as its pace car.|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 2014, Rolling Stone {{reported}} that the Celebrity Skin line-up of the band had reunited (with Patty Schemel in lieu of Samantha Maloney). Rolling Stone erroneously reported Love's upcoming solo single, [...] "Wedding Day" [...] to be a product of this reunion. Shortly after, Love curtailed her statement, saying: [...] "We may have made out {{but there is no}} talk of marriage. It's very frail, nothing might happen, and now the band are all flipping out on me." [...] On May 1, in an interview with Pitchfork, Love discussed the possibility of a reunion, and also stated it had been [...] "a mistake" [...] releasing Nobody's Daughter as a Hole record in 2010. [...] "Eric was right—I kind of cheapened the name, even though I'm legally allowed to use it. I should save [...] "Hole" [...] for the lineup <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see and had the balls to put Nobody's Daughter under my own name." [...] Love further discussed the possibility of reuniting the band, saying: No one's been dormant. Patty teaches drumming and drums in three indie bands. Melissa has her metal-nerd thing going on—her dream is to play Castle Donington with Dokken. Eric hasn't flipped—I jammed with him, he's still doing his Thurston -crazy tunings, still corresponding with Kevin Shields. We all get along great. There are bands who reunite and hate each others' guts.|$|E
