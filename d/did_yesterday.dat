500|$|Much {{to their}} discontent, {{the media were}} not allowed to ask questions. Patrick Smith of The Age said, [...] "To deliver such bland {{explanations}} to the world media as they <b>did</b> <b>yesterday</b> and then not accept questions was contemptuous of the Australian public they have let down so badly." [...] The press attention was so intense that when Waugh attempted to relax with a round of golf at a local course, media helicopters flew overhead.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph called Agnew and Murphy's effort, [...] "new {{heights of}} ingenuity". Agnew's {{reaction}} to the event was, [...] "It's {{a sad day for}} everyone involved in English cricket. Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game {{for the good of the}} game is going to have to be charged for it?" [...] However, he remained upbeat about the situation: [...] "Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I <b>did</b> <b>yesterday</b> in my commentary box. There's a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled tuk-tuks – it's rather fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – State Department {{spokeswoman}} Marie Harf at daily press briefing: [...] "Today’s {{presidential election}} in Syria is a disgrace. Bashar al-Assad has no more credibility today than he <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> In a country where {{there is not a}} free society, this selection process is a inconceivable situation," [...] she said.|$|E
50|$|We {{asked that}} it be <b>done</b> <b>yesterday.</b>|$|R

5000|$|What <b>did</b> I <b>do</b> <b>yesterday</b> {{that helped}} the {{development}} team meet the sprint goal? ...|$|R
2500|$|Banville {{is highly}} scathing {{of all of}} his work, stating of his books: [...] "I hate them all ... I loathe them. They're all a {{standing}} embarrassment." [...] Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, [...] "You have to crank yourself {{up every morning and}} think about all the awful stuff you <b>did</b> <b>yesterday,</b> and how you can compensate for that by doing better today." [...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't let him {{wander off}} {{again as he}} <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> We depend upon you, you know, to keep a close watch upon him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Stretching out her hands.] You are a nice boy. It was charming {{of you to}} say--what you <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> I {{could have}} hugged you there and then.|$|E
25|$|What <b>did</b> you <b>do</b> <b>yesterday?</b> - *Worked on. (unacceptable, so {{worked on}} {{is not a}} constituent).|$|R
50|$|This {{is a man}} {{who knows}} how to SPOW. He is SPOWING. He did the same thing <b>yesterday.</b> What <b>did</b> he <b>do</b> <b>yesterday?</b> Yesterday he________.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{scarcely}} conceive," [...] replied the Abbess, [...] "the cogent reasons, which, existing as {{they must have}} <b>done</b> <b>yesterday,</b> have nevertheless delayed their operation until to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never felt}} so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled with a blessed peace, as I <b>did</b> <b>yesterday</b> when I learned that Michael Angelo was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've done {{twice as}} much as we <b>did</b> <b>yesterday</b> at this time, an' I'm countin' on gettin' twelve or fifteen dollars as my share of this day's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Sam, you're {{the doctor}} and what you say goes. I {{certainly}} don't want to act like I <b>did</b> <b>yesterday</b> again," [...] and poor Tom looked greatly worried.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby turned {{upon him}} almost savagely. “Stop,” he said. “You know {{the thing is}} decided as well as I <b>do.</b> <b>Yesterday</b> took {{a good deal of}} the {{stiffening}} out of me—and in another hour or two we shall have a tolerably difficult part to play.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I've had nothing, and I {{only know}} what I see. I see that thing and I guess. Well," [...] he added, [...] "it comes as pat as in a play, for I've {{precisely}} turned up this morning--as I would have <b>done</b> <b>yesterday,</b> {{but it was}} impossible--to take you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he looks}} {{as hard as}} iron and sound as a roach, but {{appearances}} are deceptive. I should have said as you <b>do</b> <b>yesterday</b> if anyone had asked me. I have come to tell you to-day in confidence {{that he has not}} many months, perhaps not many weeks to live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it'll perhaps rain {{cats and}} dogs to-morrow, as it <b>did</b> <b>yesterday,</b> and then you can't go," [...] said Godfrey, hardly knowing whether he wished for that {{obstacle}} or not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will! you have. You <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> You do always. You have no decency; {{you make}} {{no secret of}} your temper; you have exposed {{yourself}} to Mr Chuzzlewit a hundred times.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{nearly as}} much as it <b>did</b> <b>yesterday,</b> sir. It's my opinion that I'll be all right in a day or two. Seems to me {{outrageous}} to make so much ado about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, my dear; he {{will tell}} you that himself." [...] But Mrs. Crawley, though she {{answered}} him with a voice intended to be cheerful, greatly feared the coming of this messenger from the palace. She perceived at once that the bishop was about to interfere with her husband in consequence of that which the magistrates had <b>done</b> <b>yesterday.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, sir, I'll go {{and look}} after the camels and those half-bred Jew boys what you call Abati, but I call rotten sneaks, for if they get their thieving fingers into those {{canisters}} of picric salts, thinking they're jam, as I found them trying to <b>do</b> <b>yesterday,</b> something may happen in Egypt that'll make the Pharaohs turn in their graves and the Ten Plagues look silly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Our lets {{here are}} excellent, {{and we shall}} have a great house to-night. We had a very fine and {{enthusiastic}} audience in the Free Trade Hall, at Manchester, on Saturday; but our first nights there never count up in money, as the rest <b>do.</b> <b>Yesterday,</b> [...] "Charlotte," [...] Sainton, and Piatti stayed with us here; and {{they went on to}} Hull this morning. It was pleasant to be alone again, though they were all very agreeable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and you insulted his memory. You <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> You {{know you}} did. And I will never forgive you. Never!" [...] said Amelia. She shot out each little {{sentence}} in a tremor {{of anger and}} emotion.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{is it that}} I {{find the}} 'Dolphin' bearing {{different}} hues to-day from what she <b>did</b> <b>yesterday?</b> {{and why is it}} that neither then, nor now, does she resemble in her paint, the slaver of Newport harbour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{shall never}} again do {{anything}} as foolish as I <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> I have learned my lesson. And Oh! Lew, I am {{so grateful to}} you for saving me. When will you return to the Fort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay; the {{man went}} away two days ago, and we sent off the two 'prentices yesterday. There is naught <b>doing.</b> <b>Yesterday</b> half the {{vessels in the}} Pool cleared out on {{the news of the}} Plague having got into the City, and I reckon that, before long, there won't be a ship in the port. We shall have a quiet time of it, you and I; we shall be like men in charge of an old hulk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>did</b> preach <b>yesterday,</b> {{and shall}} till {{he has got}} another assistant. But he and I are parted as regards all {{friendly}} connection." ...|$|R
50|$|Sam <b>did</b> the {{cleaning}} <b>yesterday.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Start {{by telling}} me what you <b>did</b> <b>yesterday,</b> before I met you and your friend {{on the road to}} this place," [...] replied Mr. Hawbury. [...] "We will say, you got up and had your breakfast. What next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Summerlee craned {{his neck}} to look round the horizon. [...] "It seems clear and fine," [...] said he in a very dubious voice; [...] "but so it <b>did</b> <b>yesterday.</b> I am by no means assured that it is all over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will rest {{here until}} two o'clock," [...] said Mr. Rover. [...] "It is {{all out of}} the {{question}} to travel {{in the heat of the}} day, as we <b>did</b> <b>yesterday,</b> in such a climate as this. Even the natives cannot stand that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You <b>did</b> well <b>yesterday,</b> my dear,' said Fagin. 'Beautiful! Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on {{the very}} first day! The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{have done}} so, my friend, {{would have been}} to show myself an enemy to you. While I was striving to make my way inside the British lines, pretending that I was simply bent on curiosity, he came up, {{seemingly}} having a right of way everywhere within the encampment, and when he greeted me civilly, evidently wondering why I was there alone, I could do no less than treat him as I would have <b>done</b> <b>yesterday,</b> in the hope that something might drop from his lips which would aid me in my search." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} you <b>did.</b> And, <b>yesterday</b> morning, if Gracie had not pleaded to stay out a little longer, you would have cut your work short because of my presence." ...|$|R
