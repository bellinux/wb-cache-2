5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
25|$|And {{they told}} us, the Inquisitor {{would have us}} separated, because I was weak, and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> into a cooler room; but Sarah should abide there. I {{took her by the}} arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> {{to the ice}} cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I {{have no interest in}} ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

500|$|Jennings pleased {{some conservatives}} though, after his three-year {{lobbying}} {{effort to create}} a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a [...] "town meeting" [...] segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. [...] "People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back to Canada," [...] he said. [...] "I hope I don't make that mistake again." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E
500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E

At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted {{me and told me}} that I had potential and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to Lahore".|$|E

2500|$|Resigning {{from the}} National Hospital in 1892, Rivers {{travelled}} to Jena {{to expand his}} knowledge of experimental psychology. Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures, not only on psychology but on philosophy as well. He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, the picture galleries, the church services, and the education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement. In this diary he also wrote that: [...] "I have {{during the last three}} weeks {{come to the conclusion that}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> in for insanity when I return to England and work as much as possible at psychology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the Sifre {{defined the}} terms [...] "augurer," [...] "diviner," [...] "soothsayer," [...] and [...] "sorcerer" [...] within {{the meaning of}} [...] An [...] "augurer" [...] was one who took hold of a staff and said, [...] "Whether <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> or not." [...] Rabbi Ishmael said that a [...] "soothsayer" [...] was someone who passed {{something}} over his eye. Rabbi Akiva said that soothsayers calculated the seasons, as did those who declared that the years prior to the seventh year produced good wheat or bad beans. The Sages said soothsayers were those who performed illusions. The Sifre defined [...] "diviners" [...] as people who said that something could be divined from, for example, bread falling from someone's mouth, a staff falling from someone's hand, a snake passing on one's right or a fox on one's left, a deer stopping on the way before someone, or the coming of the new moon. The Sifre taught that a [...] "sorcerer" [...] was someone who actually carried out a deed, not merely performing an illusion.|$|E

2500|$|On July 14, 1958, the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq {{was overthrown}} by a {{military}} coup d'état. Fearing {{that he would be}} next, Lebanese president Camille Chamoun appealed for American military aid within 48 hours to settle domestic unrest in his own country, invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine, which stated that the United States would intervene upon request to stabilize countries threatened by international communism. Holloway, who happened to be serving on a Selection Board in Washington at the time, promptly met with Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke, who warned that a deployment order was imminent but that commitments in East Asia precluded any reinforcements from the Seventh Fleet. Retorted Holloway, [...] "I don't need any help. I can take over all of the Lebanon if you say the word." [...] As one of Burke's few remaining peers in the Navy, Holloway took the opportunity to tease the CNO. [...] "But I've already had another proposition....From some Britisher. He thinks, if there's action, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> up and take the port of Tripoli to protect their oil installations there." [...] The famously mercurial Burke cursed him out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!" [...] She described Bianca as a [...] "king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" [...] and a [...] "prize slapper [...] tormented all those whose paths [...] crossed." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me about it all the time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E

2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
