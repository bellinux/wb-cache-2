5|$|January 20, 2004 - A {{possible}} {{tropical storm}} or <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic Ocean hits eastern Brazil, dropping heavy rainfall in the area.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1931, at {{the height}} of the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the Territorial Army was called to guard the Town Hall during a protest against {{unemployment}} and hunger.|$|E
5|$|The site of Myles Standish's house reveals only {{a slight}} <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground where the cellar hole was, but {{it is now a}} small park owned and {{maintained}} by the town of Duxbury.|$|E
50|$|Ponds or {{depressions}} sometimes {{water is}} lifted from ponds and <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way.|$|R
5000|$|The {{early bird}} baths were simple <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground. The first purpose built bird bath was {{developed}} by UK garden design company Pulman & Sons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s.|$|R
60|$|Helen's {{scrutiny}} {{was rewarded}} by descrying several tiny <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pine-needles, dark <b>in</b> color and sharply defined.|$|R
5|$|The woollen mills of the Teifi valley were hard-hit by {{the drop}} in {{purchasing}} power of miners during the <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coal trade of the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E

50|$|In America in 1943, O.A. Buettner {{patented}} {{a composite}} design <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> secondary fighter components' wings fitted into <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carrier's upper wing.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Canning River as {{a source}} of water for Perth was first {{proposed}} in a report of the first Metropolitan Water Works Board of Perth in 1896. Investigation of the site began in 1897 when engineer Thomas Hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam's current location as a possible site. However, despite the recommendations of further inquiries, and an extreme shortage of water in some years, government funds were not allocated {{for the construction of a}} dam until the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Economic <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and {{war in the}} 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg {{to decline}} {{severely}} and then lose its factory completely. The family rebuilt the factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students.|$|E
50|$|Mweru is shallow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{south and}} deeper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, with two <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{north-eastern}} section with maximum depths of 20 m and 27 m.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> many <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Hesse Highlands and Lowlands {{have led}} to a buildup of loess soils, which is why arable farming is {{widespread}} here.|$|R
5|$|In France, {{marketing}} authorization {{was granted}} for Zyban on 3 August 2001, {{with a maximum}} daily dose of 300mg; only sustained-release bupropion is available, and only as a smoking cessation aid. Bupropion was granted a licence for use in adults with major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands in early 2007, with GlaxoSmithKline expecting subsequent approval in other European countries.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Stanford University {{professor}} Robert E. Swain proposed {{creating a}} research institute in the Western United States. Herbert Hoover, then {{a trustee of}} Stanford University, was also an early proponent of an institute, but became less involved with the project after he {{was elected president of}} the United States. The development of the institute was delayed by the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and World War II in the 1940s, with three separate attempts leading to its formation in 1946.|$|E
5|$|No {{recession}} of the post-World War II era has come {{anywhere near the}} depth of the Great <b>Depression.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of the second quarter of 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).|$|E
50|$|Yeşilyurt plain is {{situated}} <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> pot-shaped small plains surrounded by mountains as formed by <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Neogene (the other similar formations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate neighborhood are the Muğla, Gülağzı, Yerkesik, Akkaya, Yenice, Çamköy and Ula plains).|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} in undulating terrain and <b>in</b> winter wet <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy soils.|$|R
50|$|A {{medium to}} large tree {{reaching}} to 30 metres tall and 90 cm <b>in</b> trunk diameter. <b>The</b> cylindrical trunk is reddish brown or grey, with raised dots and <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bark. The tree's base is somewhat buttressed or flanged.|$|R
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrain, {{remaining}} pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division {{engaged in}} regular drills but no major events {{in its first}} few years, though the division's Colorado {{elements}} were called in to help quell a large coal mining strike. The onset of the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s severely curtailed its funding for training and equipment. Major General Roy Hoffman took command in 1931, followed by Alexander M. Tuthill, Alexander E. McPherren in 1935, and William S. Key in 1936. In 1937, the division's troops were once again called up, this time to help manage a locust plague affecting Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, a <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull, {{is located}} on the upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E

5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share {{incubation}} duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible <b>depression.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} on flats and winter wet <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South West region of Western Australia between Capel and Augusta where it grows in gravelly-sandy soils over laterite.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae of this limpet species settle and {{metamorphose}} on the algal frond. Here {{it feeds}} on its host’s tissue using its radula, leaving small <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frond.|$|R
50|$|The related Venenosaurus had unusual lateral fossae, {{which looked}} like deep <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outside walls of the {{vertebral}} centra. Some fossae are divided into two chambers by a ridge inside <b>the</b> <b>depression.</b> <b>In</b> most sauropods <b>the</b> fossae would form pneumatic openings leading to {{the interior of the}} centrum, rather than just being a depression. Less well-developed, but similar fossae are known from Cedarosaurus itself.|$|R
