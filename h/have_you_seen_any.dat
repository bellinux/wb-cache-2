6000|$|... "See here, Bill. Be careful how you answer, for {{a mistake}} may cost you your place. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one pass down the lane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Sammy Jay, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> {{one pass}} this way?" [...] asked Happy Jack. [...] "Some one has stolen a store of nuts from the hollow {{in the old}} {{chestnut}} tree." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{put aside}} the whole subject with a look. [...] "You were not at Mr. Dryfoos's the other day. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> them, <b>any</b> of them, lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a rather}} {{difficult}} idea to grasp. I tried a change of subject. [...] "You're nearly the first Fairy I ever saw. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> people besides me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is; and, to say truth, I {{have come}} out to search for you chiefly to inquire whether <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> young woman at all {{resembling}} Branwen during your wanderings in this region?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} {{looks as}} if somebody had set this fire," [...] mused Senator Morr. [...] "Perhaps a tramp. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> such fellows around here?" [...] he asked, looking at the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "You sail so nigh the wind, friend Joram," [...] coolly {{interrupted}} the old man, [...] "as to keep every thing shaking. Just bethink you of a plain answer: <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> thing {{wrong about the}} slaver?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{the best}} I've ever had; but do you know, Paddy, I suspect {{that they may be}} one of the reasons I am hunted so," [...] replied Lightfoot a little sadly. [...] "Good looks are not always to be desired. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> hunters around here lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, {{you tell}} us, just the same,” said Dave. “I {{want to know}} if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> other men sneaking around town to-night. If <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> it may pay you to tell me about it.” ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of them, and I {{think it}} is very likely, for they can only be formed and {{perceived}} by the means of suitable instruments. And so here is a picture of some ice-blossoms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother," [...] said poor Maggie, {{shrinking}} {{from the}} {{thought of all the}} contact her bruised mind would have to bear, [...] "tell her I'm very grateful; I'll go to see her as soon as I can; but I can't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> one just yet, except Dr. Kenn. I've been to him,--he will advise me, and help me to get some occupation. I can't live with any one, or be dependent on them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread. But did you hear nothing of Philip--Philip Wakem? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one that has mentioned him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you may know," [...] he said, after {{introducing}} himself, [...] "a {{number of}} crimes were committed {{in and around}} Oakdale last night. We are searching for clews to the perpetrators, some of whom must {{still be in the}} neighborhood. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> strange or suspicious characters around lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't any bug, Mr. Toad, and I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] replied Jimmy, remembering his politeness. [...] "I just thought there was. You see, I didn't {{know you were}} under that piece of bark. I hope you will excuse me, Mr. Toad. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> fat beetles this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy chuckled. [...] "No, you don't!" [...] said he. [...] "If {{there is}} {{anything}} you want to know from Grandfather Frog, ask him yourself. I don't want to know how Lightfoot learned to jump. He may jump over the moon, for all I care. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> fat beetles this morning, Peter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that you are right," [...] agreed Mr. Mangan. [...] "It is a matter which is being a great deal {{discussed}} just now, however. Let us speak of your personal plans. What do you intend to do for the next few weeks, say? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> been to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> of your relatives yet?" ...|$|R
60|$|Chairman. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of the German {{copies of}} some of the great Italian masters, which are {{generally}} esteemed very admirable works?--I have not much studied the works of the copyists; I have not observed them much, never having yet found an exception to that rule which I have mentioned. When I came across a copyist in the Gallery of the Vatican, or in the Gallery at Florence, I had a horror of the mischief, and the scandal and the libel upon the master, from the supposition that such a thing as that in any way resembled his work, and the harm that it would do to the populace among whom it was shown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please listen," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{am afraid}} that your father must be in a tearing rage by now, but it can't be helped. He is out there and he hasn't got an earthly chance of getting back until I give the word. We've got {{plenty of time to}} reach Nice before he can land. I just want you to realise, Fedora, that you are your own mistress. You can make or spoil your own life. No one else has any right to interfere. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one yet, back in your own country, amongst your own people, whom you really felt that you cared for--who you really {{believed}} would be willing to lay down his life to make you happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} quite so hard-hearted as {{you try to}} seem, Mr. Aynesworth," [...] she said quietly. [...] "I {{want to ask you a}} question. You must answer it? You don't know how much it means to me. You are Sir Wingrave Seton's secretary; you have access to all his papers. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> letters of mine? Do you know if he still has any in his possession?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 33. 'And what is strange, {{the author}} of this theft Has stolen the fatted heifers every one, [...] 255 But the four dogs and the black bull are left:-- Stolen they were last night at set of sun, Of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft.-- Now tell me, man born ere the world begun, <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one pass with the cows?'-- [...] 260 To whom the man of {{overhanging}} brows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that {{would do}} while you kept it to yourselves; {{but now that}} your country is known to the plutocratic world, your public {{documents}} will be apt {{to come back to}} the countries your emissaries have visited, and make trouble. The first thing you know some of our bright reporters will get on to one of your emissaries, and interview him, and then we shall get what you think of us at first hands. By-the-by, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of those primitive social delights which Mrs. Makely regrets so much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Jimmy Skunk," [...] cried Chatterer the Red Squirrel. [...] "What are {{you doing}} over here in the Green Forest?" [...] Jimmy Skunk looked up and grinned. It was a slow, good-natured grin. [...] "Hello, everybody," [...] said he. [...] "I thought I would just amble over here and see your school. I suppose all you fellows are getting so wise that pretty soon you will think you know {{all there is to}} know. <b>Have</b> <b>any</b> of <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> fat Beetles around here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At this {{critical}} moment entered the Counsellor and Dinmont. The former beheld to his astonishment the Colonel but just recovering {{from his first}} surprise, Lucy Bertram ready to faint with terror, and Miss Mannering in an agony of doubt and apprehension, which she in vain endeavoured to disguise or suppress. 'What {{is the meaning of}} all this?' said he; 'has this young fellow brought the Gorgon's head in his hand? let me look at him. By Heaven!' he muttered to himself, 'the very image of old Ellangowan! Yes, the same manly form and handsome features, but with a world of more intelligence in the face. Yes! the witch has kept her word.' Then instantly passing to Lucy, 'Look at that man, Miss Bertram, my dear; <b>have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one like him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{will help}} you a good deal; the game has been mostly shot or scared away along the line, {{but there is some}} to be <b>had,</b> and, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>any</b> meat <b>you</b> don't want you can swap for flour and other things with some of the emigrants. As to your pushing on, you might do that sometimes, but not very often. There are Redskins all along the line, and a man {{travelling}} by himself would have much trouble in getting through. As a general thing folks go in parties of ten or twelve waggons, often more, and then they are too strong for the Redskins to attack. I do not think you could travel much faster than the ordinary, not even if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> good horses. The bullocks travel slow, but they go a good many hours a day, and camp at night where there is water.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain sat up {{straight}} in his chair. [...] "Now look here," [...] he said; but he addressed the Mistress of the House, not the story-teller. [...] "How does this daughter of ours come to know all these things about lovers, and the weather-signs which indicate proposals of marriage, and all that? Has she been going about in society, making investigations into the rudiments of matrimony, during my last cruise? And would you mind telling me if any young men have been giving her lessons in love-affairs? John Gayther, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> stray lovers prowling about your garden of late?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So Mr. Morgan and his {{employer}} conversed as the latter's toilet proceeded. There {{had been a}} drawing-room on the previous day, and the Major read among the presentations that of Lady Clavering by Lady Rockminster, and of Miss Amory by her mother Lady Clavering,--and in a further part of the paper their dresses were described, with a precision and in a jargon which will puzzle and amuse the antiquary of future generations. The sight of these names carried Pendennis back to the country. [...] "How long have the Claverings been in London?" [...] he asked; [...] "pray, Morgan, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of their people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How nicely {{we are all}} crammed in," [...] cried Lydia. [...] "I am glad I {{bought my}} bonnet, if it is only {{for the fun of}} having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite {{comfortable}} and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, {{what do you think we}} did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately," [...] Laverick remarked, [...] "we cannot stand up. Please {{understand}} that I will not discuss this {{matter with you}} in any way. I will not borrow money from Rendell or any friend. I have asked the bank and I have asked Pages, who will be our largest creditors. To help us would simply be a business proposition, so far as they are concerned. As <b>you</b> know, they <b>have</b> refused. If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> hope in that direction, why don't you try {{some of your own}} friends? For every one man I know in the House, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seemed to be bosom friends with at least twenty." ...|$|R
5000|$|Deng Guida {{then used}} {{a wad of}} ¥4000 cash to hit her face while yelling, [...] "Didn't you want money? I bet <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> money before. How much money you want, just say it, believe me or not, I shall smack you to death with money." [...] Deng Yujiao retorted, [...] "Yes, I have never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> money before, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the guts, today you smack me to death." [...] Deng Guida then replied, [...] "I am going to smack you to death with money. I'm {{going to get a}} truck load of money to squash you to death." ...|$|R
5000|$|I'm sorry. I'm {{extremely}} sorry. We {{were hoping}} for an undefeated season. That was my goal, something Florida's never done here. But I promise you one thing: {{a lot of good}} will come out of this. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> player in the entire country play as hard as I will play the rest of this season and you'll never see someone push {{the rest of the team}} as hard as I will push everybody the rest of this season, and you'll never see a team play harder than we will the rest of this season. God Bless. Tim Tebow ...|$|R
40|$|Louisa Lim’s life as National Public Radio’s Shanghai {{correspondent}} {{is characterized}} by extreme variety. Much like China itself, Lim takes on many roles: hard-hitting investigative reporter, insightful trend spotter, art connoisseur, mother and even restaurateur. It turns out, she’s an excellent email-writer as well. In a wide-ranging Web 2. 0 interview, in between covering the Beijing Olympics and the ever-growing melamine disaster, she described her experiences in her three years as the Beijing correspondent for the BBC and then two with National Public Radio. She talked about the challenges of breaking news but still providing depth of coverage, the West’s growing interest in China and the joys of deep fried bumble bees. Angilee Shah: There is a phrase in the West that has taken on mythical qualities: “Our man in China. ” But you and many others prove that these days it’s likely to actually be “our woman in China” instead. What have been your most memorable (good and bad) experiences as a woman reporting in China? In the last five years, while you’ve been based in China, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> changes with regards to women in the press? Louisa Lim: The most memorable experiences as a woman reporting in China {{would probably have to}} be a trip I made to Xinjiang in 2003 to cover the AIDS problem there with my then producer at the BBC, Poppy Sebag-Montefiore. At the time she was around 23 and looked even younger. We’d arranged part of the trip officially because we wanted to interview local government officials from the department of health. When we arrived at their office, their faces fell. We sat around, drinking tea and waiting. In the next room, we could hear the government officials conferring with each other worriedly, “What’s the BBC doing?”, they were asking. “Do you think these are real reporters? They look more like kids on work experience. ...|$|E
6000|$|Is it so? We {{trust that}} we are Christ's sheep. We trust that he knows us: but do we know him? What answer shall we make to that question, Do you know Christ? I do not mean, Do you know ABOUT Christ? You may know ABOUT a person without knowing the person himself when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him. I do not mean, Do you know doctrines about Christ? though that is good and {{necessary}}. Nor, Do you know what Christ has done for your soul? though that is good and necessary also. But, Do you know Christ himself? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> him. True: but <b>have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> one like him--even in part? Do you know his likeness when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it in <b>any</b> of your neighbours? That is a question worth thinking over. Again--Do you know what Christ is like? What his character is--what his {{way of dealing with}} your soul, and all souls, is? Are you accustomed to speak to him in your prayers as to one who can and will hear you; and do you know his voice when he speaks to you, and puts into your heart good desires, and longings after what is right and true, and fair and noble, and loving and patient, as he himself is? Do you know Christ? ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{have not}} {{encountered}} a single scientist working {{in any of}} the many fields, from archaeology to astrophysics, on which Velikovsky touches who finds any interest whatever in anything he has to say. That is why <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> account of Velikovsky in our pages[...] [...] [...] The controversy seems to be generated wholly by Velikovsky and his sympathizers. They cry [...] "foul" [...] because he is ignored and attempt to make an academic freedom case of it. The controversy is thus quite secondary. As I see it, the threat to academic freedom comes the other way around: by such tactics the Velikovsky party tries to compel interest by scientists in work in which they can find no interest.|$|R
6000|$|No! I {{will not}} say one word about apologies or excuses for not writing--I am a poor, rascally gauger, {{condemned}} to gallop at least 200 miles every week to inspect dirty ponds and yeasty barrels, and where can I find time to write to, or importance to interest anybody? The upbraidings of my conscience, nay, the upbraidings of my wife, have persecuted me on your account these {{two or three months}} past. I wish to God I was a great man, that my correspondence might throw light upon you, to let the world <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> really are: and then I would make your fortune, without putting my hand in my pocket for you, which, like all other great men, I suppose I would avoid as much as possible. What are you doing, and how are <b>you</b> doing? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> lately <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of my few friends? What has become of the borough reform, or how is the fate of my poor namesake Mademoiselle Burns decided? O man! but for thee and thy selfish appetites, and dishonest artifices, that beauteous form, and that once innocent and still ingenuous mind, might have shone conspicuous and lovely in the faithful wife, and the affectionate mother; and shall the unfortunate sacrifice to thy pleasures have no claim on thy humanity! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 8. Tell briefly {{the story}} of Shakespeare's life. What fact in his life most {{impressed}} you? How does Shakespeare sum up the work of all his predecessors? What are the four periods of his work, and the chief plays of each? Where did he find his plots? What are his romantic plays? his chronicle or historical plays? What {{is the difference between}} a tragedy and a comedy? Name some of Shakespeare's best tragedies, comedies, and historical plays. Which play of Shakespeare's seems to you to give the best picture of human life? Why is he called the myriad-minded Shakespeare? For what reasons is he considered the greatest of writers? Can you explain why Shakespeare's plays are still acted, while other plays of his age are rarely <b>seen?</b> If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of Shakespeare's plays on the stage, how do they compare in interest with a modern play? ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} cross in Presto not to send to-day to the Coffee-house to see {{whether there was a}} letter from MD before I sent away mine; but, faith, I did it on purpose, because I would scorn to answer two letters of yours successively. This way of journal is the worst in the world for writing of news, unless one does it the last day; and so I will observe henceforward, if there be any {{politics}} or stuff worth sending. My shin mends in spite of the scratching last night. I dined to-day at Ned Southwell's with the Bishop of Ossory(1) and a parcel of Irish gentlemen. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> yet <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of the Spectators? Just three weeks to-day since I had your last, N.11. I am afraid I have lost one by the packet that was taken; that will vex me, considering the pains MD take to write, especially poor pretty Stella, and her weak eyes. God bless them and the owner, and send them well, and little me together, I hope ere long. This illness of Mr. Harley puts everything backwards, and he is still down, and like to be so, by that extravasated blood which comes from his breast to the wound: it was by the second blow Guiscard gave him after the penknife was broken. I am shocked at that villainy whenever I think of it. Biddy Floyd is past danger, but will lose all her beauty: she had them mighty thick, especially about her nose.|$|R
