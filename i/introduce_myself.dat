500|$|In 1994, Anggun {{released}} Yang Hilang, a {{greatest hits}} album of her Indonesian hits. She later sold her record company to fund her move to Europe, {{and moved to}} London for about one year. In a 2006 interview with Trax magazine, Anggun admitted to experiencing [...] "culture shock" [...] and having some serious financial problems while trying to start her new life in Europe, saying [...] "I thought the money that I got by selling my record company was enough , but I began to lose money, little by little. I had to spend so much on taking cabs and eating! So I ended up taking buses everywhere and going to clubs to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> as a singer." [...] She also admitted that she [...] "had to convert from being a shy, introverted, 'real' Javanese woman to being an unabashed, fearless, 'fake' Javanese woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrator is}} first-person, omniscient: [...] "I would <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> {{if it were}} not useless. The name I had last night will not be the same as the name I have tonight." [...] This might be a {{conscious}} echo of the opening of Melville's Moby-Dick: [...] "Call me Ishmael," [...] or perhaps a contemporary bathos. The title of the novella alludes to an old joke, also alluding to Moby-Dick. One of Sam's friends tells a shaggy dog story of a man who goes to India to study yoga, echoing Pip's passing mention of a joke in Melville's novel: he unscrews his navel, thinking he {{is on the verge of}} a revelation, and his ass falls off. This instance seems to suggest Sam's reluctance or inability to take risks or do anything to break the monotony of his routine life. His navel gazing is what makes him the object of Mailer's scorn and drains his life of significance.|$|E
60|$|I have ventured, Miss Susan, to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> to your charming niece.|$|E
5000|$|Boris {{would usually}} greet a new {{acquaintance}} by saying, [...] "Allow me to <b>introducing</b> <b>myself.</b> I am Boris Badenov, world's greatest no-goodnik." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Macheson," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{taking the}} liberty of <b>introducing</b> <b>myself.</b> Peter Drayton my name is, never mind my profession. It wouldn't {{interest}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{met them}} by accident, {{and as soon}} as I learned who they were I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> and said I knew your uncle Dunston Porter." ...|$|R

6000|$|Campbell: [...] "And I am magnanimity embodied. Let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> Mrs. Curwen!" [...] He bows, and Mrs. Curwen deeply courtesies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, on Martha's Vineyard--for that's {{the place}} I come from. Perhaps I {{ought to have}} <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> a little more particularly--I come from Martha's Vineyard, and my name is Daggett." ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{were the}} companions to whom I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> shortly after; and, while they {{went off to}} the office, I amused myself in looking round the rooms in which I was to spend the {{approaching}} winter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's {{too long}} a story," [...] said Miss Annie, with a laugh. [...] "You know I hadn't seen Aunt Keswick, then. I couldn't go about <b>introducing</b> <b>myself</b> {{to other people}} before I had seen her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I knew I was not mistaken,' said a very engaging, affectionate voice. 'It {{is quite}} {{shocking}} {{to have to}} <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> to you--Lady Conway--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> Mr. Bird. I am Dick Rover, {{and these}} are my brothers. Sam and Tom. These are my friends, Fred Garrison and John Powell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let him {{go through}} with it. It's no affair of mine. After all, your father's affairs don't concern me. It would be impertinent of me to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> into them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs Tipps, I presume? I {{bring you}} a letter from Clatterby station. Another {{messenger}} should have brought it, but I undertook the duty partly {{for the purpose of}} <b>introducing</b> <b>myself</b> as your son's friend. I-- my name is Gurwood." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was, I think, {{surprised}} to see me. When I {{came into the room}} where he was, and <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> I am Miss Lovel, and the rector of Yoxham is my brother. It does not signify about the maid in the least. We can do very well with her. I suppose she has been with you a long time." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{could not}} be gainsaid; and to a man {{connected}} with the Carlist organization the shortest way was to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> as that “Monsieur George” of whom he had probably heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> first," [...] said Roger. He {{gave his}} name and also those of his chums. [...] "I am the nephew of the late Maurice Harrison, of this place." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{your cousin}} Paul," [...] he said smilingly, [...] "though I am afraid I am <b>introducing</b> <b>myself</b> almost as briefly as your father just now excused himself to me. He told me I would find you here, but {{he himself was}} hastening on a Samaritan mission." ...|$|R
6000|$|Returning to the street, I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to Uncle Billy Fraser and Osmund Button {{and other}} Sun Prairie neighbors {{and when it}} became known that [...] "Dick Garland's boy" [...] was in town, many friends {{gathered}} about to shake my hand and inquire concerning [...] "Belle" [...] and [...] "Dick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{think how}} it came into my head. The fact is, I lost my {{presence}} of mind. You know he was my tutor at Christchurch, when poor dear Herbert and I were such friends, and very kind he was to us both; and so, the moment I saw him, I walked across the House, <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> {{and asked him to}} dinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit me, Mr. Courage," [...] he said, [...] "to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself.</b> My name is Stanley, James Stanley, and I {{come from}} Liverpool. Waiter, two best Scotch whiskies, {{and a large}} Schweppe's soda." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} first day of ethnographic {{fieldwork}} conducted by an M. A. student. Starting in a non-Roma community, and trying to reach the Roma, I describe the difficulty of conducting fieldwork for the first time. I discuss the day I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to the community, the awkward and unnatural behavior of teachers toward my future informants, and the confusion and shyness of the Roma students felt in my presence. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to go very much," [...] Herrara said. [...] "I have not yet had the {{pleasure}} of <b>introducing</b> <b>myself</b> to my family and friends as a lieutenant-colonel. Of course, I wrote to my people when I received the commission from Lord Beresford; but it would be really fun to surprise some of my school-fellows and comrades, so if you think that it will not be inconvenient I should like very much to go." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{afternoon}} I {{run across}} {{an ad in}} Rolling Stone Magazine that said [...] "Drummer available - Will do anything." [...] I called {{the guy on the}} telephone, and even though he {{was in the middle of}} a party, he took my call. I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> and said we were starting a band and that the band was looking for a drummer, and was he willing to do anything to make it? He says that he was, right away.|$|R
6000|$|... "As we {{seem likely}} to see {{something}} of one another {{during the next few}} days, nolens volens," [...] he remarked, [...] "may I <b>introduce</b> <b>myself?</b> My name is Wrayson, Herbert Wrayson, and I come from London." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Home," [...] pursued Graham, undeterred by his mother's remonstrance, [...] "might I {{have the}} honour to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> {{since no one}} else seems willing to render you and me that service? Your slave, John Graham Bretton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sociability {{and ease}} are {{the fashion of}} the day. I have been here an hour, my dear coz, and have taken the liberty of <b>introducing</b> <b>myself</b> to Mrs. Wilson and Miss Moseley," [...] replied the earl gravely, {{although}} a smile of meaning lighted his handsome features as he uttered {{the latter part of}} the sentence, which was returned by Emily with a look of archness and pleasure that would have graced her happiest moments of juvenile joy.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{went up to}} Marvel around lunchtime {{and spotted}} Stan Lee coming out of Marvel’s building. I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> and told him I {{just got out of}} the service and asked if I could show him my portfolio. He {{said he was going to}} lunch but that I could go up to Marvel and say that Stan said I could show my work to John Romita, the art director. I was able to go in right away to see him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ah, but I haven’t <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> Pleased to meet you, my name’s Linda. I’m thirty-one, {{five foot}} eight, 150 pounds and I wear the best clothes that {{money can buy}} (thanks to my husband’s {{limitless}} generosity). I arouse desire in men and envy in other women. And yet, every morning, when I open my eyes to this ideal world that everyone dreams of having but few achieve, I know the day will be a disaster." [...] - Excerpt from Adultery ...|$|R
