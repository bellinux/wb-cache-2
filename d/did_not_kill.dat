5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, a {{war broke}} out between Pangala' and Baruppu', a {{neighbouring}} state led by Pasusu. Tiku took {{an active role in}} a successful campaign against the neighbouring state, and when Pasusu was defeated Tiku took his place as ruler of Baruppu'. The newly annexed kingdom was rich in rice fields and easily defensible, giving Tiku great power. Although the Torajans traditionally valued manpower and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> more people than necessary, Baruppu' oral history describes Tiku as killing men, women, and children with abandon.|$|E

5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|Max's {{daughter}} Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes {{angry at}} Max for never mentioning Bradley, leading to his confessing {{that he knows}} Bradley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> Archie. Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he promised he would always look out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie. Outside, Stacey privately tells Ryan that Janine is telling the truth.|$|E

5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E

Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{money that}} Callum won from the casino is missing, and Samantha finds it with Jenny {{and her husband}} Dean (Tom Pelphrey), after they stole it. Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>kill</b> him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E

Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status.
