Reviewing all {{of the factors that}} would influence the design and materials selection of an appropriate response to the issues, the perfect system for housing people, whether it is in response to affordability, durability, comfort, cultural sensitivity, appearance or being locally appropriate, is using some kind of straw bale construction system with an integrated frost protected shallow foundation and a SkyTherm North design. The focus and intention of this research is to investigate a combined system using the three integrated strategies to provide an affordable, durable and sustainable Net Zero housing design for a cold climate. Those strategies are, namely, 1) A SkyTherm North, 2) Highly insulated building envelope, Straw bale Construction, with super-windows, and a 3) Frost Protected Shallow Foundation. A computer added design of a prototype is used to simulate the design strategies with, but not limited to, HEED, Energy Scheming, and EQuest.

However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption.

In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests.

The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %.
