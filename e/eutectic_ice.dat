40|$|A crucial {{transition}} in {{the origin of}} life was the emergence of an informational polymer capable of self-replication and its compartmentalization within protocellular structures. We show that the physicochemical properties of ice, a simple medium widespread on a temperate early Earth, could have mediated this transition prior to the advent of membraneous protocells. Ice not only promotes the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme but also protects it from hydrolytic degradation, enabling the synthesis of exceptionally long replication products. Ice furthermore relieves the dependence of RNA replication on prebiotically implausible substrate concentrations, while providing quasicellular compartmentalization within the intricate microstructure of the eutectic phase. <b>Eutectic</b> <b>ice</b> phases had previously been shown to promote the de novo synthesis of nucleotide precursors, as well as the condensation of activated nucleotides into random RNA oligomers. Our results support a wider role for ice as a predisposed environment, promoting all the steps from prebiotic synthesis to the emergence of RNA self-replication and precellular Darwinian evolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{articles}} {{belonging to}} the special issue are open access, all published articles are freely available online. International audienceHydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) with low molar substitution has better solubility in 8 %NaOH-water solution than pure cellulose. The thermal behavior of ternary HEC/NaOH/water mixtures was investigated by DSC, {{and the results are}} compared with those of cellulose/NaOH/water solutions, aiming at providing better understanding about cellulose dissolution mechanism in NaOH-water. At low polymer concentrations and below 0 °C, HEC and cellulose solutions exhibit a similar thermal behavior with <b>ice,</b> <b>eutectic</b> and/or melting and recrystallization peaks, showing that the overall interactions between NaOH, water and cellulose or HEC are identical. However, when the concentration increases above 2 %, the eutectic peak of HEC solutions disappeared, leaving only the ice peak, which is different from previous results for cellulose where the disappearance of the eutectic peak was related to the maximum solubility of cellulose (around 8 wt%). This implies that the dissolution behavior of HEC in NaOH solution is changed due to possible changes of chain flexibility and/or increased attractions to water caused by the hydrophilic hydroxyethyl groups. The melting and recrystallization peaks visible only at low concentrations of HEC or cellulose in solution also support the conclusion that dissolution of cellulose and HEC at low concentrations bears features which are not yet understood...|$|R
40|$|Cool storage {{technology}} {{can be used to}} significantly reduce energy costs by allowing energy intensive, electrically driven cooling equipment to be predominantly operated during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower. In addition, some system configurations may result in lower first costs and/or lower operating costs. Cool storage systems of one type or another could potentially be cost-effectively applied in most buildings with a space cooling system. A survey of approximately 25 manufacturers providing cool storage systems or components identified several thousand current installations, but less than 1 % of these were at Federal facilities. With the Federal sector representing nearly 4 % of commercial building floor space and 5 % of commercial building energy use, Federal utilization would appear to be lagging. Although current applications are relatively few, the estimated potential annual savings from using cool storage in the Federal sector is $ 50 million. There are many different types of cool storage systems representing different combinations of storage media, charging mechanisms, and discharging mechanisms. The basic media options are water, <b>ice,</b> and <b>eutectic</b> salts. <b>Ice</b> systems can be further broken down into ice harvesting, ice-on-coil, ice slurry, and encapsulated ice options. Ice-on-coil systems may be internal melt or external melt and may be charged and discharged with refrigerant or a single-phase coolant (typically a water/glycol mixture). Independent of the technology choice, cool storage systems can be designed to provide full storage or partial storage, with load-leveling and demand-limiting options for partial storage. Finally, storage systems can be operated on a chiller-priority or storage priority basis whenever the cooling load is less than the design conditions. The first section describes the basic types of cool storage technologies and cooling system integration options. The next three sections define the savings potential in the Federal sector, present application advice, and describe the performance experience of specific Federal users. A step-by-step methodology illustrating how to evaluate cool storage options is presented next, followed by a case study of a GSA building using cool storage. Latter sections list manufacturers, selected Federal users, and reference materials. Finally, the appendixes give Federal life-cycle costing procedures and results for a case study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{two different}} yet related chemical systems, both compatible with putative early earth geological environments, {{which could have}} readily and rapidly led to structurally complex molecules under mild, anaerobic aqueous conditions. In the first system, we report {{an example of the}} selective reactivity of H-phosphinic acid towards carbonyls which leads to interesting molecular architectures, some having structural motifs reminiscent of those in phosphor-sugars. The second system is based on H-phosphonic acid and its potential to be converted to condensed P-oxyacids which may have had some functional value within prebiotic environments. Chapter 2 outlines the reaction between H-phosphinic acid and pyruvic acid, and the various products that are produced under different environments, such as in the presence of metal ions, organics and at different pH. Chapter 3 discusses the structure of trieth- 3 and compares the similarities with RNA. Molecular modelling using X-ray data of trieth- 3 is used to evaluate the stability of it's structure in aqueous solution. The reaction between H-phosphinic acid and other prebiotically relelvant ketones is also described. Chapter 4 outlines the formation of pyrophosphite and its use as a possible prebiotic, phosphonylating agent. Chapter 5 outlines the reactions between glycerol and fatty acids and pyrophosphite as phosphonylating agent for this system.

40|$|The (NH_ 3) x(H_ 20) _(1. x) {{phase diagram}} for 0 ≤ X ≤ 0. 50 has been reexamined at {{temperatures}} from 125 K to 400 K and at pressures to 6. 0 GPa using diamond-anvil cells. By electroplating the gasket materials with gold, complicated reactions between sample solutions and gasket materials, which affected earlier studies, have been avoided. Sample pressures were determined using the ruby-luminescence technique, and phase assignments were made using optical characterization. Phase assignments were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. At room temperature the stable phases observed were fluid, high pressure ices (VI and VII), and ammonia monohydrate, NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O. The Ice VI and Ice VII liquidi at 295 K were extrapolated to intersect at X = 0. 26 ± 0. 01 and 2. 1 GPa. At room temperature, the <b>eutectic</b> for <b>Ice</b> VII and NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O {{was observed at}} 3. 3 ± 0. 2 GPa, and extrapolation of the room temperature liquidus indicates that the cotectic composition is near X= 0. 45. Near X= 0. 33. the stable phases were high pressure ices (VI, VII, and VIII), NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O, and another phase tentatively identified as ammonia dihydrate, NH_ 3 · 2 H_ 2 O. At this composition, the Ice VI liquidus and the congruent melting curve of NH_ 3 · 2 H_ 2 O interesect at 1. 8 ± 0. 2 GPa and 252 ± 5 K, and the Ice VII liquidus is approximately linear with a slope of 0. 016 ± 0. 002 GPa K^(- 1. To within {{the uncertainty of the}} experiment, the Ice VI liquidus continues smoothly from the Ice VII liquidus. The quadruple point among NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O, NH_ 3 ·H 2 O, Ice VI, and fluid is located at 250 ± 5 K and 1. 9 ± 0. 3 GPa, with the accompanying double cotectic at a composition of X= 0. 36 ± O. Ql. The eutectic for NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O and Ice VII is approximately linear with a slope of 0. 033 ± 0. 003 GPa K^(- 1). We have applied these data to the interior of Titan {{in a manner similar to}} the analysis of Lunine and Stevenson (1987). The main implication of these results is that Titan is likely to have a thicker NH_ 3 ·H_ 2 O ocean than previously suspected, because the stability field of NH_ 3 · 2 H_ 2 O is smaller than previously supposed. Implications for methane and ammonia volcanism on Titan are briefly discussed. The experimentally observed reactivity between the liquid and iron (for example) may also have implications for planetary and satellite evolution...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} natural resources is fresh water. An unfortunate issue is however, the low availability and high demand of fresh water world-wide. From the total resources industry consumes about 20 % (1200 km 3 yearly) [UN, 2007]. Industrial aqueous waste streams are therefore widely occurring, and their reuse becomes obligatory. For the recovery of water from dilute solutions multistage flash evaporation has been used for a long time. Reverse osmosis {{has proven to be a}} better alternative energy-wise, but is only a good option up to a solute concentration of about 5 % above which the required pressure becomes too high. Conventional separation processes then become too expensive, and the residual often large waste streams are collected in ponds for further atmospheric drying or discharged in surface waters. For the treatment of more concentrated waste waters novel separation techniques therefore had to be developed where besides pure water, one or more pure inorganic or/and organic compounds were obtained, and where only a minor bleed stream remains for e. g. incineration or disposal. If indeed additionally one or more pure secondary raw materials can be produced for reuse or with a market value, such a separation process becomes economically feasible, and has a fair chance to be implemented. Eutectic Freeze Crystallization fits this requirement. In this crystallization process, that operates under <b>eutectic</b> conditions, pure <b>ice</b> and a second pure solid compound such as a salt or an acid, are simultaneously formed in case of a binary aqueous solution. For a more complex solution both pure ice and a mixture of compounds or in subsequent steps pure ice and one of the pure compounds are formed. Since ice floats to the top of the vessel and the other compound(s) present in the solution settle(s) to the bottom, the separation of the ice from the salts is facilitated. For the first prototypes of EFC crystallizers horizontal heat exchanger disks were used with holes to allow transportation of crystals through these holes during their segregation. EFC research continues to improve these designs and create new ones that minimize energy consumption by cutting energy losses to the environment, by increasing the heat fluxes by improved scraper designs, and recently by a radical change in heat exchanger geometry to improve the gravitational separation efficiency. This research focuses on physical phenomena that take place inside a common cooling crystallizer or inside a eutectic freeze crystallizer with a scraped heat exchanger surface with the aim to improve the scraper and the crystallizer design. One of the limiting factors for heat transfer in EFC processes is the formation of an insulating ice scale layer on the heat exchanger surface. In spite of the fact that scrapers are used to increase the heat transfer at the solution side, as well as to avoid the formation of an insulating ice scale layer, such scrapers are only effective in keeping the surface free from ice up to a certain temperature difference between the coolant and the solution. Earlier experiments have also demonstrated that for a horizontal heat exchanger surface that was evenly cooled underneath and evenly scraped at the top, scaling still preferentially starts at specific areas of the surface. Since ice scale formation at a certain spot on the heat exchanger surface is a consequence of the local temperature difference between the surface and the solution, this implies that the temperature at the surface differs locally. These variations in local temperatures are most likely induced by the flow field of the liquid insidethe crystallizer. In chapter 2 the temperature distribution across the horizontal heat exchanger surface at the bottom of the crystallizer was therefore measured by Liquid Crystal Thermometry and the local heat transfer distribution was calculated, while the fluid velocity inside the crystallizer was directly visualized by Stereoscopic PIV measurements. Liquid Crystal Thermometry revealed that the temperature on the heat exchanger surface was not uniformly distributed with temperature differences larger than 4 oC. Such differences are sufficient to explain the local variation in scaling tendency. Experimental results showed that in the middle of the scraped heat exchanger area the heat transfer is larger than around the shaft and close to the crystallizer wall. A strong secondary fluid flow in this crystallizer geometry was shown by stereoscopic PIV measurements. This flow pattern in the crystallizer is undoubtedly related to the differences in local heat flux, but the local heat fluxes could not directly be explained without a more detailed knowledge of the flow field close to the HE surface in the scraper region. For more detailed information on the flow pattern between the scrapers and thus more closely to the HE surface we had to rely on computational flow simulations, because this region was not accessible for PIV measurements. The turbulent flow in the total scraped HE crystallizer was therefore computationally resolved by Large Eddy Simulations using a Lattice Boltzmann scheme as reported in chapter 3. The simulations were validated by comparison with the PIV measurements performed previously. The LES results could explain the radial local heat transfer distribution along the HE surface. The local heat flux is higher in the middle region of the HE surface between the shaft and the outer wall because the fluid descends directly from the bulk, and its residence time near the HE surface is low. The lower local heat flux coefficient around the shaft is because the fluid is largely in solid body rotation. Close to the outside wall, a worse situation for heat flux is provoked by a static vortex that brings the fluid into a segregated area. These fluid flow results explain the local heat flux distribution measured by the TLC experiments. The shape of the scraper has a large impact on the turbulent fluid flow and related behavior of the scraped off ice particles in the direct vicinity of the HE surface. For a well-designed scraper the ice particles have to be transported up by the flow into the solution, and should not be redirected to the surface. In chapter 4 the liquid flow is visualized by dye injection and the particles are monitored directly for two types of commonly used scraper geometries. In conjunction with this experimental work direct numerical simulations of the two phase (solid-liquid) flow system were done. The particle-flow simulations used Lattice-Boltzmann discretization to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, and a Lagrangian approach to particle tracking. The simulation results were in qualitative agreement with the experimental visualizations of the same system, and provided good insight in the behaviour of the particles and the fluid flow induced by the two scraper geometries. Only drag and gravity forces acting on the particles were taken into account. Furthermore particles collided elastically with the HE surface and the walls defining the moving scraper. Our numerical approach without particle-particle collisions provided satisfactory results for the streamlined scraper because this shape did not accumulate the particles during its scraper action. For the vertically oriented scraper this simulation approach failed due to the build up of particles as could be observed from the visualisation experiments. It was therefore considered to be essential to include particle-particle collisions in order to predict accumulation of particles. When this was implemented the simulations were in agreement with the results of the visualization experiments. This type of simulations demonstrates that scrapers can be primarily designed based on numerical predictions. In chapter 5 a novel laboratory scale scraped cooled wall crystallizer with 130 liter capacity, two internal vertical cylindrical heat exchangers, and a total heat transfer area of 2. 94 m 2. m- 3 crystallizer volume was designed. This crystallizer was tested for the recovery of Na 2 CO 3. 10 H 2 O and ice from an industrial aqueous sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate solution. Compared with earlier designs this new design showed a high improvement in gravitational separation and ice scaling removal, and high heat transfer fluxes were achieved between the heat exchanger and the solution up to 10. 5 kW. m- 2. A cone installed in the top section effectively directed the ice crystals towards the outlet. The total solid content in the crystallizer was up to 36 wt% under steady state conditions, with average crystal sizes for ice of 100 - 200 mm and 50 - 120 mm for Na 2 CO 3. 10 H 2 O. Impurities present in the solution, most likely the molybdate ions changed the habit of the Na 2 CO 3. 10 H 2 O crystals from pseudo hexagonal for a pure system to lozenges. In Chapter 6 the performance was tested of a scaled up version of the new type of crystallizer with two heat exchanger modules stacked on top of each other. This crystallizer was directly connected to a continuous carbonate/bicarbonate containing blow-down stream in an industrial plant. The EFC process was effectively operated at a heat transfer of 5 kWm- 2 without any ice scaling. Sodium carbonate decahydrate and pure ice were continuously produced at - 3. 8 oC by operating within the metastable zone width of bicarbonate. The crystals showed good filterability with a molybdenum content below 1 ppm. At - 4. 0 °C bicarbonate started to co-crystallize. The bimodal size distribution of the mixture resulted in poor filtration and purity of the salt product. Because of the necessity of an accurate phase diagram for the process described in chapter 6, the eutectic solubility lines of the ternary system NaHCO 3 -Na 2 CO 3 -H 2 O were determined experimentally and calculated with the extended UNIQUAC model in chapter 7. The extended UNIQUAC model describes the experimental data quite well. A special crystallizer was built and a procedure developed to accurately measure the eutectic solubility lines where ice and salt coexist in equilibrium with the solution. Anhydrous NaHCO 3 and Na 2 CO 3. 10 H 2 O were the only two types of crystals present in equilibrium with ice crystals in the ternary system. The anhydrous NaHCO 3 crystals were needle shaped with lengths between 5 and 10 ?m, that were agglomerated into particles of about 100 ?m to 300 ?m, while the Na 2 CO 3. 10 H 2 O were hexagonally shaped with sizes between 100 and 500 ?m. Chapter 8 focuses at the interface between a scale layer that grows upon a cooling surface and the solution. Scale formation on heat exchangers is not only happening in EFC processes or for ice, but is frequently encountered in many cooling crystallization processes. Crystallization is mostly an exothermic process. According to irreversible thermodynamics, the heat released during crystallization at the interface is distributed to both the liquid and solid phases which are in contact with the interface also for isothermal conditions. The excess entropy production rate for heat and mass transport into, out of and across the interface was used to define the fluxes and forces of the system. The method describes the interface as a separate (two-dimensional) phase in local equilibrium. Coupled heat and mass flux equations from non-equilibrium thermodynamics were defined for crystal growth and the temperature jump at the interface of the growing crystal. For theoretical and experimental simplicity the growth of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O on a cold surface was taken as an example. For a growth rate of 2. 33 × 10 - 3 mol. m- 2. s- 1, around 20 - 30 % of the heat of crystallization is calculated to be transferred back into the liquid side. The interface resistivity to mass transfer is 1. 26 × 103 J. m 2. s. K- 1. mol- 2, while the interface resistivity to heat transfer is 2. 1 × 10 - 7 m 2. K- 1. W- 1.
