40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} into the time-dependent changes <b>of</b> pork <b>meat</b> quality and composition {{have been carried out}} using standard analytical techniques and Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Characteristic changes in soluble protein content, microbial load and biogenic amine content have been measured in the time period from slaughter up to 20 to 30 days post mortem on samples of porcine musculus longissimus dorsi. Characteristic behaviour indicative of a deterioration <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> quality and an increase in microorganism population on the meat surface has been observed.

40|$|If we consult current treatises {{that address}} {{tuberculosis}} infection by Mycobacterium bovis, {{we find that}} they neglect meat or accord it very little importance as a vector of transmission of tuberculosis to humans. However, several decades ago, the books of Veterinary Inspection concerning food dedicated numerous pages to tuberculosis in meat and the seizure of consumptive animals. The criteria <b>of</b> attitudes concerning <b>meat</b> from tuberculosis-infected animals have fluctuated over time, from rigorous extremes that, on one hand, required the seizure and <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the food products obtained from infected animals from a strictly hygienic measure, to other more practical considerations applying economic arguments, and which accepted the conditional use of these products due to the universal shortage of animal proteins.

[...] Camping on these beaches compacts the sand and contributes to dune erosion, and the wheel ruts caused by vehicles driving on the beaches can trap the hatchlings on their journey to the sea. Coastal development contributes to barriers that make it difficult or impossible for adult turtles to reach nesting and feeding sites. [...] These turtles also fall prey to incidental capture. They are caught by fisherman, particularly by trawling, gillnet fishing, ghost nets, and crab pots. [...] Lastly, pollution is a concern for these creatures.
