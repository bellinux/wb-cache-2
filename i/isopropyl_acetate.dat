40|$|Ethanol {{has been}} {{suggested}} to elevate HCV titer in patients and to increase HCV RNA in replicon cells, suggesting that HCV replication is increased in the presence and absence of the complete viral replication cycle, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we use Huh 7 human hepatoma cells that naturally express comparable levels of CYP 2 E 1 as human liver to demonstrate that ethanol, at subtoxic and physiologically relevant concentrations, enhances complete HCV replication. The viral RNA genome replication is affected for both genotypes 2 a and 1 b. Acetaldehyde, a major product of ethanol metabolism, likewise enhances HCV replication at physiological concentrations. The potentiation of HCV replication by ethanol is suppressed by inhibiting CYP 2 E 1 or aldehyde dehydrogenase and requires an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio. In addition, <b>acetate,</b> <b>isopropyl</b> alcohol, and concentrations of acetone that occur in diabetics enhance HCV replication with corresponding increases in the NADH/NAD+. Furthermore, inhibiting the host mevalonate pathway with lovastatin or fluvastatin and fatty acid synthesis with 5 -(tetradecyloxy) - 2 -furoic acid or cerulenin significantly attenuates the enhancement of HCV replication by ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, as well as acetate, whereas inhibiting β-oxidation with β-mercaptopropionic acid increases HCV replication. Ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetate increase the total intracellular cholesterol content, which is attenuated with lovastatin. In contrast, both endogenous and exogenous ROS suppress the replication of HCV genotype 2 a, as previously shown with genotype 1 b.

40|$|The need {{to improve}} air quality has {{contribute}} to move towards a hydrogen economy. The consolidated technologies for H 2 production are mainly based on use of fossil fuels as raw material. However, the use of biomass has recently received particular attention as it is considered CO 2 neutral energy source. In particular bio-ethanol obtained by biomass fermentation could be an useful fuel for H 2 production if an appropriate technology allowing its use without a previous distillation may be individualized. In such contest, molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) operating at 650 °C could represent a valid example for bio-ethanol use since FC is a co-generative system and heat produced at electrodes could be exploited to sustain an endothermic process like ethanol steam reforming to produce H 2. Recently different catalytic systems were proposed to perform steam reforming of ethanol [1 - 5].

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>isopropyl</b> hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|R

40|$|Batch {{reactive}} distillation (BRD), {{combines the}} flexibility of batch processing with the advantages of reactive distillation and can offer advantages over conventional batch processing for small to medium volume production. BRD is also important in process development for reactive distillation. ^ The essence of reactive distillation is the integration between reaction and distillation. There are two limiting cases for integration between reaction and distillation, (1) no integration and (2) full integration. In this thesis, we have shown that by analyzing these two limiting cases, and combining the information obtained from two limiting cases in a novel way, we can develop a partial integrated design with an appropriate amount of integration and an appropriate operation mode, which can provide advantages over both conventional design without integration and a fully integrated design. ^ We apply this approach in two realistic examples, i. e. (1) <b>isopropyl</b> <b>acetate</b> synthesis and (2) 1, 1 -dimethoxyethane production. For the <b>isopropyl</b> <b>acetate</b> synthesis, we compare the vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid features of the phase equilibrium to nbutyl acetate and amyl acetate systems, and show {{the similarities and differences}} among them. In particular, we show why the isopropyl system is more difficult than the others and how to use the known information in two limiting cases to develop a semi-batch reactive distillation (SBRD) with partial integration, which overcomes the reactive azeotrope brought by full integration and results in a more efficient process for the production of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>acetate</b> than has been previously known. In SBRD, the loss of isopropanol can be substantially decreased, the purity of water can be improved, and the total refluxing or recycling of organic distillate can be avoided. The resulting SBRD can provide 20 % higher production efficiency than BRD. ^ For the example of 1, 1 -dimethoxyethane (DMA) synthesis, following the approach, we develop a partially integrated BRD, which can take advantage of integration to overcome the reaction equilibrium limitation, meanwhile avoid a distillation boundary brought by over-integration. This leads to a high-purity product, which is unattainable in a fully integrated reactive distillation process without special and expensive treatment of the methanol/DMA azeotrope. ^ In this thesis, we also address selectivity issues in BRD, and provide new results describing the impact of key operating parameters: the reflux or reboil ratio and the Damköhler number (Da). ^ We show that selectivity improvements in BRD are limited for high values of Da or for high values of the reflux or reboil ratio and that selectivity is enhanced as Da or reflux or reboil ratio is decreased. However, decreasing Da will cause conversion loss, which can be mitigated by increasing reflux ratio (or reboil ratio) at expense of selectivity. Consequently, there is an optimum value of reflux or reboil ratio that gives a maximum yield for systems operated at low or moderate Da. ^ We show sample results for a system of serial isomerization reactions and for the synthesis of ethylene glycol. For the isomerization, we show that for BRD with a constant heating rate, the additional heat released by reaction can improve selectivity at expense of conversion. For ethylene glycol synthesis, we show that at a low reboil ratio, integration between reaction and distillation has a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity by causing separation of the reactants. We also show that decreasing the reboil ratio {{near the end of the}} BRD can increase the removal rate of ethylene glycol and thereby improve selectivity. This operating strategy is different from the common practice in distillation of increasing the reboil ratio near the end of a batch or cut. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) :This study {{dealt with}} the wet {{agglomeration}} process in which a small quantity of binder liquid was added into a suspension of crystals, directly in the stirring vessel where the crystallization took place. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} evaluation of the effect of temperature on the agglomeration process in order to gain insight into the mechanism of the formation of the agglomerates. Materials and Methods: Carbamazepine was used as a model drug and water/ethanol and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were used as crystallization system and binder liquid, respectively. The agglomeration of crystals was carried out at various temperatures and the agglomerates were characterized in terms of size, morphology, density and mechanical strength. Results: Evaluation of the agglomerates along the course of agglomeration shows that the properties of the particles change gradually but substantially. Higher temperature of the system during agglomeration process favors the formation of more regular agglomerates with mechanically stronger and denser structure; this {{can be explained by the}} promotion effect of temperature on the agglomeration process. Conclusion: With optimized wet agglomeration temperature, spherical, dense, and strong agglomerates can be obtained...|$|E
