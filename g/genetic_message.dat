5000|$|Chapter six is {{entitled}} [...] "Invariance and Perturbations”. The similarity throughout all organisms of chemical machinery in both {{structure and function}} is set out. In regards to structure, all living beings {{are made up of}} proteins and nucleic acids and these are the same residues (twenty amino acids and four nucleotides). Similar functions are carried out by the same sequence of reactions that appear in all organisms for essential chemical operations (some variations exist that consist of new utilizations of universal metabolic sequences). On page 104 Monod states [...] "The fundamental biological invariant is DNA. That is why Mendel's definition of the gene as the unvarying bearer of hereditary traits, its chemical identification by Avery (confirmed by Hershey), and the elucidation by Watson and Crick of the structural basis of its replicative invariance, without any doubt constitute the most important discoveries ever made in biology." [...] He adds that the full significance of the theory of natural selection was established by these discoveries. There is a brief review of DNA whose structure is a helix with translational and rotational symmetry and if artificially separated the complementary strands will spontaneously reform. A very brief review of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase is given. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA defines the sequence of amino acids which in turn defines the folding of proteins which in turn defines an organism; [...] "One must regard the total organism as the ultimate epigenetic expression of the <b>genetic</b> <b>message</b> itself" [...] (Monod, 109). The author makes the point that translation is irreversible and never takes place from protein to DNA. In {{the last part of the}} chapter the author brings up the important subject of mutations. Various mutations such as substitutions, deletions, and inversions are listed. The accidental random chance of these mutations and that these unpredictable mutations alone that are the source of evolution is pointed out and exemplified. The [...] "error" [...] in the <b>genetic</b> <b>message</b> will be replicated with a high degree of fidelity. In the words of Monod [...] "the same source of fortuitous perturbations, of ‘noise’...is the progenitor of evolution in the biosphere and accounts for its unrestricted liberty of creation, thanks to the replicative structure of DNA: that registry of chance, that tone-deaf conservatory where the noise is preserved along with the music" [...] (Monod, 117).|$|E

Evidence reported establishes that such preadenylylated <b>genetic</b> <b>messages</b> are predominantly located in the ovum's subribosomal fraction and that fertilization elicits a rapid reallocation of these latent transcripts into the zygote's ribosomal fraction. Examination of the size distribution of the adenylylated RNA further demonstrates that the unfertilized egg contains a substantial population of RNA transcripts of exceptionally high molecular weight that are used as primers for the 2 -fold net synthesis of poly(A) that follows fertilization.

30|$|Exonization is {{an event}} which an intronic {{transposed}} element (TE) provides splice sites and leads to alternatively spliced cassette exons.

40|$|Hybridomas from spleen cell fusions of six BALB/c mice immunized with {{hypothalamus}} {{were analyzed}} by immunocytochemistry for antibodies reactive with paraffin sections of fixed rat brain. In a total of 135 antibody producers, 60 % were brain specific. Among these, 54 % reacted with glial elements, pituitary cells, or basal lamina of intracerebral capillaries, with little variation among individual hybridomas {{in each of these}} groups. Forty-six percent of brain-specific antibodies reacted with neuronal structures, localizing on nerve fibers, neurofibrils, or perikarya. Neuron-specific hybridomas could be classified into groups that localized in anatomically defineable overall patterns. Within these patterns individual hybridomas exhibited extensive qualitative localization diversity ("neurotypy"). Conceivably, the <b>genetic</b> <b>message</b> for a common "proantigen" within an overall pattern may be slightly modified during differentiation of a neuron, thus leading to minor variability in antigenic expression. During antibody formation, similar minor changes occur in the differentiation of the <b>genetic</b> <b>message</b> for the antibody variable region. Apparently, minor changes in the antibody combining site among groups of hybridomas is reflected in the detectability of minor neurotypic changes among differentiated neuronal proantigens.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a biologically {{relevant}} extension to the well-studied polymer model, formalising a network of molecules {{in which there are}} two “independent” types of polymer, which are able to catalyse each others’ (and their own) reactions, but cannot combine to form hybrid polymers. The motivation for this {{is the nature of the}} interaction between peptides and nucleic acids in the metabolic networks of modern cells. The importance of an extension addressing this mutually catalytic arrangement was highlighted in Kauffman’s 1986 paper, in note (vii) (p. 14): “An independent then symbiotic coexistence of autocatalytic protein sets and template replicative polynucleotides would obviously be useful in prebiotic evolution.” (While the present work does not address the templating ability of nucleic acids, this aspect has been studied previously [14, 20]). Moreover, this extension is highly relevant in the light of recent experimental results from Li et al. [5]. In their paper, the authors propose that interactions between polypeptides and polynucleotides occurred very early in chemical evolution, providing an alternative to the hypothesis that life began in an RNA World [21]. The authors state “The striking reciprocity of proteins and RNA in biology is consistent with our proposal: proteins exclusively catalyze nucleic acid synthesis; RNA catalyzes protein synthesis; and <b>genetic</b> <b>messages</b> are interpreted by the small ribosomal subunit, a ribonucleoprotein.” The reciprocity described here provides a clear motivation for theoretical investigation into the properties of these “symbiotic” polymer systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evolution has {{selected}} for organisms that benefit from genetically encoded cell-cell communication. Engineers {{have begun to}} repurpose elements of natural communication systems to realize programmed pattern formation and coordinate other population-level behaviors. However, existing engineered systems rely on system-specific small molecules to send molecular messages among cells. Thus, the information transmission capacity of current engineered biological communication systems is physically limited by specific biomolecules {{that are capable of}} sending only a single message, typically “regulate transcription. ” Results We have engineered a cell-cell communication platform using bacteriophage M 13 gene products to autonomously package and deliver heterologous DNA messages of varying lengths and encoded functions. We demonstrate the decoupling of messages from a common communication channel via the autonomous transmission of various arbitrary <b>genetic</b> <b>messages.</b> Further, we increase the range of engineered DNA messaging across semisolid media by linking message transmission or receipt to active cellular chemotaxis. Conclusions We demonstrate decoupling of a communication channel from message transmission within engineered biological systems via the autonomous targeted transduction of user-specified heterologous DNA messages. We also demonstrate that bacteriophage M 13 particle production and message transduction occurs among chemotactic bacteria. We use chemotaxis to improve the range of DNA messaging, increasing both transmission distance and communication bit rates relative to existing small molecule-based communication systems. We postulate that integration of different engineered cell-cell communication platforms will allow for more complex spatial programming of dynamic cellular consortia. </p...|$|R

30|$|The above {{results as}} well as our {{previous}} studies indicated that the major potential protein isoforms caused by Ds 1 exonization depend on the location of termination codons downstream the Ds 1 transposon. Type IV involves events in which PTCs in the original transcripts become in-frame in the simulated transcripts. Ds 1 inserted in introns would yield 11 different patterns of type IV transcripts of a single Ds 1 insertion site. In order to clarify the effect of Ds 1 exonization in type IV transcripts, we divided the outcomes into 3 groups: group D providing donor alone, group A providing acceptor alone; and group DA providing a donor and an acceptor. For type IV transcripts, the outcomes were termed 4 D 1, 4 D 2, 4 D 3 (when using donors only for exonization); 4 A 1, 4 A 2 (when using acceptor only for exonization); and D 1 A 1, D 1 A 2, D 2 A 1, D 2 A 2, D 3 A 1 and D 3 A 2. Among all type IV transcripts, about 51.4 % were non-NMD targets and would yield protein isoforms.
