2500|$|Debate in {{the colonies}} had {{actually}} begun {{in the spring of}} 1764 over the Stamp Act when Parliament passed a resolution that contained the assertion, [...] "That, towards further defraying the said Expences, it may be proper to charge certain Stamp Duties in the said Colonies and Plantations." [...] Both the Sugar Act and the proposed Stamp Act were designed principally to raise revenue from the colonists. [...] The Sugar Act, to a large extent, was a continuation of past legislation related primarily to the regulation of trade (termed an external tax), but its stated purpose was entirely new: to collect revenue directly from the colonists for a specific purpose. [...] The novelty of the Stamp Act was that it was the first <b>internal</b> <b>tax</b> (a tax based entirely on activities with{{in the colonies}}) levied directly on the colonies by Parliament. It was judged by the colonists to be a more dangerous assault on their rights than the Sugar Act was, because of its potential wide application to the colonial economy.|$|E

2500|$|Economist Daniel Klein {{believes}} {{using the}} term [...] "free market economics" [...] or [...] "free market economist" [...] to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the [...] "Smithian" [...] identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed {{that the government should}} subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an <b>internal</b> <b>tax</b> on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Franklin {{told the}} House of Commons that, [...] "I know that {{whenever}} the subject [...] {{has occurred in}} conversation where I have been present, it has {{appeared to be the}} opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented...An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an <b>internal</b> <b>tax</b> is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it." [...] James Otis Jr. reasoned that the legal liberties of British subjects meant that Parliament should, or could, only tax the colonists if they were actually represented in Westminster.|$|E

60|$|A. I {{think the}} {{difference}} is very great. An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty {{is added to the}} first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an <b>internal</b> <b>tax</b> is forced from the people without their consent, if not laid by their own representatives. The stamp-act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us, or ruin us by the consequences of refusing to pay it.|$|E

Organisational structure at the headquarters level was arranged based on regional activity whereby each activity was headed by a Director of Customs. The activities were the Prevention Division, Customs, <b>Internal</b> <b>Tax,</b> Research, Planning and Training, Revenue Collection as well as General Administration and Finance. The same applied at state level where each state in Malaysia were led by a Director of Customs.

25|$|In 1767, the Parliament {{passed the}} Townshend Acts which placed duties {{on a number}} of {{essential}} goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to <b>internal</b> <b>taxes</b> and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade. Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.|$|R
