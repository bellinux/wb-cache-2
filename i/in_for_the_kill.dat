25|$|Historians do {{not believe}} that Indian {{casualties}} approached the higher estimates. The Plains Indians rarely mounted a direct charge at a foe capable of defense. Rather, they struck at the rear and flanks of an opponent, using mounted mobility to probe for weaknesses and attempt to cause disorganization and panic, backing off if they encountered a stout defense, and closing <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill</b> when they could do so with little risk of heavy casualties.|$|E
50|$|Formosan {{dogs are}} {{particularly}} agile; {{they are known}} for their hopping skill, especially when they are hunting small animals, such as rats. When they are startled or trying to intimidate their target, they will hop sideways back and forth. Unlike Rottweilers and German Shepherds, Formosan dogs do not hold their bite on their target. This habit is adopted and may be traced back to early boar hunting. Taiwanese aborigines used 5-6 Formosan dogs to circle a wild boar, and each dog would work to wound the boar. They would release their bite once they had attacked it and wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next attack again and again until the boar was exhausted enough for their master to move <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final <b>kill.</b>|$|R
40|$|Publication date: 1 March 2014 This study {{highlights}} the Tantric threads within the transcendental religions of Asia that reveal the commanding role of encirclement as a mystical force. The cyanide capsule (kuppi) {{around the neck}} of every Tamil Tiger fighter was not only a tool of instrumental rationality as a binding force, but also a modality similar to a thāli (marriage bond necklace) and to participation in a velvi (religious animal sacrifice). It was thus embedded within Tamil cultural practice. Alongside the LTTE's politics of homage to its māvīrar (dead heroes), the kuppi sits beside numerous incidents in LTTE acts of mobilization or military actions where key functionaries approached deities in thanks or <b>in</b> preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill.</b> These practices highlight the inventive potential of liminal moments/spaces. We see this as modernized 'war magic'—a hybrid re-enchantment energizing a specific religious worldview. Michael Robert...|$|R
500|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} {{as to whether or}} not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her <b>in</b> place <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke. Gail Simone included the character's paralysis in a list of [...] "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability—the information broker, Oracle.|$|R

Clarke ordered Enterprise {{to finish her}} off while he turned Glasgow north again {{to look for the}} other damaged German vessels, particularly T25. Glasgow soon came across not T25 but Z27, drifting and silent. Closing to point-blank range, Glasgow fired, hitting the destroyer's magazines. The hit caused a large explosion which killed Erdmenger, his staff and the captain. At the same time Enterprise finished off T26 with a single torpedo and then moved <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill</b> on T25.

500|$|Later that year, Barbara Gordon {{appeared}} in Alan Moore's Batman: <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara {{in an attempt}} to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke exert a great impact on the character, the story {{has little to do with}} her. She is employed as a plot device to cement the Joker’s vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with Wizard, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it [...] "shallow and ill-conceived." [...] He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, [...] "I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, [...] "Len got back onto the phone and said, ‘Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'"

2500|$|<b>In</b> {{accounting}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>killed</b> during <b>the</b> battle, {{a number}} of matters need to be noted. [...] It is apparent that as the battle progressed, the Japanese were less inclined or less able to manage burial of their dead. At Gona, McCarthy reports that the Japanese had {{made no attempt to}} bury the dead, some of whom had been [...] "laying out for days". Milner reports that the [...] "stench" [...] was so bad that toward the end, [...] "the living had been driven to put on gas masks". [...] <b>In</b> accounting <b>for</b> Japanese dead, <b>the</b> principle references make no apparent mention of consulting Japanese records or otherwise accounting for Japanese burials. [...] McCarthy indicates that many dead may have been buried in collapsed bunkers and remained unaccounted for. [...] Bombardment possibly obliterated traces of many others. [...] Milner notes that there was a tendency of American units to 'double count' Japanese dead and, where there was a joint responsibility between Australian and American units for recording Japanese dead, Australian figures should be preferred.|$|R
40|$|When, {{at the end}} of {{the year}} 1915, both Einstein and Hilbert arrived at what were named the field {{equations}} of general relativity, both of them thought that their fundamental achievement entailed, inter alia, the realisation of a theory of gravitation whose underlying group was the group of general coordinate transformations. This group theoretical property was believed by Einstein to be a relevant one from a physical standpoint, because the general coordinates allowed to introduce reference frames not limited to the inertial reference frames that can be associated with the Minkowski coordinate systems, whose transformation group was perceived to be restricted to the Poincaré group. Two years later, however, Kretschmann published a paper in which the physical relevance of the group theoretical achievement in the general relativity of 1915 was denied. For Kretschmann, since any theory, whatever its physical content, can be rewritten in a generally covariant form, the group of general coordinate transformations is physically irrelevant. This is not <b>the</b> case, however, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group of the infinitesimal motions that bring the metric field <b>in</b> itself, namely, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Killing</b> group. This group is physically characteristic of any given spacetime theory, since it accounts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> local invariance properties of the considered manifold, i. e., for its "relativity postulate". In the present chapter it is shown what are <b>the</b> consequences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> physical interpretation of some of these solutions whose relativity postulate is of intermediate content, when Kretschmann's standpoint is consistently adhered to.

25|$|In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, {{written for}} the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is {{recorded}} about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill.</b> But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. <b>In</b> an interview <b>for</b> MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go <b>in.</b> Go <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill.</b> I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try to go into... It was just like me telling her, you sure you wanna go here with me? I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|R
25|$|The {{main event}} was a Survivor Series match where André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed, and Rick Rude faced WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera, and Bam Bam Bigelow. Muraco was not {{scheduled}} {{to compete in}} the match but replaced Billy Graham, who was originally scheduled to be Hogan's teammate but retired because of his hip injury suffered during a match against Reed. Hogan eliminated Reed after he hit a leg drop on Reed and pinned him to eliminate him first. Patera was eliminated after falling victim to One Man Gang's Flying Clothesline. Thereafter, Orndorff (who had recently turned face) and Rude began brawling to advance their feud over who had the better physique; Orndorff gotten the best of Rude until Bundy distracted him, allowing Rude to use a roll up to score the pin. Muraco (who had also recently turned face) joined the match and powerslammed Rude to eliminate him. One Man Gang entered and then hit Muraco with a 747 Splash to eliminate him, giving André's team a three–two advantage. One Mang Gang and Bundy began dominating Bigelow, when André was tagged <b>in</b> to go <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill.</b> However, Bigelow ducked an André punch and tagged in Hogan. Hogan immediately began getting the better of André and was setting up for a running elbow smash, when he was pulled out of the ring by Bundy; Hogan fought off both heels but was kept out of the ring long enough to be counted out. Hogan re-entered the ring to argue with the referees, but ring announcer Howard Finkel informed the crowd that if Hogan did not leave the ring immediately, Andre's team would win the match automatically. Bigelow—the lone remaining member of Hogan's team—fended for himself, using a Slingshot to eliminate Bundy, then pinning One Man Gang after he missed a 747 Splash. Bigelow eventually fell victim to André, who hit a butterfly suplex to win the match. After the match, Hogan returned to the ring and attacked André, hitting him with his title belt and knocking him from the ring.|$|R

After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill</b> and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{occasionally}} prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears a wide berth, {{though some}} specimens may become habitual bear killers {{and it is}} not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger scats. Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them by the back of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim's back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill.</b> When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear's claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger's presence before the pounce. A female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. Indian leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills.|$|E
25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the {{lightweight}} division in order to fight The Ring Lightweight Champion Joel Casamayor on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 2008, he defeated Casamayor in the 11th round after two knockdowns and captured his sixth world title in three different weight classes. In the first four rounds of the bout, Márquez continually walked into counter punches from Casamayor. It took Márquez until the fifth round {{to be able to}} find the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Márquez landed straight punches from the outside, but he was also struck by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right punch as he pulled away from an intense exchange. Casamayor was able to get on his feet, but it was clear he was still shakey from the knockdown. As soon as the action was allowed to resume, Márquez went <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kill</b> as he let his punches go in furious combination. Casamayor punched back, but he was knocked down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in the bout and stopped the fight as he deemed Casamayor unable to continue. The official judges had the fight scored 95–95, 95–95 and 97–93 for Márquez before the 11th-round knockout. After the win, The Ring magazine ranked Márquez second on its pound for pound list and rated him the number one boxer in the lightweight division.|$|E
