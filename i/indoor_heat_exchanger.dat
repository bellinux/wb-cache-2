30|$|The {{advanced}} {{control system}} seems to provide greater reductions in energy consumption {{than the usual}} balance point control. This is because both the heat pumps and the electric backup heating systems are powered with electricity and any time that a heat pump can be operated it will cost less than electric heat. Balance point control switches over to the conventional furnace when the heat pump can no longer provide the full heating. This switch occurs once the outdoor temperature is low enough that the home’s heat loss exceeds the heat pump’s capacity. While this is a simple control strategy to implement, it prevents energy from being saved {{due to the fact}} that the heat pump could still provide for part of the heating demand, while the electric furnace can supply the remainder.

In addition, high discharge temperature at the compressor discharge might limit {{the operation of the}} heat pump at very low ambient temperatures. Oil injected into the compression chamber {{at the beginning of the}} compression process can absorb part of the heat generated during the compression process, which can result in significant reduction of the compressor discharge temperature. Discharge temperature decreases with increasing injected oil mass fraction, especially at low ambient temperatures. Therefore, oil injection allows the application of air-source heat pumps in regions with very low ambient temperatures in winter. Additionally, oil injection decreases the compressor power consumption by providing better sealing and lower friction during the compression process. Furthermore, if oil injection is combined with a regenerative heat exchanger and an oil cooler, the system performance of a vapor compression system can be improved significantly.

The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction.

40|$|One of {{the major}} indeterminates in the design as well as {{operation}} of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is the rate of fouling a select <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry would exhibit over the operation cycles.

40|$|Conventional air {{conditioning}} (AC) systems have limited control of sensible cooling and latent cooling capacities; therefore additional energy-consuming devices, i. e. electric heaters, {{are often used}} to reheat the conditioned air {{in order to provide}} thermal comfort for the building occupants. Separate sensible and latent cooling (SSLC) AC systems are capable of providing better control of cooling at no extra overload in the form of energy input. Moreover, because of a higher coefficient of performance (COP) in the sensible cooling cycle, the SSLC technology reduces total energy input to vapor compression systems (VCS), and makes AC systems more energy efficient. This dissertation explores and compares two main methods for implementing the SSLC concept: cycle options for SSLC systems and methods of indoor heat transfer. One of these options consists of two independent VCS, and the other consists of one VCS removing sensible load only and one solid desiccant wheel (DW) regenerated with the waste heat from the VCS. The objectives of the system option study are to understand the reasons behind energy savings and explore the best possible configurations of SSLC systems in different summer outdoor conditions. The simulation results of the first kind of SSLC system show that the energy savings come from a reduced compressor power input of the sensible cycle. Under wide ranging ambient conditions, the amount of energy savings varies from 22 % to 50 % over conventional system energy input. However, such a system has limited independence of varying sensible to latent load ratio and the extra cost of an internal heat exchanger. The integration of VCS and DW overcomes these limitations. An experimental setup was constructed in an environmental chamber to test the performance of the second kind of SSLC system using carbon dioxide as refrigerant. The experimental results show only a 7 % improvement by using SSLC systems, and two negative factors hindering SSLC systems from achieving more energy savings were later identified. As a result, the application of divided heat exchangers is proposed as a solution to address one of the issues. An optimal SSLC system, which incorporates the application of divided heat exchangers, an enthalpy wheel and other energy-saving methods, was modeled and demonstrated a doubling of the COP as compared to a conventional AC system. The second method crucial to implementing SSLC is a so called "low &# 916;T indoor heat exchanger" which is being introduced as an improved sensible heat exchanger design for the successful implementation of SSLC system concept. Its capability of providing both radiative heat transfer and convective heat transfer leads to better thermal comfort to occupants. Compared to the baseline fan-coil unit, the low &# 916;T <b>indoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> creates better thermal comfort in terms of reducing temperature stratification from head to feet by 0. 8 K and providing higher operative temperature at the foot level in winter. Numerical models were developed to simulate the operative temperature field created by the low &# 916;T <b>indoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The model had only an average deviation of 0. 4 K compared to the experimental data. The air temperature simulation in the model was later replaced by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method.

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of performance and heating capacity of conventional air-to-air heat pumps decrease towards lower ambient temperatures. Heat pump systems are increasingly installed in residential homes but whereas they are already widespread in moderate climates, applications in very cold climates are limited. Since the heating load increases at low ambient temperatures, additional auxiliary heating systems are needed, which results in poor seasonal coefficients of performance. Oil-flooded compression is a technology to improve the performance of heat pump systems. This concept seeks to approach an isothermal compression process by injecting oil characterized by a higher specific heat than the refrigerant to absorb heat during the compression process. In a previous study (Yang et al. 2014), a 5 -ton (17. 6 kW) R 410 A packaged heat pump retrofitted with an oil injected compressor and regenerator was tested, in which one circuit within the <b>indoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was modified {{to serve as an}} oil cooler. Up to 8 % COP improvement was achieved for the oil flooded system relative to the baseline system. However, the heating capacity of the oil flooded system was found to be only slightly higher (1. 6 % to 3. 3 % improvement) than the baseline system. The potential of the oil flooded compression technology was not fully achieved due to the reduced heat transfer area of the condenser and unpredictable refrigerant flow maldistribution in the evaporator. The work presented in this paper shows the experimental results of a new prototype oil flooded system. This system has a different baseline configuration than the previous oil-flooded system in which the indoor coil face area is kept unchanged while an additional heat exchanger was added as the oil cooler. In addition, a new bigger counter-flow plate heat exchanger with low pressure drops was used as the regenerator. The results show that by injecting oil, the COP of the system was increased by 6. 1 % and the heating capacity by 5. 7 %. If the system is compared with a conventional heat pump (without regenerator and without oil injection), the COP improvement ranges from 4 % to 15 % depending on the oil mass fraction and operating temperature. The improvement in the heating capacity ranges from 0. 4 % up to 19 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{with the}} H-shape baffle support {{structure}} in shell-side is presented. Analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics {{were carried out}} with the segmental baffle, rod baffle and H-shape baffle support structures in shell-sides of shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> by adopting periodic numerical models. The characteristics in the three <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> were compared and discussed. It is shown that the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the H-shape baffle support structure combines the respective characteristics of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> with cross fluid flow and longitudinal fluid flow in shell-sides, and integrates advantages of both <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> On some operating conditions, the new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the H-shape baffle support structure has wide application prospect...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} several <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designs were constructed, tested, {{and the effect}} of the design on the overall {{efficiency}} and power generated by thermoelectric generators was measured. The thermoelectric elements were attached to the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and hot gas passed through the system simulating automotive exhaust. An aluminum duct <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> a copper <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> and a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with a twisted tape insertion were tested. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> were all rectangular with similar dimensions and minimum thicknesses near the wall. The flow of exhaust gas was created by heated air flow ranging from 100 - 150 LPM. The cool side <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was setup to simulate a coolant pump using ethylene glycol water mixture (automobile coolant). For measurements, all the thermocouples and thermoelectric generators were connected through the data acquisition program LabView. For the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designs the availability, cost effectiveness, implementation probability, and overall performance based on literature was considered. It was observed that due to the insertion of the tape, heat enhancement occurred. It was determined that the tape inside the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> reduced the diameter of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> which increased the velocity inside of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> thus increasing the overall heat transfer coefficient. This is confirmed by the overall increase in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> efficiency of nearly 48 % and output power generation of 31 % when compared...|$|R
