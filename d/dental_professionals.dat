25|$|The use {{of dental}} {{sealants}} {{is a means}} of prevention. A sealant is a thin plastic-like coating applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars to prevent food from being trapped inside pits and fissures. This deprives resident plaque bacteria of carbohydrate, preventing the formation of pit and fissure caries. Sealants are usually applied on the teeth of children, as soon as the teeth erupt but adults are receiving them if not previously performed. Sealants can wear out and fail to prevent access of food and plaque bacteria inside pits and fissures and need to be replaced so they must be checked regularly by <b>dental</b> <b>professionals.</b>|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many <b>dental</b> <b>professionals</b> include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, whereas topical fluoride, {{found in}} {{toothpaste}} and mouthwashes, {{does not cause}} fluorosis, its effects are now considered more important than those of systemic fluoride, such as when drinking fluorinated water. [...] However, systemic fluoride works topically as well with fluoride levels in saliva increase also when drinking fluoridated water. Lately, <b>dental</b> <b>professionals</b> are looking for other ways to present fluoride (such as in varnish) or other mineralizing products such as Amorphous calcium phosphate to the community {{in the form of}} topical procedures, either done by professionals or self-administered.

2500|$|Despite fluoridation's detractors, most <b>dental</b> <b>professionals</b> and {{organizations}} {{agree that the}} inclusion of fluoride in public water {{has been one of}} the most effective methods of decreasing the prevalence of tooth decay. Fluoride can be found in many locations naturally, such as the ocean and other water sources. The recommended dosage of fluoride in drinking water depends on air temperature. Fluoride catalyzes the diffusion of calcium and phosphate into the tooth surface, which in turn remineralizes the crystalline structures in a dental cavity. The remineralized tooth surfaces contain fluoridated hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite, which resist acid attack much better than the original tooth did [...] Fluoride therapy is used to help prevent dental decay.|$|E
2500|$|As to the {{frequency}} of cleaning, research on this matter is inconclusive. That is, it has neither been shown that more frequent cleaning leads to better outcomes nor that it does not. A review of the research literature on the question concluded [...] "he research evidence is not of sufficient quality to reach any conclusions regarding the beneficial and adverse effects of routine scaling and polishing for periodontal health and regarding the effects of providing this intervention at different time intervals". Thus, any general recommendation for a frequency of routine cleaning (e.g. every six months, every year) has no empirical basis. Moreover, as economists have pointed out, private dentists (or other <b>dental</b> <b>professionals)</b> have an economic incentive to recommend frequent cleaning, because it increases their revenues.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{groups of}} people have spoken out against fluoridated {{drinking}} water, for reasons such as the neurotoxicity of fluoride or the damage fluoride can do as fluorosis. Fluorosis is a condition resulting from the overexposure to fluoride, especially {{between the ages of}} 6nbsp&months and 5nbsp&years, and appears as mottled enamel. [...] Consequently, the teeth look unsightly, although the incidence of dental decay in those teeth is very small. Where fluoride is found naturally in high concentrations, filters are often used to decrease the amount of fluoride in water. For this reason, codes have been developed by <b>dental</b> <b>professionals</b> to limit the amount of fluoride a person should take.

2500|$|An {{example of}} an ASA status {{classification}} system is that used by <b>dental</b> <b>professionals.</b> [...] Many include the 'functional limitation' or 'anxiety' to determine classification which is {{not mentioned in the}} actual definition but may prove to be beneficial when dealing with certain complex cases. Often different anesthesia providers assign different grades to the same case. The word 'systemic' in this classification creates a lot of confusion. For example, heart attack (myocardial infarction), though grave, is a 'local' disease and is not a 'systemic' disease, so a recent (or old) heart attack, {{in the absence of any}} other systemic disease, does not truly fit in any category of the ASA classification, yet has poor post-surgery survival rates. [...] Similarly cirrhosis of the liver, COPD, severe asthma, peri-nephric abscess, badly infected wounds, intestinal perforation, skull fracture etc. are not systemic diseases. [...] These, and other severe heart, liver, lung, intestinal or kidney diseases, although they greatly affect physical status and risk for poor outcomes, cannot be labelled as “systemic disease” (which means a generalized disorder of the whole body like hypertension or diabetes mellitus). Local diseases can also change physical status but has not been mentioned in ASA classification.|$|E
2500|$|Dentists {{and dental}} hygienists measure {{periodontal}} disease using a device called a periodontal probe. [...] This thin [...] "measuring stick" [...] is gently placed {{into the space}} between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline. [...] If the probe can slip more than [...] below the gumline, the patient is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred. [...] This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket. [...] However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the patient, with a toothbrush) if they are 3mm or less in depth. [...] This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought. [...] When the pocket depths reach [...] in depth, the hand instruments and cavitrons used by the <b>dental</b> <b>professionals</b> may not reach deeply enough into the pocket to clean out the microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth. [...] An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the patient to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as minocycline) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the patient at home with his or her toothbrush.|$|E

Methods: Population-based data from the 2001 Australian National Health Survey were analysed.
