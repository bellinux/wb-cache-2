40|$|The {{integration}} protein (IN) of the Prague A {{strain of}} Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was analyzed by high-resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three polypeptides of similar proportions and molecular mass (32 kDa) were immunoprecipitated by an antiserum {{directed against the}} first 10 amino acids of the amino terminus of IN. However, the faster-migrating nonphosphorylated polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated by two different polyclonal antisera directed against the last 11 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of IN. These {{results suggest that the}} faster-migrating species was proteolytically processed at its carboxyl terminus. RSV IN is phosphorylated on an <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> located five amino acids from its carboxyl terminus. Two different missense mutations at this <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> resulted in the isolation of slow-growing viable mutants whose phenotypes were stable. Each mutation at residue 282 eliminated both major phosphorylated-Ser-containing tryptic peptides observed with wild-type IN. An S-*F mutation resulted in the conversion of all IN polypeptides to one species that was not precipitable by carboxyl-terminal antisera, suggesting that this amino acid transition promoted proteolysis at the carboxyl terminus. An S-*D mutation resulted in the recovery of one major (> 95 %) slower-migrating polypeptide that was immunoprecipitated by carboxyl-terminal antisera, suggesting that this negatively charged D residue (similar to phosphorylated Ser) inhibited proteolysis.

40|$|Invariant {{rotational}} tori play {{an important}} role in the dynamics of volume-preserving maps. When integrable, all orbits lie on these tori and KAM theory guarantees the persistence of some tori upon perturbation. When these tori have codimension-one they act as boundaries to transport, and therefore play a prominent role in the global stability of the system. For the area-preserving case, Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion is often used to predict the destruction of tori from the properties of nearby periodic orbits. Even though KAM theory applies to the three-dimensional case, the robustness of tori in such systems is still poorly understood. This dissertation begins by extending Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion to three-dimensional, reversible, volume-preserving maps. The application of Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion requires the repeated computation of periodic orbits, which is costly if the system is nonreversible. We describe a quasi-Newton, Fourier-based scheme to numerically compute the conjugacy of a torus and demonstrate how the growth of the Sobolev norm or singular values of this conjugacy can be used to predict criticality. We will then use this method to study both reversible and nonreversible volume-preserving maps in two and three dimensions. The near-critical conjugacies, and the gaps that form within them, will be explored in the context of Aubry-Mather and Anti-Integrability theory, when applicable. This dissertation will conclude by exploring the locally and globally most robust tori in area-preserving maps...|$|R

By taking advantage of increased dispersion of resonances for the anomeric H 1 protons at low pD and the superior resolution of band-selective, homonuclear-decoupled (BASHD) two-dimensional 1 H NMR, the primary structure of the heparin-derived octasaccharide ∆UA(2 S) -[(1 [*]→[*] 4) -GlcNS(6 S) -(1 [*]→[*] 4) -IdoA(2 S) -] 3 -(1 [*]→[*] 4) -GlcNS(6 S) has been determined, where ∆UA(2 S) is 2 -O-sulfated ∆ 4, 5 -unsaturated uronic acid, GlcNS(6 S) is 6 -O-sulfated, N-sulfated β-d-glucosamine and IdoA(2 S) is 2 -O-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid. The spectrum was assigned, and the sites of N- and O-sulfation and the conformation of each uronic acid residue were established, with chemical shift data obtained from BASHD-TOCSY spectra, while the sequence of the monosaccharide residues in the octasaccharide was determined from inter-residue NOEs in BASHD-NOESY spectra. Acid dissociation constants were determined for each carboxylic acid group of the octasaccharide, as well as for related tetra- and hexasaccharides, from chemical shift–pD titration curves.

Further analysis of the disaccharide products by ion-exchange chromatography and comparison with the data from single enzymatic digestions, allowed an estimate of the disaccharide composition to be made. The results suggest an ordered arrangement of structural domains; however, variations in the structure of these domains results in a heterogeneous population of HS chains.

To expand knowledge about structure-function relationships in homologous protein S molecules, studies of protein S from different species have been performed. Protein S anti-coagulant activity in human, monkey, bovine, and porcine plasma has been inactivated by purified human C 4 b binding protein (C 4 BP) with dose-dependence, suggesting that each protein S can bind human C 4 BP and that only the free form of each is anti-coagulantly active.

To address whether residues 720 – 765 of the II-III loop are sufficient to enable skeletal-type (Ca 2 + entry-independent) EC coupling and retrograde interaction with RyR 1, we constructed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged chimera (GFP-SkLM) having rabbit skeletal (Sk) DHPR sequence except for a II-III loop (L) from the DHPR of the house fly, Musca domestica (M). The Musca II-III loop (75 % dissimilarity to α 1 S) has no similarity to α 1 S in the regions R 681 –L 690 and L 720 –Q 765. GFP-SkLM expressed in dysgenic myotubes (which lack endogenous α 1 S subunits) was unable to restore EC coupling and displayed strongly reduced Ca 2 + current densities despite normal surface expression levels and correct triad targeting (colocalization with RyR 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT Central to NF-B {{signaling}} pathways is IKK/NEMO, {{a regulatory}} subunit of the cytoplasmic IB kinase (IKK) com-plex, which undergoes various posttranslational modifications, specifically phosphorylation, to regulate its function. Further-more, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) FADD-like interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibi-tory protein (vFLIP) activates the NF-B signaling pathway by directly interacting with IKK/NEMO. However, the exact functions of IKK/NEMO phosphorylation and its KvFLIP interaction in NF-B activation remain elusive. Here, we report two novel phosphorylation sites of IKK/NEMO and their {{negative effect on}} the IKK/NEMO-mediated NF-B signaling pathway. First, the Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SF-PTKs), including Src, Fyn, Lyn, and Fgr, interact with and phosphorylate ty-rosine residue 374 (Y 374) of IKK/NEMO. Mutation of the Y 374 residue to phenylalanine (Y 374 F) specifically abolished SF-PTK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) -induced NF-B activity. Moreover, our mass spectrometry analysis found that the serine 377 <b>residue</b> (<b>S</b> 377) of IKK/NEMO underwent robust phos-phorylation upon KvFLIP expression.

We report here {{a new type}} of regulation that influences Cdk recognition and phosphorylation of substrate proteins, mediated through the targeted methylation of {{a critical}} lysine residue in the Cdk substrate recognition site. In pRb, lysine (K) 810 represents the essential and conserved basic residue (SPXK) required for cyclin/Cdk recognition and phosphorylation. Methylation of K 810 by the methyltransferase Set 7 / 9 impedes binding of Cdk and thereby prevents subsequent phosphorylation of the associated serine (<b>S)</b> <b>residue,</b> retaining pRb in the hypophosphorylated growth-suppressing state. Methylation of K 810 is under DNA damage control, and methylated K 810 impacts on phosphorylation at sites throughout the pRb protein.

NOE-based conformational modelling has been done by using the iterative relaxation matrix approach (IRMA), restrained molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization to refine structures and to distinguish between minor structural differences and equilibria between various ring forms. Both glucosamine residues B and D are in the 4 C 1 chair conformation. The 6 -O-sulphate group is oriented in the gauche-trans configuration in the D ring, whereas in the B ring the gauche-gauche rotomer predominates. Uronate (A) and iduronate (C) residues are mostly represented by 1 H 2 and 2 S 0 twisted boat forms, respectively, with small deviations in expected coupling constants and NOEs suggesting minor contributions from other A and C ring conformations...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the mutations at the hydrophobic residues I 167 and F 212, the mutations at polar amino acid <b>residues</b> <b>S</b> 168, N 173 and Q 178 did not exhibit significantly reduced activity (Table  2). In these mutations, the Km values are decreased and the kcat values are decreased, meaning that the affinities of the mutants are increased but the rates of the catalysis are decreased. The higher affinities of S 168 A, N 173 A and Q 178 A {{may be due to}} the increase of hydrophobicity favorable for the substrate binding. The reductions of the kcat value of these mutants suggest that the hydrogen network including catalytic <b>residue</b> <b>S</b> 166 may be favorable for the reaction (Figure  4).|$|R
40|$|AbstractMolecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulations {{have been}} carried out on bundles of the channel-forming transmembrane (TM) domain of the viral protein U (VPU 1 – 27 and VPU 6 – 27) from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1). Simulations of hexameric and pentameric bundles of VPU 6 – 27 in an octane/water membrane mimetic system suggested that the pentamer is the preferred oligomer. Accordingly, an unconstrained pentameric helix bundle of VPU 1 – 27 was then placed in a hydrated palmitoyl-oleyl- 3 -n-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) lipid bilayer and its structural properties calculated from a 3 -ns MD run. Some water molecules, initially inside the channel lumen, were expelled halfway through the simulation and the bundle adopted a conical structure reminiscent of previous MD results obtained for VPU 6 – 27 in an octane/water system. The pore constriction generated may correspond to a closed state of the channel and underlies the relocation of the W residue toward the pore lumen. The relative positions of the helices with respect to the bilayer and their interactions with the lipids are discussed. The observed structure is stabilized via specific interactions between the VPU helices and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the lipid molecules, particularly at the Q and <b>S</b> <b>residues...</b>|$|R
40|$|The spike (S) protein {{of severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates viral entry into target cells. Cleavage and activation of SARS S {{by a host}} cell protease is essential for infectious viral entry and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS 2 cleaves and activates SARS S in cell culture and potentially also in the infected host. Here, we investigated which determinants in SARS S control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS 2. We found that SARS <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> R 667, a previously identified trypsin cleavage site, is also required for S protein cleavage by TMPRSS 2. The cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS 2 differed in their decoration with N-glycans, suggesting that these proteases cleave different SARS S glycoforms. Although R 667 was required for SARS S cleavage by TMPRSS 2, this residue was dispensable for TMPRSS 2 -mediated S protein activation. Conversely, residue R 797, previously reported to be required for SARS S activation by trypsin, was dispensable for S protein cleavage but required for S protein activation by TMPRSS 2. Collectively, these results show that different <b>residues</b> in SARS <b>S</b> control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS 2, suggesting that these processes are more complex than initially appreciated...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{characterization of}} glycosaminoglycans (GAG) oligosaccharides {{has been a}} long-standing challenge {{in the field of}} mass spectrometry. In this work, we present the application of electron detachment dissociation (EDD) Fourier transform mass spectrometry to the analysis of dermatan sulfate (DS) oligosaccharides up to 10 residues long. The EDD mass spectra of DS oligosaccharides were compared with their infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) mass spectra. EDD produces more abundant fragmentation than IRMPD with far less loss of SO 3 from labile sulfate modifications. EDD cleaves all glycosidic bonds, yielding both conventional glycosidic bond fragmentation as well as satellite peaks resulting from the additional loss of 1 or 2 hydrogen atoms. EDD also yields more cross-ring fragmentation than IRMPD. For EDD, abundant cross-ring fragmentation in the form of A- and X-ions is observed, with 1, 5 Xn cleavages occurring for all IdoA residues and many of the GalNAc 4 <b>S</b> <b>residues,</b> except at the reducing and nonreducing ends. In contrast, IRMPD produces only A-type cross-ring fragmentation for long oligosaccharides (dp 6 –dp 10). As all the structurally informative fragment ions observed by IRMPD appear as a subset of the peaks found in the EDD mass spectrum, EDD shows great potential for the characterization of GAG oligosaccharides using a single tandem mass spectrometry experiment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addressed}} whether phosphorylation regulates trafficking of yeast membrane {{proteins that}} cycle between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomal system. The TGN membrane proteins A-ALP, a model protein containing the Ste 13 p cytosolic domain fused to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Kex 2 p {{were found to}} be phosphorylated in vivo. Mutation of the <b>S</b> 13 <b>residue</b> on the cytosolic domain of A-ALP to Ala was found to block trafficking to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC), whereas a S 13 D mutation generated to mimic phosphorylation accelerated trafficking into the PVC. The <b>S</b> 13 <b>residue</b> was shown by mass spectrometry to be phosphorylated. The rate of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of newly synthesized A(S 13 A) -ALP was indistinguishable from wild-type, indicating that the lack of transport of A(S 13 A) -ALP to the PVC was instead due to differences in Golgi/endosomal trafficking. The A(S 13 A) -ALP protein exhibited a TGN-like localization similar to that of wild-type A-ALP. Similarly, the S 13 A mutation in endogenous Ste 13 p did not reduce the extent of or longevity of its localization to the TGN as shown by α-factor processing assays. These results indicate that S 13 phosphorylation is required for TGN-to-PVC trafficking of A-ALP and imply that phosphorylation of S 13 may regulate recognition of A-ALP by vesicular trafficking machinery...|$|R
