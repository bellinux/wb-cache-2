5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. <b>His</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|Brunel died in 1859, {{without seeing}} the {{completion}} of the bridge. <b>His</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished {{to make way for a}} new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized {{control of the state}} itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E

5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A rebel leader {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant {{young man who had}} once been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E

25|$|When David E. Bonior {{resigned}} as Minority Whip in early 2002, Hoyer ran but lost to Nancy Pelosi.

25|$|The Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, took a {{much more}} {{moderate}} line on the issue than many of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> governing New Democracy party. Despite opposition from hardliners, he endorsed the proposal in March 1993. The acceptance of the formula by Athens also led to the reluctant acquiescence {{of the government in}} Skopje, though it too was divided between moderates and hardliners on the issue.|$|E

25|$|Xenopol was {{the author}} of two {{realistic}} novels criticizing the social environment of his day. His campaign for realism and his positive coverage of urban civilization pitted him against the conservative author Mihai Eminescu. Their violent debate of the 1880s is one of the highlights in Xenopol's career in cultural journalism. His passionate involvement in support of the liberal cause was another topic of controversy, and, on several occasions, he dueled with <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press.|$|E

25|$|Accounts differ {{as to what}} {{happened}} next. According to one version, he was sentenced to death, but his penalty was commuted to hard labor.

25|$|Winston Churchill and the British cabinet {{had been}} {{applying}} {{pressure on the}} Provisional Government to dislodge the rebels in Four Courts, as they considered their presence {{a violation of the}} Treaty. Such pressure fell heaviest on Michael Collins, President of the Provisional Government Cabinet and effective head of the regular National Army. Collins, a chief IRA strategist during the War of Independence from Britain, had resisted giving open battle to the anti-Treaty militants since they had first occupied Four Courts the preceding April. <b>His</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Provisional Government Cabinet, including Arthur Griffith, agreed that Collins must mount decisive military action against them.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the work}} on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were {{probably}} some of the most frustrating for von Braun and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program.
