The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses.</b> Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
