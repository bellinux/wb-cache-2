5|$|When {{the first}} neutral atoms formed from {{a sea of}} {{primordial}} ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation.

50|$|The Star Wars <b>expanded</b> <b>universe</b> (SWEU; {{formerly}} branded as <b>Expanded</b> <b>Universe</b> or EU) is {{a collective}} term for all Star Wars fictional material produced by Lucasfilm or officially licensed by it. This <b>expanded</b> <b>universe</b> includes {{an array of}} derivative Star Wars works produced in conjunction with, between, and after the original trilogy (1977-1983) and prequel trilogy (1999-2005) of films, and includes books, comic books, video games, and television series. Intended as an enhancement to and extension of the Star Wars theatrical films produced by George Lucas, the continuity of all <b>Expanded</b> <b>Universe</b> material was tracked by Lucasfilm, and Lucas reserved the right to both draw on it and contradict {{it in his own}} works.|$|R

5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an <b>expanding</b> <b>universe</b> could {{be traced back}} in time to an {{originating}} single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an <b>expanding</b> <b>universe.</b> In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} types of horizons. In an <b>expanding</b> <b>universe,</b> an {{observer}} may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed ("particle horizon"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon). Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer (Rindler space), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as Unruh radiation.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the <b>expanding</b> <b>universe,</b> the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This {{receding}} is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Ubiquitousness and {{stability}} of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature {{is much higher than}} ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination, when the <b>expanding</b> <b>Universe</b> cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the <b>expanding</b> <b>Universe.</b> Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently <b>expanding</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E

25|$|He goes on {{to explain}} that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an <b>expanding</b> <b>universe.</b> He further {{explains}} that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an <b>expanding</b> <b>universe.</b> In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist.
