500|$|In 1923, Frederick Treves {{published}} a volume, The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, {{in which he}} detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions. This account {{is the source of}} much of what is known about Merrick, but there were several inaccuracies in the book. Merrick never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves's Reminiscences. A more mysterious error is that of Merrick's first name. Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, insisted on calling him John Merrick. The reason for this is unclear; Merrick clearly signed his name as [...] "Joseph" [...] in the examples of his handwriting that remain. In the handwritten manuscript for The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, Treves began his account by writing [...] "Joseph" [...] and then crossed it out and replaced it with [...] "John". Whatever the reason for the error, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> persisted throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers who based their work on Treves's book have continued the error.|$|E
500|$|Lifesong {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kim Jones of About.com gave it {{five out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Bottom line - my hat goes off to Casting Crowns for a job well done, once again. This is one band that doesn't soft-pedal their message, even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> people enjoying a [...] "comfort-zone" [...] {{may not want to}} hear". Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "One of the brightest spots on the CCM map in 2005, Lifesong was powered by a second dose of Mark Hall's earnestly challenging worship themes and a penchant for reflective pop... From start to finish, the album showcases songwriting that is consistent, polished, and potent, furthering the septet's reputation as one of Christian music's most popular acts of the 21st century". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard said that [...] "there is no sophomore letdown here for Casting Crowns... This is intelligent, soulful music that goes beyond mere entertainment to something deeper". David McCreary of CCM Magazine gave Lifesong an A-, opining [...] "staying true to their approach of assimilating crisp melodies, forthright lyrics and stout vocals, the Crowns effectively blend uptempo worship anthems and emotive ballads for another well-balanced set". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, calling the music [...] "derivative", said that [...] " [...] fans will find much to love, while others continue to ponder the secret of this band's success. All can probably agree that Lifesong is a sequel in the truest sense, offering more of the same to the delight of those so touched and inspired by the music of Casting Crowns the first time".|$|E

2500|$|To {{go along}} with the {{installation}} of the new video board and sound system prior to the 2011 football season, a tornado siren is sounded after touchdowns, defensive stands, and other big plays. [...] While the tornado siren is a new tradition, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> numerous Cyclones fans have asked the Iowa State athletic director to implement for many years, especially since the Colorado-Iowa State game of November 12, 2005, when a tornado touched down in Ames and sirens were heard throughout town during what normally would have been pregame activities. [...] Since then, its implementation has become an extremely popular aspect of the Jack Trice Stadium experience.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936 David and {{his brother}} Richard {{attended}} a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was [...] "bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of {{the flora and fauna}} of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day." [...] In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled Grey Owl.|$|E

50|$|Worland {{experiences}} an arid climate (Köppen BWk), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that’s</b> quite {{contrary to}} much of the state. Due to the location within the Big Horn Basin, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> protected from severe weather by the surrounding mountains from nearly every direction. This topography results in weather that is quite temperate with dry winters, little rainfall and few storms.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} in Llantrisant is firmly based in the varied religious institutions and Sunday School services which rapidly flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries.

2500|$|When {{not bound}} to netrin-1, [...] an {{intracellular}} domain of DCC is cleaved by a caspase, and induces apoptosis in a caspase-9-dependent pathway. This domain does {{not correspond to}} a known caspase recruitment motif or death sequence domain, but is required to initiate apoptosis. It has been theorized that the domain acts as a scaffold to recruit and activate caspase-9 and caspase-3. This DCC apoptosis pathway is not dependent on either the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway or the death receptor/caspase-8 pathway. In the absence of ligand, DCC interacts with caspase-9 (likely via an unidentified adaptor protein) and promotes the assembly of a caspase-activating complex. This causes the activation of caspase-3 through caspase-9, and initiates apoptosis without {{the formation of an}} apoptosome or cytochrome c release. This implies that DCC regulates a novel pathway for caspase activation, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is apoptosome-independent.|$|E
2500|$|Variety {{noted the}} show's appeal to all ages with its [...] "sense of wit and irreverence." [...] Similar reviews have {{emphasized}} the series' popularity with adults; Elastic Pops Rebecca Wright wrote, in a review for the volume one DVD, [...] "As an adult, I really enjoyed watching this Phineas and Ferb DVD, and I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the whole family can enjoy." [...] Wright also called the series' [...] "irreverent style" [...] reminiscent of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Wireds Matt Blum has stated in reviews on the series that he [...] "can stand to watch just about anything with (his) kids, but he actually looks forward to watching Phineas and Ferb with them." [...] Notable adult celebrities who have openly considered themselves fans of the series include Bob Eubanks, Anthony LaPaglia, Ben Stiller, Chaka Khan, Jeff Sullivan and Jake Gyllenhaal.|$|E
2500|$|What exactly {{constitutes}} an adjournment {{for the purposes}} of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the Pocket Veto Case (1929), the Supreme Court held that [...] "the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed." [...] Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In Wright v. United States (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.|$|E
