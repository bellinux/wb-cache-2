This version includes the original retail version of the game, along with the Spec 2.0 update already installed, plus vouchers for the game's DLC that was released in 2011. This version also has an alternative box art: Instead of the Le Mans Red Mercedes SLS AMG, the same car is now painted silver, and the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> features two screenshots of the Red Bull X2011 Race Car (which is featured as DLC, itself being an evolved, faster form of the Red Bull X2010 featured in the game as well), which can be flipped and used as the front box cover.|$|E
25|$|The early 1940s Shadow {{newspaper}} daily strip was {{reprinted by}} Avalon Communications under their ACG Classix imprint. The Shadow daily began {{appearing in the}} first issue of Pulp Action comics. It carried no monthly date or issue number on the cover, only a 1999 copyright and a Pulp Action #1 notation {{at the bottom of the}} <b>inside</b> <b>cover.</b> Each issue's cover is a colorized panel blow-up, taken from one of the reprinted strips. The eighth issue uses for its cover a Shadow serial black-and-white film still, with several hand-drawn alterations. The first issue of Pulp Action is devoted entirely to reprinting the Shadow daily, but subsequent issues began offering back-up stories not involving The Shadow in every issue. These Shadow strip reprints stopped with Pulp Actions eighth issue, before the story was complete; the last issue carries a 2000 copyright date.|$|E

25|$|The cross {{design is}} a slender {{elongated}} {{form of the}} Iron Cross or cross pattée and very similar in design to the Marian Cross of the Teutonic Knights Order (Marianerkreuz des Deutschen Ritterordens), enamelled translucent-blue with a slim opaque-white border. Resting on the centre radiant starburst rays is a metal roundel decorated with the words ”DER DEUTSCHEN MUTTER” (In English: TO THE GERMAN MOTHER) around an enamelled black straight centred “swastika” symbol, infilled white enamel. The cross design {{was the creation of}} the established Munich-based architect and sculptor Franz Berberich. The production of the cross involved several established Präsidialkanzlei (Presidential Chancellery) approved medal makers from across the German Reich. A maker’s mark was never applied to the crosses produced; though each official house of manufacture did apply their name to the dark-blue presentation case (<b>inside</b> <b>cover)</b> for the 1st Class Gold Cross and the presentation sachets (reverse side) for each of the 2nd and 3rd Class Cross.|$|E

500|$|Salford Lads Club is a {{recreational}} club established in 1903 and located in Ordsall. It is a listed building and gained international fame in 1986 when the pop band The Smiths posed {{in front of}} it for the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> of their album The Queen Is Dead. A report by English Heritage said [...] "The building is thought to be the most complete example of this rare form of social provision to survive in England."

500|$|According to an 18th-century Latin {{inscription}} pasted to the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> of the manuscript, the St Cuthbert Gospel {{was given}} by the 3rd Earl of Lichfield (1718–1772) to the Jesuit priest Thomas Phillips S.J. (1708–1774) who donated it to the English Jesuit College at Liège on 20 June 1769. [...] Lichfield was an Anglican, but knew Phillips as the latter was chaplain to his neighbour in Oxfordshire, the recusant George Talbot, 14th Earl of Shrewsbury (1719–1787). [...] The manuscript was owned between 1769 and 2012 by the British Province of the Society of Jesus, {{and for most of}} this period was in the library of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, successor to the Liège college.|$|E
500|$|Eric Duvauchelle, who {{was then}} part of Roc-A-Fella's {{in-house}} brand design team, was assigned for the artwork of The College Dropout. West had already taken pictures dressed as the Dropout Bear - which would reappear in his later work - and Duvauchelle picked the image of him sitting {{on a set of}} bleachers, as he got attracted to the loneliness of {{what was supposed to be}} [...] "the most popular representation of a school". The image is framed inside gold ornaments, which Duvauchelle found in a book of illustrations from the 16th-century and West wanted to use to [...] "bring a sense of elegance and style to what was typically a gangster-led image of rap artists". The <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> follows a college yearbook, with photos of the featured artists of the albums from their youth.|$|E

500|$|The album's cover art {{shows an}} empty road {{underneath}} a bright blue sky with a yield {{sign on the}} right-hand side of the road. The front cover art image was taken from a photograph of a road outside Billings, Montana, while the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> depicts the yield sign {{in the middle of the}} ocean. The cover of the cassette version mirrored the image. A yield sign is hidden in every picture of the liner notes booklet. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, Yield received a nomination for Best Recording Package. Ament said that the cover came from the idea on [...] "how cool to have a yield sign where there's nothing to yield to", and the place was a road on the way to his Montana home which he considered perfect for the photo.|$|E
500|$|A Link Between Worlds {{released}} in Europe and North America on November 22, 2013, in Australia the following day, {{and later in}} Japan on December 26, 2013.

Alongside the game's launch, Nintendo released a bundle including {{a copy of the}} game and a themed Nintendo 3DS XL with the Triforce logo on. In 2015, A Link Between Worlds was re-released under the Nintendo Selects label in Europe, along with five other Nintendo 3DS titles. In early 2015, Nintendo released the original soundtrack for A Link Between Worlds on CD in Europe via Club Nintendo. Music from the soundtrack was included in the 2015 concert tour [...] "".|$|E
500|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{released}} in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the <b>inside</b> <b>cover,</b> the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: [...] "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery... The songs are poor in general... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." [...] Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as {{a return to the}} band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: [...] "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all." [...] Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo effort.|$|E

500|$|Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments {{developed}} from her award-winning live television special in 1973 {{with the same}} title. Originally, Streisand had requested that her performance would be accompanied by several of [...] "the world's greatest musicians", with Streisand listing Pablo Casals, Isaac Stern, and James Galway as examples; instead, Columbia Records had her sing the music of different countries. They also made Streisand select one musician to work with for the project, and she picked Ray Charles. Recorded in London, the album was {{released to the public}} several months later. Allison J. Waldman, author of The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook, claimed that the singer used this appearance to [...] "update her image and her music" [...] which would be more appealing for the general public. Promotional efforts for the album included advertisements that described it as [...] "the most special Barbra on record". The photography created for the album cover was tackled by Baron Wolman while Paul Perlow designed the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> and liner notes.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover {{art is a}} {{modified}} Hubble Space Telescope photo of the planetary nebula MyCn 18, popularly known as the Hourglass Nebula. Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the <b>inside</b> <b>cover</b> and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule. I think for me the whole space theme {{has a lot to do}} with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture." ...|$|E
