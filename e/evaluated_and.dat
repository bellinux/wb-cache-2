The horse's movement, balance and disposition are <b>evaluated</b> <b>and</b> given 4 to 10 points.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) {{products}} are being increasingly {{used in the}} world of software development. Therefore, <b>evaluating</b> <b>and</b> selecting appropriate COTS product {{is one of the most}} critical activities in COTS-based system development. Unfortunately, many methods that have been proposed in previous studies for <b>evaluating</b> <b>and</b> selecting COTS software are still have many limitations and lack to apply and accept as a formal method in the industry. So without an effective method for <b>evaluating</b> <b>and</b> selecting COTS products, the time spent on selecting the suitable COTS software may offset the advantages of using it. This paper outlines and discusses the common problems in existing methods and presents the main processes and evaluation criteria (nonfunctional requirements) that are required for <b>evaluating</b> <b>and</b> selecting COTS software through theoretical and empirical studies which goal is to develop new framework to <b>evaluate</b> <b>and</b> select COTS software...|$|R

Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E

The list {{was composed of}} 50 student athletes who, based on 2007–08's individual performance and team records, were the early frontrunners for college basketball's most coveted trophy. These top 50 candidates were returning players. Transfers, freshmen, and medical red-shirts were not eligible for this preseason list, but were <b>evaluated</b> <b>and</b> considered for both the Midseason Top 30 list and the National Ballot. The Big Ten was represented by Purdue's Hummel, Wisconsin's Landry and Michigan State's Morgan.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being <b>evaluated,</b> <b>and</b> that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is <b>evaluated,</b> <b>and</b> if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic.|$|E

For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being <b>evaluated</b> <b>and</b> approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
