However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E

In their siege of Constantinople, they constructed walls of circumvallation to prevent easy counterattack and used mantelets or wooden frames covered with animal hides {{to protect against}} defending archers. Furthermore, like many nomads, they gathered other warriors such as Gepids and Slavs to assist them.

5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company did not believe in it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to determine whether a game was good or not.

5|$|The {{defenders}} {{expected the}} German and Ottoman attack {{to be one}} of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make it very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was totally committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E

The player's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to Space Invaders {{and the right}} hand pushes buttons similar to Asteroids. The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids, with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate {{on the far right}} and left, respectively.

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{to compete for the}} relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Singapore underwent several significant changes. Non-Constituency Members of Parliament {{were introduced in}} 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. Nominated Members of Parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs. The Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected President who has veto power {{in the use of}} national reserves and appointments to public office. The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore, and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties.|$|E

Norway Airlines lost NOK12 million in 1990. In January 1991, the airline won {{the contract to}} fly personnel the Norwegian Armed Forces, as the airline priced half a million krone lower than Busy Bee. Operations started in April and secured sufficient business that the airline could order its third aircraft, along with a contract from Gullivers Reiser for additional charter flights. Within a week it received concession to operate scheduled flights between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. A similar concession was also granted to Braathens SAFE, but they stated that the intense competition on the route would make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to start a service. However, the five-year concession required that Norway Airlines not have any foreign citizens in the board; as two representatives for ILG sat on the board, {{they would have to}} resign for the concession to be valid.

5|$|The {{only way}} Germany could acquire {{large numbers of}} horses after the war began was by conquest. More than 375,000horses were taken from German-occupied French {{territory}} {{for use by the}} German military. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000. The Ardennes was used to pull artillery for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant. The Germans were not able to capture the horses belonging to the Belgian royal family, as they were successfully evacuated, although they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis in Belgium the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction. Prevented by the Allies from importing remounts, the Germans ultimately ran out of horses, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to move supplies and artillery, a factor contributing to their defeat.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
