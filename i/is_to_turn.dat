It is one of 47 members of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (known as The Wildlife Trusts), {{each of which is}} a local nature conservation charity for its area. The Trust aims to protect London's wildlife and wild spaces, and it manages over 40 nature reserves in Greater London. One of its campaigns <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> London's gardens into mini-nature reserves, and it provides education services for schools. Local groups work on reserves and organise walks.|$|E

25|$|It is {{even more}} tragic that other world leaders who witness {{repression}} pretend it is not happening, or is exaggerated. When history eventually deals with the dictators, those who stood by and watched should also bear the consequences.

25|$|Fiercely {{territorial}} as some Indios fans are, {{a common}} practice {{for many of them}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the volume down on television broadcasts featuring the Indios, and turning a radio set on to the official Indios radio broadcast, which is aired on station WYEL-AM (600kHz) and streamcasted over the Internet.

25|$|Vertical {{air mixing}} {{was invented by}} Erik Uppstu. His idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved mixing results. Vertical air has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical air mixing, primary air supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{alternatives}} are available when starting from Mungrisdale. The easiest follows a gently rising track to the depression {{at the head}} of Bannerdale, while a variation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off and climb steeply up the terminal slope of The Tongue. Bullfell Beck can also be followed to give the most direct ascent to the summit, but the best route is perhaps to follow the east ridge over its undulating tops. From Bowscale, a little along the road to the north, the Victorian pony route to Bowscale Tarn can still be followed, continuing up a grassy rake that bisects Tarn Crag.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{ploughing}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds {{and the remains of}} previous crops and allowing them to break down. As the plough is drawn through the soil it creates long trenches of fertile soil called furrows. In modern use, a ploughed field is typically left to dry out, and is then harrowed before planting. Ploughing and cultivating a soil homogenises and modifies the upper 12 to 25cm of the soil to form a plough layer. In many soils, the majority of fine plant feeder roots {{can be found in the}} topsoil or plough layer.|$|E

25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E
25|$|The Greening of Harlem Coalition {{is another}} example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is {{responsible}} for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities {{to be in touch with}} nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.|$|E
25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away from Adam and look at and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam {{that it would be}} good for them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} of mathematicians {{on this matter}} are varied. Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{a blind eye to}} the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.|$|E
