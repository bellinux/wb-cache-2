25|$|Given {{conflicting}} {{evidence of the}} costs and benefits of smoking, controversy remains on what the clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental <b>health</b> <b>providers</b> have overlooked smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from significant stress and disability and as such should be allowed to engage in smoking as an activity that is pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental <b>health</b> <b>providers,</b> particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage medication compliance. However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E

The intervention consisted of a policy for implementation of minimal contact intervention, changes to documentation, a <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> mentor trained, a training session for <b>health</b> care <b>providers,</b> and ongoing paper and people supports for implementation. Data for this study were collected through a <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> questionnaire, focus group interviews, and a compliance protocol including a chart audit. The findings of this study showed a high degree of adherence to the policy, that <b>health</b> care <b>providers</b> thought minimal contact intervention was important to conduct with their clients, and that <b>health</b> care <b>providers</b> felt supported to implement the intervention. No statistically significant difference was found between new and experienced <b>health</b> care <b>providers</b> on 17 of the 18 questions on the <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> questionnaire.

The role of government in the economy was considerably decreased. On the other hand, some governmental economic functions were increased: a national health insurance system was introduced, though private <b>health</b> <b>providers</b> continued to provide health services within the national system. Social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefits, child allowances, old age pensions and minimum income support, were expanded continuously, until they formed a major budgetary expenditure.

25|$|Besides smoking cessation, the {{prevalence}} of smoking among people with schizophrenia also calls for additional measures in evaluation by mental <b>health</b> <b>providers.</b> Researchers argue that providers should incorporate tobacco use assessment into everyday clinical practice, as well as continuing assessments of cardiovascular health through measures such as blood pressure and diagnostics such as electrocardiography. Additionally there are ethical and practical concerns if healthcare facilities prohibit smoking without providing alternatives, particularly since withdrawal can alter the presentation of symptoms and response to treatment and may confuse or even exacerbate symptoms. Clinicians should also {{be aware of the}} consequences that can result from a lack of cigarettes, such as aggression, prostitution, trafficking, and general disruption. These consequences indicate that providers may need to help patients obtain cigarettes and/or monitor usage, although this may result in ethical concerns as well.|$|E

Methods: After the general framework of China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> selection was established, this study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics of China to commission a large-scale 2009 to 2010 national expert survey (n = 3, 914) through the organization of a pilot <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> research system for the first time in China, and the analytic network process (ANP) implementation methodology was adopted to analyze the dataset from this survey. Results: The market-oriented <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> selection from the doctors’ point of view; the traditional government’s regulation-oriented <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> selection from the pharmacists’ point of view, the hospital administrators’ point of view, and the point of view of health officials in health administration departments; the public private partnership (PPP) approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> selection from the nurses’ point of view, the point of view of officials in medical insurance agencies, and the health care researchers’ point of view. Conclusions: The data collected through a pilot <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> research system in the 2009 to 2010 national expert survey could help the decision maker effectively promote various experts’ views into various optimal solutions to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> care <b>provider</b> selection...|$|R
25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental <b>health</b> <b>providers</b> to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E
500|$|Treatments of this pseudoscientific {{disorder}} {{are called}} [...] "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies {{are aimed at}} adopted or fostered children {{with a view to}} creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are [...] to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as [...] "RADs", [...] "Radkids" [...] or [...] "Radishes" [...] and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental <b>health</b> <b>providers</b> who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.|$|E
