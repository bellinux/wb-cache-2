5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
25|$|Abbas' {{north-east}} frontier was now {{safe for}} the time being and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> his attention to the Ottomans in the west. After defeating the Uzbeks, he moved his capital from Qazvin to Isfahan.|$|E
25|$|Back in Paris, he {{set about}} {{one of his most}} {{outrageous}} schemes—convincing his old dupe the Marquise d'Urfé that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> her into a young man through occult means. The plan did not yield Casanova the big payoff he had hoped for, and the Marquise d'Urfé finally lost faith in him.|$|E

25|$|Certainly Benaud {{received}} {{a little help}} from the roughened patches, but he could do what the off-spinners could not do: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the ball, mostly slowly, sometimes with more life. His control was admirable, and when Benaud gets a batsman in trouble he rarely if ever gives him a loose one. He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1928, Zhang's mother {{suddenly}} died after having been ill for only four days. In the autumn, his granduncle, who lived with their family, died, and his father died the following June. Overwhelmed with providing care and medicine and then managing funerals for his loved ones, Zhang was upset with the suffering and misery that life had brought him. He no longer had any family <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> to.|$|E
25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his wall clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E
60|$|And {{she beat}} him off, she beat him off. Where <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>turn,</b> like a swimmer {{in a dark}} sea, beaten off from his hold, whither <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>turn?</b> He wanted to leave her, {{he wanted to be}} able to leave her. For his soul's sake, for his manhood's sake, he must be able to leave her.|$|R
50|$|Two {{months before}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>turned</b> 56, Ennis choked {{to death on}} a bone while eating dinner at a {{restaurant}} in Beverly Hills in 1963. He was survived by his ex-wife, Carmene, and a son, Christopher.|$|R
5000|$|Kidd {{described}} himself as a [...] "scatterbrained" [...] child, but he had a quick talent for drawing and was able to capture nearly anything he saw accurately with paper and pencil. However, when he recognized that cameras were able to create realistic images quicker and more accurately than <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to drawing the creations of his mind. Kidd particularly credits Chesley Bonestell and Norman Rockwell as his most formative influences.|$|R
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1237, the Tatar troops led by Batu Khan devastated Ryazan; by 1240, almost the lands of Chernigov, Pereyaslavl, Ryazan, and Suzdalia lay in ruins. During {{the first half of}} 1240, Mikhail Vsevolodovich defied Batu Khan by putting his envoys, who were seeking to coax him into submitting, to death. The only allies to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> for aid were the Hungarians and the Poles, and {{therefore}} he fled to Hungary. He attempted to arrange a marriage for Rostislav with the king’s daughter, but Béla IV saw no advantage to forming an alliance and evicted the two princes from Hungary.|$|E
25|$|After the Machines last {{match was}} shown on November 23, the angle was ended and André was {{announced}} as being reinstated on November 29. In the following weeks {{the mystery of}} why André the Giant was reinstated built up until {{it was revealed that}} Bobby Heenan had arranged for the suspension to end so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> on Hulk Hogan in the buildup to WrestleMania III. After the angle ended Eadie (Super Machine) was repackaged as Ax, one half of Demolition while Big Machine worked for the WWF as Blackjack Mulligan (Windham's best-known wrestling identity) in late 1986 and the first half of 1987 before leaving the promotion.|$|E
25|$|In the fall, Polly's husband Dick {{moved back}} home. His parents {{supplied}} a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, {{and the two}} children moved into a three-story tenement building. Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother's garden to Polly's apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seize him!" [...] a voice {{cried in}} German, and before <b>he</b> and Paolo <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> their horses {{half a dozen}} troopers were upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I help pushing ye {{when the}} folk behind push me?" [...] said Coggan, in a deprecating tone, {{turning his head}} towards the {{aforesaid}} folk as far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> without <b>turning</b> his body, which was jammed as in a vice.|$|R
60|$|To be sure <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> by <b>turning</b> the handle; {{and to be}} {{sure when}} he did turn it the same voice came rushing out, crying 'Why don't you come in? Come in, do you hear? What are you {{standing}} there for?'--quite violently.|$|R
25|$|It {{became evident}} that the new fighters could make long, steep dives and that the fixed, {{synchronised}} machine gun was aimed by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents. The Fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry, usually out of the sun, firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot could climb again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the Immelmann turn, a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical, to face the opposite way, after which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> to attack again.|$|E
25|$|Clint Barton {{was born}} in Waverly, Iowa. At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage, Clint and his brother Barney ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders. Clint soon {{caught the eye of}} the Swordsman, who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of Trick Shot, the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master archer. Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, {{allowing}} the Swordsman to escape town. Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.|$|E
25|$|Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he {{believed}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped {{and he had the}} help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was {{in the center of the}} line and too far away to support Sheridan but he could move the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought he could go through the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E. Pickett was about to change the situation and options of the Union commanders.|$|E

60|$|When he came {{to himself}} he felt so weak that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>turn</b> nor raise his head, but lay {{wondering}} vaguely where he was. As he looked upwards {{he thought he was}} still dreaming, for the well-known face of Pita was looking down upon him.|$|R
500|$|Amundsen chose three naval lieutenants as his expedition's officers: Thorvald Nilsen, a {{navigator}} {{who would}} be second-in-command; Hjalmar Fredrik Gjertsen, and Kristian Prestrud. Gjertsen, despite lacking a medical background, was made expedition doctor, and was sent on a [...] "lightning course" [...] in surgery and dentistry. A naval gunner, Oscar Wisting, was accepted on Prestrud's recommendation because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> his hand to most tasks. Although he had little previous experience of sledge dogs, Amundsen wrote that Wisting developed [...] "a way of his own" [...] with them, and became a useful amateur veterinarian.|$|E
500|$|This {{activity}} {{caused a}} public reassessment of Tillman, who {{was best known}} for giving speeches that shocked the North and made even southerners cringe. Writers suggested he was merely presenting an image as [...] "Pitchfork Ben", that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> on and off as needed. He came to be regarded in the North as acceptable and even respectable, with some suggesting he had matured during {{his time in the}} Senate. The Saturday Evening Post compared Tillman with a coconut, hard, rough, and shaggy on the outside, but within, [...] "the milk of human kindness".|$|E
500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They {{told me that if}} I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E
60|$|Instantly, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do anything, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>turn,</b> Richard {{was torn}} from her, {{struggling}} furiously, and {{thrown to the}} ground. Rachel sprang {{to the wall and}} stood with her back to it, raising the spear she held. It flashed into her mind that these were Zulus, and of Zulus she was not afraid.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1999 - 00 season, Billy {{was torn}} between {{renewing}} his contract with Harchester or taking an offer from West Ham United. He had originally planned on staying with Harchester, but West Ham offered a better contract, which O'Neil decided <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>turn</b> down.|$|R
50|$|Weiss {{was known}} for the {{conciseness}} of his writing. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>turned</b> {{each of the last}} ten chapters of The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity into its own book. His wife Eve, an English teacher, ensured the correctness of his English grammar and flow.|$|R
500|$|Commenting on the {{interruption}} of Crawford's career by his dispute with Surrey, Neville Cardus wrote: [...] "His break with Surrey must {{be regarded as}} a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself, and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket. It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains." [...] The Times commented: [...] "It {{was one of the great}} disappointments of English cricket in the first quarter of this century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized." [...] Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's [...] "capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'". He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life [...] "in comparative sporting obscurity". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some unseen or unheard-of {{elements}} of the story were fleshed out {{in the course of}} the novel. Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine, in which Palpatine explicitly says that Darth Plagueis was his master; in the film, it is merely hinted at. Additionally, it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakin's outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the holocrons in the Temple Archives, which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padmé's death. Not only is Saesee Tiin revealed to be a telepath, but his horn, lost in the Clone Wars, is revealed to have grown back. The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi-Wan to fight General Grievous, because he knew he needed to get Obi-Wan off Coruscant before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> Anakin to the dark side. The novel also reveals Mace Windu's rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine: he can sense Anakin's fear and distress, and does not believe the young Jedi is in any mental state to fight a Sith Lord. These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters' feelings and inner narrative. There are even some humorous lines added in, including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan - Grievous says, [...] "I was trained by Count Dooku," [...] and Obi-Wan replies, [...] "What a coincidence; I trained the man who killed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged, Langford senior," [...] replied Fred, {{making himself}} {{as tall as}} <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>turning</b> round to Carey with a very {{different}} tone, [...] "Now, Carey, we won't stop you any longer, if you'll only just be so good as to tell your man {{to get out the}} gig." ...|$|R
