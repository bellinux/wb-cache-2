40|$|Background: Psychosocial problems, such as behavioural, emotional, and {{educational}} problems, are highly prevalent among children and adolescents. Early treatment may reduce these problems, if accurately identified. Validated questionnaires may support identification. The {{aim of this}} study is to assess the psychometric qualities of such a questionnaire, the Short <b>Indicative</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> for Psychosocial problems among Adolescents (KIVPA,) and to determine whether it is suitable for and adds to the early detection of psychosocial problems among adolescents. Methods: Data came from a national sample of 1, 440 Dutch adolescents, using the KIVPA, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Of these, 1, 248 provided data on all questionnaires (77. 8 %). The scale structure of the KIVPA was assessed; its sensitivity and specificity using CBCL, YSR and referral for psychosocial problems as criteria; and its contribution to detecting CBCL and YSR problems. Results: The KIVPA is mostly uni-dimensional but the variance explained by its main factor is relatively low. The total KIVPA score discriminates between adolescents with and without problems on the three criteria. Using a clinical YSR total problem score as criterion, sensitivity and specificity are 0. 82 and 0. 85, respectively, at the proposed cut-off (area under the ROC curve: 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 90 - 0. 95). The odds ratio of a clinical YSR score for an elevated KIVPA score is 29. 1 (95 % CI: 14. 4 - 59. 1), although the KIVPA mainly covers internalizing problems. Conclusion: The KIVPA has added value in the early detection of internalizing psychosocial problems, but is not sufficiently efficient...|$|E
30|$|This study {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} limitations; the principle ones being the selective cohorts utilised and the small sample sizes included. The response rate of 22 and 32 Â % from both cohorts while low is in line with other studies and potentially <b>indicative</b> of <b>questionnaire</b> surveys [42], especially those investigating knowledge levels. This study included lead experts in Radiology and expert CT radiographers, so is not fully representative of either professions, and may render the sample over-representative in nature. Further work is encouraged to gauge the understanding amongst cross-sections of both professions using larger sample sizes. It could be argued that selection bias may also be inherent within this questionnaire as respondents who are more confident of their answers are more likely to participate. Finally, although all participants were asked not to refer to other information sources, such as textbooks, internet, etc., while completing the questionnaires this could not be guaranteed given the nature of the survey.|$|R
