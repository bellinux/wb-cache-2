40|$|History of {{underwater}} diving {{dates back}} to antiquity. Breath-hold technique in diving was known to the ancient nations. However, deep diving progressed only {{in the early decades}} of the 19 th century as the result of advancements in efficient underwater technologies which subsequently led to invention of sophisticated sets of scuba diving in the 20 th century. Currently, diving is performed for various purposes including commercial, recreational, military, underwater construction, oil industry, underwater archeology and scientific assessment of marine life. By increasing popularity of underwater diving, dive-related medical conditions gradually became more evident and created a new challenge for the health care professionals, so that eventually, a specialty the so-called “diving medicine” was established. Most of the diving-associated disorders appear in the head and neck. The most common of all occupational disorders associated with diving are otologic diseases. External otitis has been reported as the most common otolaryngologic problem in underwater divers. Exostosis of the external ear canal may be formed in divers as the result of prolonged diving in cold waters. Other <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and paranasal sinuses in underwater divers are caused by barometric pressure change (i. e., barotraumas), and to a lesser extent by decompression sickness. Barotrauma of the middle ear is the most prevalent barotrauma in divers. The inner ear barotraumas, though important, is less common. The present paper is a brief overview of diving-related ear disorders particularly in scuba divers...|$|E
40|$|Restoration {{of hearing}} is {{associated}} {{in many cases}} with resocialisation of those affected and therefore occupies an important place {{in a society where}} communication is becoming ever faster. Not all problems can be solved surgically. Even 50 years after the introduction of tympanoplasty, the hearing results are unsatisfactory and often do not reach the threshold for social hearing. The cause of this can in most cases be regarded as incomplete restoration of the mucosal function of the middle ear and tube, which leads to ventilation <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and does not allow real vibration of the reconstructed middle ear. However, a few are also caused by the biomechanics of the reconstructed ossicular chain. There has been progress in reconstructive middle ear surgery, which applies particularly to the development of implants. Implants made of titanium, which are distinguished by outstanding biocompatibility, delicate design and by biomechanical possibilities in the reconstruction of chain function, can be regarded as a new generation. Metal implants for the first time allow a controlled close fit with the remainder of the chain and integration of micromechanical functions in the implant. Moreover, there has also been progress in microsurgery itself. This applies particularly to the operative procedures for auditory canal atresia, the restoration of the tympanic membrane and the coupling of implants. This paper gives a summary of the current state of reconstructive microsurgery paying attention to the acousto-mechanical rules...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{otitis media}} (COM), a {{persistent}} and durable inflammation and infection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>ear,</b> {{is a common}} disorder. Alterations in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>ear</b> in sufferers have been observed in recent years. Because only {{a few studies have}} been reported in this area, we performed this study in order to assess alterations in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>ear</b> <b>of</b> patients with COM.   Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional and descriptive methods were used in 100 patients with COM who were selected for surgical treatment and admitted to hospital. An information form was completed for all patients including demographic data, medical history of otoscopy and paraclinical examinations such as pure tone audiometry (PTA), tympanometry, Schuller radiography, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). All data were processed using SPSS (version 18) software and descriptive statistical tests.   Results: According to otoscopy, PTA, tympanometry and graphical analysis, 60 % <b>of</b> patients experienced <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contralateral <b>ear.</b> Otoscopy analysis showed 54 % of patients had a <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contralateral <b>ear,</b> with <b>the</b> most common <b>disorder</b> being perforation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum. PTA showed a 48 % incidence of contralateral ear problems (85 % conductive hearing impairment; 12. 5 % sensorineural hearing impairment; 1. 2 % mixed). A total of 73. 2 % of patients with conductive hearing loss had a problem across all frequencies, while half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients with sensorineural hearing impairment had problems at frequencies greater than 1000 Hz. According to tympanometry, 38 % of patients had problem in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>ear.</b> HRCT and Schuller graphical analyses indicated 31. 5 % and 36 % occurrence <b>of</b> contralateral ear <b>disorders,</b> respectively.   Conclusion:  More than 50 % of patients with COM in one ear have a chance of also presenting with the disease in <b>the</b> other <b>ear.</b> Outcomes <b>of</b> this study and previous studies have shown that COM should not be perceived as a disease limited to one ear, because in most cases <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease can affect both ears. ...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} factor in diagnosing a patient with vertiginous epilepsy is the subject’s detailed description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode.

[...] In addition to <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, neurological, physical and hematologic examinations are completed to assist in diagnosis.

40|$|AbstractProfound {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (PSHL) is not uncommonly {{encountered}} in otology. In clinics, {{there is a high}} incidence of otolithic damage in patients with PSHL, but relevant reports are few. Sharing a continuous membranous structure and similar receptor cell ultrastructures, the cochlea and vestibule may be susceptible to the same harmful factors. <b>Disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ear</b> may result in a variety of manifestations, including vertigo, spatial disorientation, blurred vision, impaired articulation, and hearing impairment. Considering <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> clinical symptoms associated with PSHL with otolithic dysfunction, it may be frequently misdiagnosed, and objective means <b>of</b> testing <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> otolithic organs should be recommended for hearing-impaired patients.

40|$|Autoimmune {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (ASNHL) is {{characterized}} typically by bilateral, rapidly progressive hearing loss that responds therapeutically to corticosteroid treatment. Despite its name, data implicating autoimmunity in <b>the</b> etiopathogenesis <b>of</b> ASNHL have been limited, and targeted self-antigens have not been identified. In the current study we show that the inner ear–specific proteins cochlin and β-tectorin are capable of targeting experimental autoimmune hearing loss (EAHL) in mice. Five weeks after immunization of SWXJ mice with either Coch 131 – 150 or β-tectorin 71 – 90, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) showed significant hearing loss at all frequencies tested. Flow cytometry analysis showed that each peptide selectively activated CD 4 + T cells with a proinflammatory Th 1 -like phenotype. T cell mediation of EAHL was determined by showing significantly increased ABR thresholds 6 weeks after adoptive transfer of peptide-activated CD 4 + T cells into naive SWXJ recipients. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that leukocytic infiltration of inner ear tissues coincided with onset of hearing loss. Our study provides a contemporary mouse model for clarifying our understanding of ASNHL and facilitating <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> novel effective treatments for this clinical entity.
