5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

That evening he declared at a mass meeting, [...] "I have been inspired and moved by today. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it." [...] Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, [...] "Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school." [...] The D Day campaign received front page coverage by The Washington Post and The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|The Parisian critic Arnold Mortier, {{in a long}} {{review of}} the play, {{described}} it as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "elegant", and highly praised Dailly's performance as Valdemar, but believed the staging lacked originality: [...] "a {{great deal of money}} went into this production, but very few ideas." [...] Like Sarcey, he commented with some asperity on the metaphorical use of Volsius and Ox as symbols of Good and Evil, rather than attractive young women playing Good and Bad Fairies: [...] "Is it not time, perhaps, to return to that practice?" [...] An anonymous reviewer for The New York Times said of the play: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> more idiotically incoherent, or of which the dialogue is more pretentious," [...] but predicted {{that it would be a}} success because of its spectacular production values. Henri de Bornier gave the play a brief but highly positive notice in La Nouvelle revue, highlighting the elegance of the decor and commenting Verne and d'Ennery had done humankind a [...] "true service" [...] by exploring impossible domains on the stage.|$|E

500|$|The 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships {{were held}} in August at Sydney Olympic Park, and were viewed as a {{rehearsal}} for the 2000 Summer Olympics {{to be held in}} the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time. The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and South Africa's Ryk Neethling in the 400m freestyle final. The trio reached the 200m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86s ahead of world-record pace at 300m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350m mark and finished in a time of 3min 41.83s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record, and covering the second half in almost {{the same time as the}} first. Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as [...] "the greatest swimmer we've [...] ever had", whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, commentating for NBC, said [...] "...he went into a balls-out sprint at 250– and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it's the most amazing swim I've ever seen, hands down." [...] A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records. Thorpe promptly donated the A$25,000 prizemoney for breaking the first world record in the pool to charity. Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4×100m freestyle final, the first time the United States had lost the event. Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1s faster than his individual best of 49.98s. It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times. The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200m freestyle, Thorpe broke Hackett's world record by 0.33s, clocking 1min 46.34s. The next day in the final, he again broke the record, lowering it to 1min 46.0s. He finished his competition by leading off the 4×200m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and Bill Kirby to victory. Their time lowered their own world record by more than three seconds, completing Thorpe's fourth world record in four nights.|$|E

[...] In order to indicate, finally, that the city was even then under the Ottoman rule, the narrator adds that the people of Damascus had just received a governor ("na'ib") from Constantinople.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April, Bale {{scored the}} winning goal for Real Madrid with five minutes {{remaining}} in the 2014 Copa del Rey Final against rivals Barcelona. Considered {{one of the best}} goals of his career, Bale outsprinted Barcelona defender Marc Bartra from the halfway line (with Bale running off the field at one point) before converting past goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto. In the post match interview Bale stated, [...] "I had to get round the player and go off the pitch to do it", while his Real Madrid teammate Xabi Alonso commented, [...] "It was incredible, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it". The goal was Bale's 20th of the season and his first in a Clásico fixture.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Ten Year War, Michigan's {{regular season}} {{performance}} declined, but their post season performance improved. The 1979 season included a memorable game against Indiana that ended with a touchdown pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter with six seconds left in the game. The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's emotional radio narration: [...] "Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like this in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] I hope you can hear me – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years!

2500|$|In Michigan's eighth {{game against}} an unranked Indiana team, Wangler had his most replayed {{moment in a}} Michigan uniform.

[...] Wangler dropped back to pass from his own 45-yard line, and his pass hit Anthony Carter at the 23-yard line.
