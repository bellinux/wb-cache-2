5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E

5|$|Tom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames {{complaints}} about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> before subwoofers {{made it possible}} to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.|$|E

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> {{the effect of the}} laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

Back at her house, Destiny greets her friend Nakeisha Johnson, who tells her Renz was left out of the camp {{yearbook}} and there are no photos of him.

5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E

6000|$|Having done so I ask the {{attention}} of this audience to the question whether I have succeeded in sustaining the charge, and whether Judge Douglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it?

5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|The author credits {{multiple}} sources for introducing {{doubts about his}} conditions while living at Gold Base. He writes that he listened to The John and Ken Show on KFI, and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him to think more critically during his time at the compound. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> viewing Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence.|$|E

When Sasha asks who would teach her, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he might.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E

5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
