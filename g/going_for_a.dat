5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dig. He heard a strange sound.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Merckx {{looked to}} be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, {{becoming}} the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so. In 1980, Hinault was <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race {{as well as the}} one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.|$|E

Santosh gets spotted along with Hasini by Subramaniam and now he reveals his love affair. Subramaniam is furious upon hearing this as Santosh is already engaged to Rajeshwari. Subramaniam asks Santosh to bring Hasini to his home and make her stay with them for a week so that he will make Santosh understand that Rajeshwari is the better bride for him.

In the first bout of the evening, Dan Cramer {{became the first}} fighter {{to be successful in}} a professional mixed martial arts debut at a UFC pay-per-view event since Marcio Cruz at UFC 55. In his fight with Matt Arroyo, Cramer executed a takedown and attempted punches on the ground while avoiding the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown-belt's submissions during the first two rounds, while the third and final round saw Arroyo taking Cramer's back on the ground and unsuccessfully <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rear naked choke. Two of the three judges scored the bout 29–28 for Cramer while the remaining third judge saw it 28–29 for Arroyo, giving Cramer the split-decision victory.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} in the county matches. As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests, he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches, and the three spinners Ring, Johnson and McCool did more of the work, especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests. Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided to bat for an extended period instead of <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E

5|$|A {{battle for}} the lead {{developed}} between Hamilton and Ricciardo, until the Australian moved around Hamilton on lap 15. With {{the grip of the}} intermediate tyres deteriorating, there were many overtaking manoeuvres on track. Rosberg unsuccessfully tried to overtake teammate Hamilton for second on lap 16, while Verstappen took sixth place from Vettel one lap later, only to run wide and lose the position again. On lap 18, Rosberg moved ahead of Hamilton, who {{was the first of the}} front runners to change tyres at the end of the lap, <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dry compound. The other frontrunners followed suit over the next couple of laps. Following the pit stops, Ricciardo led from Rosberg, Kvyat and Hamilton. The two Mercedes drivers moved ahead of their respective Red Bull rivals on laps 22 and 23, while Vettel, now in fifth, closed on the leading quartet. On lap 24, he reached Kvyat and overtook him for fourth, while Nico Rosberg extended his lead to Ricciardo to nine seconds by lap 25. Hamilton took second place from Ricciardo one lap later. At the same time, Kimi Räikkönen was forced to retire. So had Massa on lap 24, suffering the same problem that had forced his teammate to stop.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

25|$|After the {{fireworks}} of the First Test the MCC team drove to Toowoomba with their reputation much enhanced by their performance and were welcomed as heroes. Rugby League was strong in Queensland's largest inland {{town and the}} genial John Bapty, who covered both rugby and cricket in the Yorkshire Evening Post, gave a speech of thanks after a dinner was given for the Lancastrians and Yorkshiremen in the team. The MCC belted 428/6 off 54.5 overs against light-hearted bowling with David Sheppard (72), Reg Simpson (98), Gilbert Parkhouse (57), acting captain Denis Compton (92) and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (94) helping themselves, but Brian Close <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> duck. Compton declared {{in the afternoon and}} the Queensland Country XI were 88/3 by stumps and 220 all out the next day with captain Tom Allen hitting 2 sixes and 10 fours in his top-scoring 83 as Doug Wright (5/52) and Eric Hollies (3/33) served up old-fashioned leg-spin. Rather that enforce the follow on and <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> win Compton good-naturedly put on another batting display and the MCC hit 297/7 off the remaining 37 overs of the day. Sheppard made 42, Parkhouse 58 and even the stonewaller Trevor Bailey gave the bowling the long handle with 68 not out, but Close bagged a pair.|$|E

25|$|The {{incomplete}} 2001 Six Nations Championship {{was concluded}} in October, with England playing Ireland. England lost 20–14 at Lansdowne Road. Both Ireland and England had won {{four out of}} the five Six Nations fixtures, but England's superior points difference ensured they clinched the title although, {{for the second year}} running, not the Grand Slam. In a match against Australia for the Cook Cup in November, Wilkinson scored all of England's points in their 21–15 victory at Twickenham. After being rested as an unused bench replacement in the subsequent match against Romania, he then played a large role in a win over the Springboks, in which he kicked seven penalty goals in the 29–9 victory. <b>Going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third Six Nations title in a row, England got {{off to a good start}} in their 2002 Six Nations Championship with wins over Scotland and Ireland, before losing to France at the Stade de France. England won their remaining fixtures against Wales and Italy but France went on to complete a Grand Slam. The Falcons were in Pool6 in the 2001–02 Heineken Cup, and won one match, finishing fourth in the pool.|$|E

25|$|In Game 3, Atlanta showed its athleticism with {{an array}} of dunks from Josh Smith (26 points) and a strong {{interior}} performance by the rookie Al Horford (17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists), who also jawed with Paul Pierce {{near the end of the}} game. There would be more jawing in Game 4 between Zaza Pachulia and Kevin Garnett, but the outcome was a surprise: thanks to fourth quarter heroics by Joe Johnson and Smith, who combined to score 32 of Atlanta's 34 4th quarter points, the upstart Hawks rallied from a 10-point third quarter deficit in Game 4 to tie the series going back to Boston. Boston dominated Game 5, but in Game 6, six Hawks players finished in double figures to force a winner-take-all Game 7. The Hawks were no match for the Celtics in Game 7, as the Celtics held them to 26 points in the 1st half. 3 minutes into the 2nd half, the series' tensions finally boiled over when Marvin Williams was ejected for committing a hard foul on Rajon Rondo.

25|$|Bollinger {{was signed}} up by Chennai Super Kings for the 2010 Indian Premier League. He has been {{included}} in the roster after the Super Kings' all-rounder Jacob Oram confirmed his unavailability for the season due to injury. Bollinger arrived for {{the second half of the}} tournament after the end of the tour of New Zealand. Bollinger is the fourth Australian to play for the Super Kings after Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and George Bailey. In his IPL debut, he helped Chennai defend a total of 246 against Rajasthan by taking a catch off Yusuf Pathan which was <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> six; he backpedalled and caught the ball and had to throw it up in the air before falling over the rope and then rebalancing himself to complete the catch. This earned him an award for the best catch of the match. He delivered a spell of 2/15 from four overs dismissing Shane Watson who got 60 off just 25 balls in a match which the other Chennai bowlers averaged 13 runs per over in contrast to his 3.75. Rajasthan ended their innings at 223.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller {{came to the}} crease {{on the first day}} with the score at 3/128 after Australia won the toss and elected to bat, facing wet {{conditions}} after the loss of Arthur Morris and Harvey in quick succession. He scored 55 in a partnership of 109 for the fourth wicket with Hassett. Both players batted patiently, scoring at around two runs per over. Miller was then dismissed by Johnny Wardle while <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> big hit to leave the score at 4/237 early on the second morning. It was a subdued innings from the all-rounder, who had hit only three fours in 184 balls faced. His dismissal triggered a sharp collapse as all the incoming batsmen were unable to pass four and Australia lost a total of 7/12 (including 6/5) to be all out for 249. Miller then looked on as England were bowled out for 144. He scored five in the second innings, caught off a deliberate full toss by Bedser, as Australia collapsed and lost 7/59 to be dismissed for 123, leaving England a victory target of 229. The hosts reached 1/120 before the match ended in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
