5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
500|$|Electric {{stimulation}} {{treatment was}} used to treat nervous disorders where the nervous system was unable to stimulate a required <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> or muscle activity. [...] It had previously been successfully used to treat some forms of asthma. [...] Bird used his apparatus to treat Sydenham's chorea (St Vitus's dance) {{and other forms of}} spasm, some forms of paralysis (although the treatment was of no use where nerves had been physically damaged), opiate overdose (since it kept the patient awake), bringing on menstruation where this had failed (amenorrhoea), and hysteria, a supposed disease of women. [...] Paralysed bladder function in young girls was attributed to the now archaic condition of hysteria. [...] It was treated with the application of a strong electric current between the sacrum and the pubis.

50|$|Males {{perform the}} task of inseminating queens. They perch in areas where young queens might pass, {{awaiting}} mating opportunities. They scent mark their perches using a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> containing tetradecyl acetate and butyric acid. This is likely a signal to other males rather than to females. Males of this species also help to incubate pupae, a task done only by workers in most bee species.|$|E

50|$|When alarmed, {{adults can}} emit an {{extremely}} foul smelling <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> through a sternal membrane, ejected up to 1 m. Nymphs {{do not have}} this ability, and the secretion is built up over approximately 60 days from its final molt into adulthood. Males that were artificially drained required 30 days to replenish the stored amount. The secretion is composed primarily of (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenol and (E)-2-hexenoic acid.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Description== This shrub reaches between 1 and 2 {{meters in}} height. It is {{low to the}} ground with some of the lower {{branches}} rooting in the soil and others extending more outward than upward. The stems are twisting and reddish-brown in color, and shiny due to <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion.</b> The petioles may sometimes have clear-to-glandular hairs. The leaves are oval-shaped to nearly round, and flat, shiny, and smooth. They are 6 centimeters long and four wide at maximum.|$|E
50|$|Parischnogaster striatula is {{a species}} of social hover wasps found in Southeast Asia. Their nests are uniquely shaped, mimic their {{surroundings}} and, like the other Stenogastrinae social wasps, lack a nest pedicel. They are also unique {{in their use of}} <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> when laying eggs. P. striatula is also different than typical wasps because the queens {{are not the only ones}} who possess reproductive capabilities; other females also have developed ovaries. This wasp is also known for fiercely protecting its nest against enemies, such as ants or other hornets.|$|E

50|$|Arnica longifolia is a rhizomatous plant forming large {{bunching}} {{patches of}} groundcover in moist, cool areas. The foliage is rough, mint-green, and sometimes sticky with <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions.</b> The stems are erect and bear daisylike flower heads with deep yellow ray florets and yellow to reddish or orange disc florets. The fruit is a reddish achene {{with a small}} pappus.|$|R
50|$|Like {{almost all}} Platyhelminthes the Dolichomacrostomidae are {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodites. They are remarkable {{for the high}} complexity of their genitalia. The male copulatory organ often consists of two parts, a glandular and a penis stylet. The former only transfers <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions</b> and the latter both sperm and glandular products. The female genitalia are often associated with sclerotized valve structures of unknown function.|$|R
50|$|The larvae of Lomechusa pubicollis live inside {{colonies of}} the European red wood ant Formica polyctena, or the red wood ant Formica rufa. Each larva {{produces}} a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> which persuades worker ants to groom it. The beetle larva rears up {{in a manner}} that imitates the begging behaviour of an ant larva, touching the worker ant on its mouthparts, which stimulates it to regurgitate a drop of liquid food. The beetle larva also feeds on ant larvae as well as smaller larvae of its own species. When fully developed, the beetle larva pupates in the ant colony.|$|E
50|$|Adult Lebia grandis ground beetles overwinter in soil {{in or near}} potato fields. In {{the spring}} Colorado potato beetles emerge from hibernation. By the time Lebia grandis beetles emerge a few weeks later, there are eggs and young larvae of their prey for them to eat and {{suitable}} pupae will soon be available for their larvae to attack. An adult beetle can eat about twenty three eggs or three third instar larvae of the Colorado potato beetle each day. After mating, the females lay eggs singly in the soil near potato plants. A <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> causes soil granules {{to stick to the}} eggs which serves to camouflage them. Each female can lay up to 1300 eggs {{over the course of a}} few months.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are active}} {{from the late}} summer, {{sometimes}} as early as July, with the males emerging first and {{stay close to the}} emergence site where they scout for females to mate with. When a female emerges, the males swarm towards her and attempt to mate; they may form a [...] "mating ball" [...] with many males surrounding a single female. Once mated, the females begin to excavate their burrows, lining the walls of the burrows with a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> which hardens and acts as an anti-fungal defence. Each cell is provisioned with pollen and nectar, mainly collected from the flowers of the sea aster, and the bee's flight period is timed to coincide with the flowering period of sea aster.|$|E
50|$|Like other cockroaches, T. petiveriana uses {{chemical}} pheromones {{to communicate}} with each other. When disturbed, they are said to raise their wings and evert lateral glands on the second and third abdominal segments. Their <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions</b> were found to contain volatile compounds N-3-methylbutylacetamide (MBA) and N-3-methylbutylpropanamide (MBP), making up nearly 60% of the volatile fraction. These chemicals appeared to induce alarm behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Pityrodia byrnesii is a shrub which {{grows to}} {{a height of}} about 1 m and which has its {{branches}} densely covered with glands and hairs. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three along the branches and are 1.5-3 cm long, 4-10 mm wide. They are sticky due to <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions,</b> smooth on top with a distinct mid-rib on the lower surface.|$|R
25|$|Worker bees combine pollen, {{honey and}} <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions</b> and {{allow it to}} ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The {{fermentation}} process releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by nurse bees (younger workers) who then produce the protein-rich royal jelly needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.|$|R
50|$|Once {{they have}} found a new nest site, the A. pallens convey this {{information}} to other workers and intermediates through glandular secretions from their antennae. They make upward runs of several centimeters long on vertical surfaces providing a road map of sorts for the adult wasps to follow. The front body of the wasp will angle slightly upward while the antennae works its way upwardly to maintain the connection with the surface. The wings perk up as they make this connection. Typically the A.pallens begin to use this trail about 3 hours after the swarm formation. This means that generally the new site is already being developed. In fact the dragging behavior seen to deposit the <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> by the wasp is seen only after the deposition of building material at the new nest site.|$|E
5000|$|Under their pretarsi, {{members of}} the Diptera {{generally}} have paired lobes or pulvilli, meaning [...] "little cushions". There is a single pulvillus below each unguis. The pulvilli often have an arolium between them or otherwise a median bristle or empodium, meaning the meeting place of the pulvilli. On {{the underside of the}} tarsal segments there frequently are pulvillus-like organs or plantulae. The arolium, plantulae and pulvilli are adhesive organs enabling their possessors to climb smooth or steep surfaces. They all are outgrowths of the exoskeleton and their cavities contain blood. Their structures are covered with tubular tenent hairs, the apices of which are moistened by a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion.</b> The organs are adapted to apply the hairs closely to a smooth surface so that adhesion occurs through surface molecular forces.|$|E

30|$|As {{the name}} suggests, {{the cause of}} {{idiopathic}} granulomatous mastitis is unknown. This condition {{is more common in}} pregnant and lactating women and in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and may be related to increased ductal secretions. These increased ductal secretions may lead to damaged ductal epithelium with <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions</b> leaking into the connective tissue of the breast stroma. This process results in a chemical mastitis [21].|$|R
30|$|The precise {{etiology}} of IGM is uncertain. Current theories of IGM etiology favor an inflammatory response within the connective tissue of breast stroma to <b>glandular</b> <b>secretions</b> leaked from damaged ductal epithelium [2]. Inflammation is localized within lobules and {{may result in}} a chemical mastitis. Potential precipitating factors include autoimmune disease, pregnancy and lactation, hyperprolactinemia, oral contraceptive use, trauma, and foreign body reaction, among others.|$|R

50|$|S. mansoni is {{locomotive}} in primarily {{two stages}} of its life cycle: as cercariae swimming freely through a body of freshwater to locate the epidermis of their human hosts, and as developing and fully-fledged adults, migrating throughout their primary host upon infection. Cercariae are attracted {{to the presence of}} fatty acids on the skin of their definitive host, and the parasite responds to changes in light and temperature in their freshwater medium to navigate towards the skin. Ressurreicao et al. (2015) tested the roles of various protein kinases in the ability of the parasite to navigate its medium and locate a penetrable host surface. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and protein kinase C both respond to changes in medium temperature and light levels, and the stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, associated with recognition of parasite host surface, results in a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> that deteriorates the host epidermis, and allows the parasite to burrow into its host.|$|E
5000|$|The {{entrance}} and surrounding areas of their nest are {{coated with a}} smooth, thick layer of black, red, or yellow cerumen, a material formed by mixing beeswax (a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> of worker bees) with propolis. [...] They lack external entrance tunnels. T. carbonaria builds brood cells arranged in combs or semicombs. The cells are a single layer of hexagonal combs that are built in a spiral. They are vertically elongated and in a regular vertical orientation. They are built out of brown cerumen, and house the eggs and larvae. New cells {{are added to the}} brood by the advancing front. The nest cavity may be sealed off from adjoining cavities by a hard batumen layer of cerumen or field-collected material. The brood chamber is centered in the hive, which makes T. carbonaria suitable for hive propagation. The brood chamber is also made up of multiple horizontal layers which allow for easy division of the brood comb.|$|E
50|$|Novomessor cockerelli forms large {{underground}} colonies, {{sometimes with}} multiple entrances, on open ground or beside rocks. The nest {{tends to be}} surrounded by a midden, a circle of tiny pebbles and plant remains. The worker ants normally leave the nest to forage in the early morning and in the evening, at which times the ground temperature is within the range 20 to 40 C. During the winter they may forage throughout the day. Seeds and plant material are collected but nearly half of the diet consists of the corpses of insects. These ants scavenge around carcases for dead insects such as flies. When a prey item is found that is too large for a single ant to carry, other ants are recruited by the use of pheromones. The original ant liberates a <b>glandular</b> <b>secretion</b> which attracts other workers within about two metres (yards) of the release point. If this fails to summon enough assistance, it releases a further secretion on the ground and lays a trail back to the colony. Other ants are attracted to follow the trail and then work co-operatively to transport the food item back to the nest. The trail is short-lived and soon evaporates.|$|E

40|$|Many exocrine {{products}} used by ground beetles are pheromones and allomones {{that regulate}} intra- and interspecific interactions {{and contribute to}} their success in terrestrial ecosystems.
