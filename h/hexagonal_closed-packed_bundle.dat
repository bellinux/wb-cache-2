The method distinguishes between shuffle displacements and net shuffles. While shuffle displacements correspond to movements between ideal atom positions in the parent and twin lattices, net shuffles comprise contributions from shear on overlying planes which can operate along opposite directions to those of shuffle displacements. Thus, net shuffles in the twinning direction can vanish in a limiting case, as is interestingly the case for those needed in the second plane by the b_ 4 dislocation candidate in { 11 - 22 } twinning.

Using inelastic electron scattering, {{we were able to}} follow the spin wave dispersion up to the surface Brillouin zone boundary ((K) over bar), i. e., up to a wave-vector transfer of 1. 64 A(- 1). The spin wave dispersion was found to agree surprisingly well with the dispersion relation of a surface spin wave calculated by a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model. From this description, we obtain a value for the product of the exchange coupling constant (J) and the magnetic moment (S) of JS= 14. 8 +/- 1 meV. This value, within the error bar, is identical to our results obtained on thin fcc Co films on Cu(001). We also find that the spin wave features measured by SPEELS at high-wave-vectors are strongly broadened. This is in agreement with expectations from nonadiabatic theoretical descriptions in which the broadening is ascribed to a strong damping of these high-wave-vectors spin waves by Stoner excitations. Similar to the observations in previously studied systems, we also observe a strong dependence of the measured spin wave intensities on the kinetic energy of the incident electrons (E-kin).

The optical properties are also sensitive to the orientation of the tubes.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in understanding the structural phase transformations in Pu is to determine the energetically favored, continuous atomic pathways from one crystal symmetry to another. This problem involves enumerating candidate pathways and studying their energetics to garner insight into instabilities and energy barriers. The purpose of this work is to investigate the energetics of two transformation pathways for the delta to alpha' transformation in Pu that were recently proposed [Lookman et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 : 145504, 2008] on the basis of symmetry. These pathways require the presence of either an intermediate <b>hexagonal</b> <b>closed-packed</b> (hcp) structure or a simple hexagonal (sh) structure. A subgroup of the parent fcc and the intermediate hexagonal structure, which has trigonal symmetry, facilitates the transformation to the intermediate hcp or sh structure. Phonons then break the translational symmetry from the intermediate hcp or sh structure to the final monoclinic symmetry of the alpha' structure. We perform simulations using the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) for Pu to investigate these candidate pathways. Our main conclusion is that the path via hcp is energetically favored and the volume change for both pathways essentially occurs in the second step of the transformation, i. e. from the intermediate sh or hcp to the monoclinic structure. Our work also highlights the deficiency of the current state-of-the-art MEAM potential in capturing the anisotropy associated with the lower symmetry monoclinic structure.

The self-assembly of monodisperse micrometer scale colloidal spheres into <b>hexagonal</b> <b>closed-packed</b> colloidal crystals provides a simple, fast, and cheap materials chemistry approach to PCs. ^ Employing DNA supramolecular recognition, 2 -dimensional (2 D) photonic crystal monolayer was fabricated with monodisperse polystyrene colloidal microspheres. Amine-terminated DNA oligomers were covalently attached onto carboxy-decorated microspheres and enabled their DNA-functionalization while preserving their colloidal stability and organization properties. Following a capillary-force-assisted organization of DNA-decorated microspheres into close-packed 2 D opaline arrays, the first monolayer was immobilized by DNA hybridization. ^ Insertion of vacancies at predetermined sites within the lattice of colloidal crystals is a prerequisite in order to realize high-quality, opaline-based photonic devices. The previously obtained DNA-hybridization type binding of 2 D-opaline arrays provides a heat-sensitive 2 ̆ 2 adhesive 2 ̆ 2 between substrate and microspheres within a surrounding aqueous medium that enables tuning the hybridization strength of DNA linker {{as well as a}} mechanism to facilitate the removal of unbound microspheres. Focusing a laser beam onto a single microsphere of the opaline array induces localized heating that enables the microsphere to detach, leaving behind vacancies. By repeating this process, line vacancies were successfully obtained. The effects of salt concentration, laser power, light-absorbing dyes, DNA length and refractive index mismatch were investigated and found to correlate with heat-induced DNA dehybridization. ^ In addition, AC (alternating current) electrokinetic force was also utilized to obtain assembly of colloidal single crystal monolayer in microfluidic chamber.

Nevertheless, CoNi thin films with different thickness and structure (denoted as CoNi(n)) were synthesized in a fixed Co 2 +/Ni 2 + solution under cyclic voltammetric conditions by varying the cyclic numbers (n) within a defined potential range. AES and EDS analysis revealed that the atomic ratio of Co/Ni in the film (including both outer and inner layer) was in good accordance with the initial Co 2 +/Ni 2 + ratio.

In situ FOR reflection spectroscopic studies demonstrated that the mainly chemisorbed CO species (COad) on CoNi(x:y) surfaces were transferred from linearly bonded CO (COL) to bridge bonded CO (COB) {{as a function of}} the content of Ni and the crystal phase structure of CoNi thin films. CoNi(x:y) and CoNi(n) thin films all exhibited anomalous IR properties, corresponding respectively to abnormal IR effects (AIREs), Fano-like IR effects and surface-enhanced IR absorption effects. AIREs characterized mostly with inversion of IR band was found on CoNi(x:y), CoNi(4), CoNi(8) thin films which were dominated by irregular or imperfectly spherical particles. Fano-like IR bands with positive-going peak on the lower wavenumbers side were observed in cases of CO adsorbed on CoNi thin films composed mainly of multiform nanoparticles, typically on CoNi(25) thin film. IR features were finally changed into surface-enhanced IR absorption as CO adsorbed on the CoNi(50) thin film, i. e., the CoNi thin film was dominated by smooth irregular polyhedral particles.

40|$|An {{effective}} and reliable method {{was established to}} fabricate ordered arrays of conducting polypyrrole (PPy) with tunable morphologies. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp was used to lift up {{the top layer of}} silica spheres with a <b>closed-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> arrangement on a silicon wafer. The lattice spacing of the silica sphere array on the PDMS stamp could be tuned by controlling the swelling of the stamp. Afterwards, the silica spheres were transferred onto a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film which was pre-spin-coated on an ITO glass. The silica spheres were etched away with hydrofluoric (HF) acid, and the resulting porous PVA film maintained an identical ordered array but of holes. Electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole monomer was carried out with the ITO glass as a working electrode, on which was the PVA film with ordered holes. Different charge densities applied led to PPy patterns with different morphologies; a possible mechanism was addressed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Rare earth–cobalt (RCo, R=Sm, Pr) {{films with}} {{thicknesses}} from 30 to 700 nm {{have been prepared}} with and without a Cr underlayer by dc magnetron sputtering from a R 2 Co 7 composite target. The as-deposited SmCo films with a Cr underlayer (SmCo║Cr) have magnetic coercivities of about 500 – 2800 Oe and the PrCo║Cr films have coercivities of about 100 – 300 Oe, but after annealing at 500 °C coercivities as high as 31 kOe for SmCo║Cr films and 10 kOe for PrCo║Cr films were observed. The as-deposited PrCo films are composed mostly of an amorphous phase with about 30 vol % of crystallites but after annealing at 500 °C the film is transformed completely to crystallites of about 10 nm diameter as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Nanodiffraction and HRTEM {{studies show that the}} crystallites have a <b>closed-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> structure. HRTEM study also shows that the annealed SmCo films with a Cr underlayer have grain sizes of about 20 nm and the SmCo films without the Cr underlayer have grain sizes of about 10 nm. The large increase in coercivity for the annealed films is due to the growth of the crystallites...|$|R
