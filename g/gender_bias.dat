5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This <b>gender</b> <b>bias</b> is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce <b>gender</b> <b>bias</b> and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, {{and the creation of a}} two-sector system.|$|E
5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome <b>gender</b> <b>bias</b> by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

25|$|Feminist {{activism}} in India gained {{momentum in the}} late 1970s. One of the first national-level issues that brought women's groups together was the Mathura rape case. The acquittal of policemen accused of raping a young girl Mathura in a police station led to country-wide protests in 1979-1980. The protests, widely covered by the national media, forced the Government to amend the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Indian Penal Code; and created a new offence, custodial rape. Female activists also united over issues such as female infanticide, <b>gender</b> <b>bias,</b> women's health, women's safety, and women's literacy.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{tend to be}} {{especially}} critical of conclusions that contradict their own views, and lenient towards those that match them. At the same time, established scientists {{are more likely than}} others to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals/publishers. There are also signs of <b>gender</b> <b>bias,</b> favouring men as authors. As a result, ideas that harmonize with the established experts' are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones. This accords with Thomas Kuhn's well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions. A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{show that}} {{education}} in Pakistan {{can be characterized}} by extensive gender inequalities. Girls/women have to face socio-cultural hurdles to acquire education.

The proponents of gender equality {{argue that it is}} not only humane and ethical thing to provide everyone easy access to education without any <b>gender</b> <b>bias,</b> but it is also essential for development and progress of a society that both men and women are educated. They also point towards empirical studies that have confirmed that gender inequality in education has significant impact on rural poverty in Pakistan, and female literacy is important for poverty alleviation. Feminists like Martha Nussbaum are arguing that there is an immediate need to increase the public expenditures on female education in order to achieve gender equality at all levels.|$|E
25|$|Violence {{against women}} is a {{widespread}} global occurrence with serious public health implications. This {{is a result of}} social and <b>gender</b> <b>bias.</b> Many societies in developing nations function on a patriarchal framework, where women are often viewed as a form of property and as socially inferior to men. This unequal standing in the social hierarchy has led women to be physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by men, both as children and adults. These abuses usually constitute some form of violence. Although children of both sexes do suffer from physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, and other forms of exploitation and violence, studies have indicated that young girls are far more likely than boys to experience sexual abuse. In a 2004 study on child abuse, 25.3% of all girls surveyed experienced some form of sexual abuse, a percentage that is three times higher than that of boys (8.7%).|$|E

25|$|The hip hop music genre and its {{subculture}} {{has been}} criticized for its <b>gender</b> <b>bias</b> and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. Gangsta rap artists such as Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys, and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men. Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder. These anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban African-American women. Hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.|$|E

This stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as [...] "non-economic" [...] phenomena. Including such labor in economic accounts removes substantial <b>gender</b> <b>bias</b> because women disproportionately perform those tasks. When that labor is unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women is ignored, literally devaluing their effort.|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} the <b>gender</b> <b>biases</b> {{that appear in}} popular press business books written by both female and male authors. These books have been published within the past five years, and have been listed in The 100 Best Business Books of All Time. Using discourse analysis and a theoretical framework, three main <b>gender</b> <b>biases</b> were evident: occupational stereotypes, gender-neutral language inconsistencies, and gender exclusion & alienation. <b>Gender</b> <b>biases</b> create perceptions of reality that influence people‟s choices in education, careers, and their interactions with one another. The main {{findings in this study}} show that in business books, men are perceived to be leaders more often, while women are relegated to supportive roles. Skilled work is perceived to be men‟s work, and unskilled work is perceived to be equal among men and women, which, in reality, is untrue. The attempts of these business books to be gender-neutral are weak with the main discourse being masculine. As well, there is evidence to support that male behaviours exclude women and alienate them from “masculine groups. ” The <b>gender</b> <b>biases</b> evident in business books further engender biases in organizations, which exclude women from senior leadership. Thus, this study shows business books are instruments that contribute to the glass ceiling by engendering the knowledge they provide...|$|R

This study examines how social dominance influences competency and likability ratings for men and women in leadership roles who violate gender stereotypes when working in either hierarchy-enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating jobs. The results indicate that leaders who exhibited stereotypical male characteristics were rated as more competent and leaders that exhibited stereotypical female characteristics were rated more likable...|$|R
