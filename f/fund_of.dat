Using data on government and private <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> science, preliminary estimation indicates that past government <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> science has not "crowded out" private <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> science.

Using a systematic literature review, we describe how the framework <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> knowledge has been adopted in the engineering education literature. <b>Funds</b> <b>of</b> knowledge is a conceptual framework that has been concerned with social justice issues around validity and impacts of deficit theorizing (a theory that points to the underachievement of minority groups on perceived deficiencies related to their culture).
