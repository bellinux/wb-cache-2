5000|$|A {{significant}} invention, {{which later}} {{had a profound}} effect on electronic music, was the audion in 1906. This was the first thermionic valve, or vacuum tube and which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and <b>electronic</b> <b>computation,</b> among other things. Other early synthesizers included the Telharmonium (1897), the Theremin (1919), Jörg Mager's Spharophon (1924) and Partiturophone, Taubmann's similar Electronde (1933), Maurice Martenot's ondes Martenot ("Martenot waves", 1928), Trautwein's Trautonium (1930). The Mellertion (1933) used a non-standard scale, Bertrand's Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the Emicon was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German Hellertion combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhof's Croix Sonore (1934), Ivor Darreg's microtonal 'Electronic Keyboard Oboe' (1937) and the ANS synthesizer, constructed by the Russian scientist Evgeny Murzin from 1937 to 1958.

He has done markedly original work on dynamical similarity in meteorology and his recent numerical calculations of air flow over mountains are believed to be the first realistic computations of their kind. In addition, he has contributed much to the detailed analysis of the salient features of large-scale atmospheric disturbances, including studies of the rainfall of depressions, the behavious of the tropopause, and the cloud systems associated with fronts. His work is characteristic of the younger school of dynamical meteorologists, and is doing much to make meteorology a more exact science than hitherto." ...|$|E

This PES is developed over the set of intermolecular coordinates. The <b>electronic</b> <b>computations</b> are carried out at the explicitly correlated coupled cluster method withsingle, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T) -F 12] level of theory in connection withthe augmented correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. An analytic representation of the 4 DPESis derived. Our extensive calculations confirm that “Slipped Parallel” is the most stable formand that the T-shaped structure corresponds to a transition state. Later on, this PES is employed forthe calculations of the vibrational energy levels of the dimer. Moreover, the temperature dependenceof the dimer second virial coefficient and of the first spectral moment of rototranslational collisioninducedabsorption spectrum is derived. For both quantities, a good agreement is found between ourvalues and the experimental data {{for a wide range}} of temperatures. This attests to the high qualityof our PES. Generally, our PES and results can be used for modeling CO 2 supercritical fluidityand examination of its role in planetary atmospheres.
