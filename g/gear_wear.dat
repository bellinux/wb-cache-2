However, the car helped prove much of the technology seen on later cars.

50|$|Attempting {{to select}} reverse while {{the vehicle is}} moving forward causes severe <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> (except in {{transmissions}} with synchromesh on the reverse gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out reverse directly from 5th gear to help prevent this. In order to engage reverse from 5th, the shift lever has to be moved to the center position between 3rd and 4th, then back over and into reverse. Another widespread solution places reverse {{to the left of}} 1st gear, instead of behind the 5th (where one might expect to find a 6th gear). Many newer six-speed manual transmissions have a collar under the shift knob which must be lifted to engage reverse. Other reverse lockout designs include having to push the shift lever inward, toward the floor, to allow engagement of reverse, or requiring the driver to exert additional force to move the shift lever into reverse.|$|E
5000|$|... where a is {{the axis}} distance, z1 and z2 are {{the number of}} cogs (teeth) {{for each of the}} two wheels (gears). These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of circular pitch. The module, just like the circular pitch, can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.|$|E

Critical operating parameters, such as loading and lubrication, affect the wear process in a very complex manner and lead the theoretical modelling to an imperfect zone of assumptions. Complexities in <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> mathematical modelling allow the researchers to use approximations for useful lifetime calculations. On the basis of modelling approximations and assumptions, organizations, such as American Gear Manufacturers' Association (AGMA) and British Standards (BS), provide gear useful lifetime formulations.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} common gear failure modes, tooth wear can produce {{nonlinear}} modulation sidebands in the vibration frequency spectrum. However, limited research has been reported in monitoring the <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> based on vibration due to the lack of tools which can effectively extract the small sidebands.

Using a combination of the peak value of MSB-SE and the coherence of MSB-SE, the overall information of gear transmission system can be obtained. Based on the amplitude of MSB-SE peaks, a dimensionless indicator is proposed to assess the effects of gear tooth wear.

40|$|Gears are {{important}} mechanical components for power transmissions. Tooth wear {{is one of}} the most common failure modes, which can present throughout a gear’s lifetime. It is significant to accurately monitor <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> progression in order to take timely predictive maintenances. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is an effective and non-intrusive approach which is able to monitor faults from both electrical and mechanical systems. However, little research has been reported in monitoring the <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> and estimating its severity based on MCSA. This paper presents a novel <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> monitoring method through a modulation signal bispectrum based motor current signal analysis (MSB-MCSA). For a steady gear transmission, it is inevitable to exist load and speed oscillations due to various errors including wears. These oscillations can induce small modulations in the current signals of the driving motor. MSB is particularly effective in characterising such small modulation signals. Based on these understandings, the monitoring process was implemented based on the current signals from a run-to-failure test of an industrial two stages helical gearbox under a moderate accelerated fatigue process. At the initial operation of the test, MSB analysis results showed that the peak values at the bifrequencies of gear rotations and the power supply can be effective monitoring features for identifying faulty gears and wear severity as they exhibit agreeable changes with gear loads. A monotonically increasing trend established by these features allows a clear indication of the <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> progression. The dismantle inspection at 477 hours of operation, made when one of the monitored features is about 123 % higher than its baseline, has found that there are severe scuffing wear marks on a number of tooth surfaces on the driving gear, showing that the gear endures a gradual wear process during its long test operation. Therefore, it is affirmed that the MSB-MSCA approach proposed is reliable and accurate for monitoring <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> deterioration...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{concentrate}} on acetal <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour and its performance prediction based on the extensive investigations on the gear thermal mechanical contact both experimentally and numerically. It has been found from the tests that acetal <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> rate will be increased dramatically when the load reaches a critical value for a specific geometry and running speed. The gear surface will wear slowly with a low specific wear rate if the gear is loaded below the critical one. The possible reason of the sudden increase in wear rate {{is due to the}} gear operating temperature reaching the material melting point under the critical load condition. Gear surface temperature has been then investigated in details through three components: ambient, bulk and flash temperatures. Through extensive experimental investigations and modelling on gear surface temperature variations, a general relation has been built up between gear surface temperature and gear load capacity. An approach for acetal gear transition torque prediction has been proposed and this method is based on the link between polymer <b>gear</b> <b>wear</b> rate and its surface temperature. The method has been related to test results under different operating speeds and gear geometries. Good agreements have been achieved between the proposed method predictions and experimental test results. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
