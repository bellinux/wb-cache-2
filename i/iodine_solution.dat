5|$|Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is {{also known}} as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a {{sensitive}} spot test for ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline <b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones. The iodine test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch-containing paper.|$|E
5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which is no longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An <b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E

25|$|Areas of the cervix which turn white {{after the}} {{application}} of acetic acid or have an abnormal vascular pattern are often considered for biopsy. If no lesions are visible, an <b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> may {{be applied to the}} cervix to help highlight areas of abnormality.|$|E
25|$|A {{colposcope}} is used {{to identify}} visible clues suggestive of abnormal tissue. It functions as a lighted binocular or monocular microscope to magnify {{the view of the}} cervix, vagina, and vulvar surface. Low magnification (2× to 6×) may be used to obtain a general impression of the surface architecture. 8x to 25x magnification are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix. High magnification together with green filter is often used to identify certain vascular patterns that may indicate the presence of more advanced pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Acetic acid solution and <b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> (Lugol's or Schiller's) are applied to the surface to improve visualization of abnormal areas.|$|E

6000|$|The {{object of}} Mr. Cavor's search was a {{substance}} that should be [...] "opaque"--he used some other word I have forgotten, but [...] "opaque" [...] conveys the idea--to [...] "all forms of radiant energy." [...] "Radiant energy," [...] he made me understand, was anything like light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays {{there was so much}} talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of Marconi, or gravitation. All these things, he said, radiate out from centres, and act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term [...] "radiant energy." [...] Now almost all substances are opaque to some form or other of radiant energy. Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much less so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transparent to light, but blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy, which passes through both <b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> and glass almost as though they were not interposed. And so on.|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of a Viton A accumulator in the Shuttle galley has been proposed to prevent overpressurization of the hot water supply system.

Coupons of Viton A were exposed for 24 hours to aqueous <b>iodine</b> <b>solutions</b> similar in quality to the Shuttle's potable water. Changes in the iodine residual were monitored to determine the rate of iodine sorption by the coupon. Total organic carbon (TOC) was monitored to determine the rate of desorption of organic materials from the Viton A.

The coupons were again exposed to <b>iodine</b> <b>solutions</b> for 24 hours and iodine and TOC were monitored.
