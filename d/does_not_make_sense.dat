If the player chooses a word that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> {{in the context of}} the play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E

It was not apparent however from the dialog why he thought option B <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense.</b> S 3 then puts forward C as the correct option because it showed “Na and Cl” (LN 2). S 4, {{another member of the}} group, asked if the correct response option should be “B or D” (LN 3). S 3 simply stated “it can’t be B” (LN 4) but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> rule out option D. S 2, on the other hand, refuted S 3 ’s suggestion of option C on the basis that “there is no H 2 O” (LN 5). S 2 seemed conflicted: in the initiating statement (LN 1), he argued option B <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> but also ruled out option C because “there is no H 2 O” (LN 5).|$|R

25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other.

25|$|A type system {{associates}} a type {{with each}} computed value and, {{by examining the}} flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general {{the aim is to}} prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> (logic errors); memory errors will also be prevented. Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.|$|E

The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps {{in front of the}} Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of self-sacrifice <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to Azal, and sends him into a confused rage. The Doctor tells everyone to flee the Church.

The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E

25|$|Following Secret Wars and the {{restoration}} of Earth-616 prior to the Incursions, Emma Frost is among a small team of X-Men that {{come into contact with}} the Terrigen mists at Muir Island, where they found Jamie Madrox dead on the facility grounds. Discovering that the Terrigen Mist cloud was toxic to mutants Scott and Emma formulate a plan to extinguish one of the Inhumans' Terrigen cloud. And while they are able to hold off the Inhumans just long enough to neutralize the green cloud, Cyclops is apparently killed by Black Bolt in self-defense. However at Scott's funeral, Alex is seen afar speaking to Emma that something <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> leading to Emma filling Alex in on some unrevealed details. Black Bolt did not kill Cyclops, in fact, he never made it out of the facility at Muir Island, as he suffered an immediate reaction to the Terrigen mists, dying in Emma Frost's arms. Since then Emma had been projecting an illusion of him to everyone else as a means of declaring war against the Inhumans in Scott's name.|$|E

500|$|This is {{not universally}} agreed upon. [...] Anton Bierl argues that Sappho's offer to pray to Hera is contrasted with a {{masculine}} ideology {{in which the}} pursuit of wealth is {{the solution to the}} family's problems, and therefore suggests a male relative of Sappho as the addressee of the poem. [...] Lardinois sees the argument that Sappho's mother could have gone to pray to Hera for her son's safe return herself, and therefore it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for her to send Sappho to do so on her behalf, as the strongest against the thesis that the addressee is Sappho's mother, arguing on this basis for a male addressee. [...] In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word [...] to describe their speech: meaning [...] "chattering" [...] or [...] "babbling", the word has negative connotations which would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man. [...] Anja Bettenworth has argued that the addressee is of a lower social status than Sappho, again based on the use of , but Kurke argues that the addressee is likely {{to be in a position}} of authority over Sappho, as Sappho expects them to send her to pray to Hera.|$|E
