40|$|Background: Cuba and Chile {{have the}} lower infant {{mortality}} rates of Latin America. Infant mortality rate in Cuba {{is similar to}} that of developed countries. Chilean infant mortality rate is slightly higher than that of Cuba. Aim: To investigate if the lower infant mortality rate in Cuba, compared to Chile, could be explained by <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion,</b> considering that abortion is legal in Cuba but not in Chile. Material and Methods: We compared total and congenital abnormalities related infant mortality in Cuba and Chile during 2008, based on vital statistics of both countries. Results: In 2008, infant mortality rates in Chile were significantly higher than those of Cuba (7. 8 vs. 4. 7 per 1, 000 live born respectively, odds ratio (OR) 1. 67; 95 % confidence intervals (Cl) 1. 52 - 1. 83). Congenital abnormalities accounted for 33. 8 and 19. 2 % of infant deaths in Chile and Cuba, respectively. Discarding infant deaths related to congenital abnormalities, infant mortality rate continued to be higher in Chile than in Cuba (5. 19 vs. 3. 82 per 1000 live born respectively, OR 1. 36; 95 %CI 1. 221. 52). Conclusions: Considering that antenatal diagnosis is widely available in both countries, but abortion is legal in Cuba but not in Chile, we conclude that <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion</b> may partially explain the lower infant mortality rate observed in Cuba compared to that observed in Chile...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{techniques}} that analyse the fetal nucleic acids present in maternal peripheral blood for {{the preparation of}} non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis, is a clinical reality {{in the case of}} certain diseases. In the coming years, it will become part of the routine monitoring for fetal diagnosis. This study analyzes the current status of these techniques as well as the major ethical issues arising from the relationship between - prenatal diagnosis and <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion,</b> and the specific problems posed by - prenatal genetic diagnosis based an analysis of the nucleic acids present in maternal peripheral blood. Among the conclusions are the following: we make a positive ethical evaluation of the technique when it is aimed at pregnant women who are in a situation of high risk, defined on the basis of medical standards and ethics, without compromising the integrity of the fetus. We make a negative ethical evaluation when non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis has a eugenic purpose and will establish a connection between prenatal diagnosis and <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion</b> in case of a positive result. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis increases the image of the disabled person as an individual that has to be excluded from society. The widespread use of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis will decrease the autonomy of women / couples {{when it comes to making}} decisions. Health authorities may use non-invasive prenatal diagnosis as a way of “preventing” genetic diseases, since it will lower costs, increase the number of malformed fetuses detected and a decrease the number of indirect abortions involving invasive techniques...|$|E

40|$|This volume {{explores the}} concept of Japanese {{reproductive}} rights and liberties {{in light of recent}} developments in disability studies. Masae Kato asks important questions about what constitutes personhood and how, in the twenty-first century, we come to understand <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion</b> and other bioethical arguments. Tracing the origin and influence of {{the concept of}} a "right," the author places the term in local social and historical contexts in order to determine that it still carries overtones of Anglo-American philosophy, rather than universal truth. Digging deeply into Japanese debates on selective abortion, Women's Right? discusses how this charged term can be both de-Westernized and de-masculinized, especially in its appropriations by the Japanese women's movement and disability scholars. Dit boek verkent het concept 'recht'. Hoe dit concept een rol heeft gespeeld in het veroorzaken van onenigheid en misvatting tussen bewegingen van gehandicapte mensen en vrouwen met betrekking tot de kwestie van selectieve abortus in Japan. Tegelijkertijd, probeert de schrijfster om het concept van recht te ontwesteren en te demasculiniseren door erover te theoretiseren hoe deze twee bewegingen de term interpreteerden, ondersteunden en in praktijk brachten. Zij laat ook zien dat het concept niet universeel is...|$|E
40|$|Com o espantoso avanço tecnológico dos exames pré-natais, reacende a discussão em torno do direito ao aborto. A possibilidade de se observar o desenvolvimento do feto, desde os seus primeiros momentos, e diagnosticar antecipadamente eventuais anomalias, cria uma situação jurídica nova sobre a possibilidade de interrupção da gravidez leia-se aborto quando constatadas deformidades que tornem o feto incompatível com a vida extra-uterina. Desde o início da década de 1990, centenas de decisões judiciais autorizaram a interrupção da gravidez em razão de grave anomalia fetal, principalmente nos casos de anencefalia. Os defensores dessa nova modalidade de aborto, o aborto eugênico, alegam que a eliminação do feto deve ser autorizada, pois ele não tem a mínima chance de sobreviver. Alguns chegam a defini-lo como natimorto, criando uma analogia entre a anencefalia e a morte cerebral. Além disso, afirmam que submeter a mulher a uma gravidez de um filho anencéfalo seria o mesmo que submetê-la a um tratamento cruel ou degradante, pois, ao final dos nove meses, seu filho irá perecer, o que significaria um enorme tormento para ela. Este trabalho tem o objetivo de alertar os defensores do aborto eugênico que o feto anômalo é um ser vivo e eliminá-lo, pelo fato de apresentar características físicas aquém das desejadas pelos seus pais, além de ser um crime agravado pela motivação de cunho preconceituoso, é o primeiro passo para a implantação de uma política eugênica, racista, de purificação da raça humana, rechaçada pela Constituição Federal brasileira. ABSTRACT The amazing {{technological}} advances in prenatal exams have reintroduced {{discussions on the}} right to abortion. The possibility of observing the development of the fetus since its early stages and being able to detect possible abnormalities in advance creates a new legal scenario involving the possibility of ending pregnancy before its term that is, abortion when doctors verify the existence of malformation that can make life outside the womb impossible. Since the early 1990 s, hundreds of court decisions have authorized the early ending of pregnancy in view of a serious fetal abnormality, mainly in the cases of anencephaly. The defenders of this new type of abortion, the so-called <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion,</b> allege that the elimination of the fetus should be authorized as it does not stand any chances of surviving. Some define it as a stillborn child, thus creating an analogy between anencephaly and brain death. Moreover, they say that submitting a woman to withstand pregnancy of an anencephalic child can be compared to submitting her to cruel or degrading treatment, as, {{at the end of the}} nine-month term the child will die, which means the mother will suffer unbearable distress. The purpose of this work is to alert the defenders of <b>eugenic</b> <b>abortion</b> that the abnormal fetus is a living being and eliminating it on the grounds that it shows physical characteristics that do not meet the parents expectations is a crime aggravated by motivation based on prejudice and, further, it is the first step towards the implementation of a eugenic, racist policy, leading to the purification of the human race, which has been repelled by the Brazilian Constitution...|$|E

50|$|Legalization of {{abortion}} was first widely discussed in Germany {{during the early}} 20th century. When Germany became a country in 1871, section 218 of the Constitution outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for both {{the woman and the}} doctor involved. During the Weimar Republic, such discussion led to a reduction in the maximum penalty for abortion, and in 1926 — by a court's decision — to the legalization {{of abortion}} in cases of grave danger {{to the life of the}} mother. Nazi Germany's <b>eugenics</b> laws liberalized <b>abortion</b> for both Aryan and non-Aryan women. Aryan women could obtain an abortion simply by demonstrating that either parent had an hereditary defect or that the child would be born with a congenital defect. Non-Aryan women were encouraged to contracept and abort, in order to reduce their population.|$|R

40|$|To situate the North American, {{and to some}} extent, European debate {{regarding}} disability {{rights and}} prenatal diagnosis in a social and cross-cultural context, this pilot study explored the views of leaders of organizations for disability rights and support groups for people with genetic conditions in Israel, where a similar debate has not emerged. Unlike many of their counterparts in North America, Israeli respondents were generally in favor of prenatal genetic testing as well as selective abortion, {{while at the same}} time expressing their commitment for already-born disabled individuals. The religious, legal, economic and socio-cultural context of this two-fold view of disability [...] which separates prenatal (preventive testing) and postnatal (supporting disability) [...] is discussed in order to further situate the debate in cross-cultural perspective. It is hypothesized that prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion are supported in secular Israeli society independently of the rabbinical stance, which forbids selective abortion, and in a way that reflects society's non-acceptance of congenital disability, veneration of the healthy body, and medical directiveness.

5000|$|During the Spanish Civil War, Montseny {{supported}} the republican government. She rejected {{the violence in}} the republican held territory: [...] "a lust for blood inconceivable in honest man before". In November 1936 Francisco Largo Caballero appointed Montseny as Minister of Health. In doing so, she became the first woman in Spanish history to be a cabinet minister. She {{was one of the first}} female ministers in Western Europe (but preceded by Danish Minister of Education, Nina Bang and Miina Sillanpää of Finland), and as minister she aimed to transform public health to meet the needs of the poor and working class. To that end, she supported decentralized, locally responsive and preventative health care programs that mobilized the entire working class for the war effort. She was influenced by the anarchist sex reform movement, which since the 1920s had focused on reproductive rights, and was minister in 1936 when Dr. Félix Martí Ibáñez, the anarchist director general of Health and Social Assistance of the Generalitat de Catalunya, issued the <b>Eugenic</b> Reform of <b>Abortion,</b> a decree effectively making abortion on demand legal in Catalonia. Given her family's libertarian tradition, the decision to enter the Popular Front government was especially difficult. Although joining the government was a move encouraged by the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), this collaboration with the government in order to present a united front to the Fascist threat posed by Francisco Franco's rebel armies, was widely questioned during and long after the war was over. Notably, she was involved in polemics with Emma Goldman, and the recipient of the harsh criticism in Camillo Berneri's open letter of 1937. For many anarchists, the topic of collaborationwith both Marxists and governmentsis still a contentious one.|$|R
