40|$|From a {{theoretical}} perspective, Islamic banking and finance {{is different from}} conventional banking and finance because interest (riba) is prohibited in Islam. The unique feature of Islamic banking and finance is its profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) paradigm. As such, the equity stock market mechanism follows this unique PLS paradigm without the involvement of riba, gharar and maysir, allowing Shari’a sensitive investors’ access to the stock market. But the problem is to identify the Shari’a compliant equity stocks (that are both Shari’a compliant in the capital structure {{as well as the}} underlying business) within the equity stock market. In order to assist the Shari’a sensitive investors, the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI) {{for the first time in}} history issued the first Shari’a screening methodology in 1999 that facilitated access to the stock market. Subsequently, a number of other Shari’a screening methodologies have been developed by other index providers, banks and regulators; all of them are derivatives of the DJIMI. The rules used in the screening process have not originated from the Holy Quran or the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and accordingly are not considered absolute rules. These screening methodologies have been criticised in the literature for being imprecise, inconsistent, lacking credibility and on the use of Shari’a screening thresholds restricting the Shari’a non-compliant activities. The study is designed to address two main areas: 1) to examine the historical development of Shari’a screening methodologies to date, and 2) to investigate how the existing Shari’a screening methodologies can be enhanced for the benefit of the Islamic banking and finance (IBF) industry. A qualitative analysis is carried out in the first part of the study. A statistical technique of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is carried out in the second part of the study. The examination of the first part of the study shows that the fundamental variables underlying existing screening methodologies should be based on actual interest income and interest expense as it’s the actual interest received or paid that is Shari’a non-compliant instead of on the basis of source of funds (<b>debt,</b> <b>receivables).</b> This part of the study also finds that the Shari’a screening methodologies were introduced as a need of the time under Maslahah (public interest and rule of exception). It was expected that scholars and practitioners would review and revise the screening methodologies over time to ensure adherence to Shari’a. However, they have remained the same while the Islamic banking and finance industry has developed significantly. Further examination of current practices, suggested Shari’a screening thresholds to be dynamic and ones based on the growth and development in Islamic banking and finance. Based on findings of the first part, the study conducted an exploratory analysis in the second part using different portfolios and screened them based on interest income and interest expense and compared with existing practices. It is recommended that Shari'a screening methodologies incorporate these screening filters in addition to the existing filters to ensure that the portfolio remains Shari'a compliant. Further, the study in the second part developed an IBF index using exploratory factor analysis to quantify the development in IBF industry in 41 countries. These countries were placed in five groups (leaders, developed countries, developing countries, emerging markets and least developed countries) and it was concluded that Shari’a screening thresholds for countries based in groups “leaders” and “developed countries” can be lowered to 20...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{securitization}} {{of financial}} assets {{is a form}} of structured finance, developed by the U. S. banking world in the early 1980 ’s (in Mortgage-Backed-Securities format) in order to reduce regulatory capital requirements by removing and transferring risk from the balance sheet to other parties. Today, virtually any form of <b>debt</b> obligations and <b>receivables</b> has been securitized, resulting in an approx $ 2. 5 trillion ABS outstanding in the U. S. alone ∗, a market which is rapidly spreading to Europe, Latin-America and Southeast Asia. Though no two ABS contracts are the same and therefore each deal requires its very own model, there are three important features which appear in virtually any securitization deal: default risk, Loss-Given-Default and prepayment risk. In this paper we will only be concerned with default and prepayment and discuss a number of traditional (continuous) and Lévy-based (pure jump) methods for modeling the latter risks. After briefly explaining the methods and their underlying intuition, the models are applied to a simple ABS deal {{in order to determine the}} rating of the notes. It turns out that the pure jump models produce lower (i. e. more conservative) ratings than the traditional methods (e. g.

40|$|Topic: The {{study is}} linked to the concept of a group of companies. A group {{is at the same time}} a legal and {{economical}} phenomenon. An international group of companies consists of companies and permanent establishments located in different states. The study covers not only subsidiaries to be consolidated to the group financial statement, but also associated enterprises where the group’s ownership can be below 50 % and which will not, therefore, be consolidated. Such associated enterprises which do not belong to the group under accounting and company laws can have a firm connection to the group. Regarding taxation, attention will be paid to the conditions and terms concluded inside the group. Adjustments can also become a factor in relation associated enterprises which are not consolidated if the conditions and terms concluded deviate from what would have been agreed on at the open market. The main goal of the thesis is to find out how international regulation created within the OECD and EU harmonises the taxation of interest payments between associated enterprises. The study consists of the levels of tax treaty law, European Community law and domestic tax law. From these three levels, the focus is on European Community law or in a wider context on the European Union. The main research methods are legal dogmatic and comparative law. The comparative part of the study focuses on the tax systems of the United States of America, Germany, Estonia and Finland. The macro level comparison covers not only domestic international laws, tax treaties, case law and other official documents, but also customary methods of interpretation, ways of transposing international agreements into the national legal order and carrying out international law obligations in the respective countries. These countries have been chosen from the Finnish point-of-view. The United States was a significant capital exporting country before the current economical recession. The U. S. tax treaty policy and domestic international tax laws have had a great impact on other countries’ tax systems. Economically, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Relatively speaking, most of the preliminary references referred to the European Court of Justice dealing with direct income tax law are made by German courts. Estonia is interesting from the Finnish perspective due to geographical reasons and tax competition. The study also covers the Swedish tax system quite deeply. Sweden was not included in the macro level comparison because group taxation systems are similar in Finland and Sweden. The two countries also joined the EU at the same time. Micro level comparison, which examines specific legal institutions, was carried out with Belgium, Denmark, France, India, Mexico and the Netherlands as examples. Structure The study has ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the goals, methodology, limitations and sources of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents principles and goals which affect interpretation of tax law. The principles of legality and equality may be legally enforced, whereas ability to pay, neutrality and fairness are goals for the improvement of the society’s social feature. Chapter 2 first discusses the sources of international taxation from international law and treaties before and moving on to international tax law and its interpretation. European tax law is studied from a critical perspective. The impact of acquis communautaire on national tax systems has been compared to a jack-in-the-box which lowers the predictability of tax assessment. Chapter 3 deals with the history of direct tax harmonisation and the current possibilities to cross-border loss-relief. The European Commission’s initiatives for group taxation - Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and Home State Taxation - are discussed. Thin capitalisation and transfer pricing problems would be eliminated if these initiatives were adopted. Companies taking part into unitary taxation would be fiscally consolidated at a group level. Corporate tax harmonisation could go further than this in theory. An EU tax would eliminate the current constitutional problems. The EU tax would create a direct tax link between the EU and its citizens. The EU’s political accountability would be improved if the European Parliament’s involvement in the adoption of tax laws was increased. Chapter 4 presents group financing from a taxation point-of-view. Debt financing may provide tax benefits in cross-border situations. Interest payments are usually deductible expenses, whereas dividend paid to a foreign parent company may usually not be deducted out of company profits. The differential tax treatment of debt and equity may imply tax-planning opportunities for group financing. Groups of companies may strive to allocate group financing companies into low-tax jurisdictions where the general tax rate is low, and extend intercompany loans into high-tax jurisdictions where the benefit of a tax deduction is high. Equity investments also provide tax-planning opportunities. The international tax treaty network and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminate taxation at source from intra-group dividends as well. Chapter 5 examines the concept of an associated enterprise. The concept of an associated enterprise is defined differently in the OECD Model Tax Convention and the Interest and Royalties Directive. International accounting standards and domestic accounting and tax laws also define the concept using their own criteria. A company belonging to a group of companies may, in practice, be an associated company under accounting laws but fall outside the scope of the Interest and Royalties Directive. Chapters 6 - 9 deal with the concept of interest, taxation principles, interest deductions and transfer pricing issues dealing with interest and financing. Interest is commonly considered to be return on debt capital. The concept of interest has not been defined in the Finnish Income Tax Act or Business Income Tax Act. The Act on Taxation of Income of a Person Subject to Limited Tax Liability contains a definition of interest which is applied between associated companies located in different EU member states. Interest, according to the Act, means any income from debt-claims whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. The legal concept of interest is generally equal to the economic concept of interest. Return on zero-coupon bonds and perpetual loans are considered to be interest. The amount of interest is determined by percentage of interest, time and debt. Debt is characterized by the debtor-creditor relationship and the absence of participation rights. Finnish tax law does not explicitly rule how to draw a line between debt and equity. The classification of hybrid instruments under civil law is generally a starting-point. The classification is also based on case law. The economic substance of an instrument can be considered. There are no published cases where hybrid equity would have been reclassified as debt for tax purposes. Debt has been reclassified as equity only in a few cases. According to the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, interest generally means remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income form movable capital”. Article 11 OECD states that interest means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits and income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, in particular. There is an interconnection between interest and dividends in the Articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Interest on participating bonds should normally not be considered as a dividend; also, interest on convertible bonds should not be considered as a dividend before the bonds are actually converted as shares. It may be difficult to make a distinction between interest and dividend in situations of thin capitalisation. If the repayment of loan largely depends on the success of an enterprise, interest paid on such loans may be taxed as a dividend. The Contracting States may widen Article 11 OECD as to include any income which is taxed as interest under their domestic laws. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the arm’s principle shall be followed in group financing. The arm’s length principle requires that associated enterprises shall apply market based interest rate and other financing terms to their internal <b>debts</b> and <b>receivables.</b> The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not, however, indicate how an arm’s length interest rate should be determined. The comparable uncontrolled price method is usually the preferred method for determining an arm’s length interest rate. It can be challenging to find loan agreements which would be sufficiently close comparables as to type, quality and quantity with an intercompany loan. The cost plus method has also been suggested as a suitable method for evaluating a current interest rate. With regard to comparables, an internal uncontrolled comparable would be preferred. External comparables will nevertheless be used in many cases. Group interest rates can be compared with market interest rates or a simulated credit rating can be carried out. Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and discusses future scenarios on interest deductions in Finland. Finland does not have statutory thin capitalisation rules. The Finnish approach is liberal toward thin capitalisation. The tax authorities evaluate a company’s financing structure as a whole. Attention will be paid to the company’s debt to equity ratio and whether interest is paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Debt push-down structures have been widely used. Highly-leveraged financing structures have been subject to tax audits. It is fairly common to declare that debt to equity ratio 15 : 1 is accepted in Finland. This|$|R
