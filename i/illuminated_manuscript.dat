5|$|Pope Paul III came to {{the papal}} throne (1534–1549) after the sack of Rome in 1527, with {{uncertainties}} prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of Alessandro Farnese (cardinal), who had paintings by Titian, Michelangelo, and Raphael, {{as well as an}} important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of Giulio Clovio, arguably the last major <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript,</b> the Farnese Hours.|$|E
5|$|Western Christianity, {{particularly}} {{through its}} monasteries, {{was a major}} factor in preserving classical civilisation, with its art (see <b>Illuminated</b> <b>manuscript)</b> and literacy. Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c.480–543), {{one of the founders of}} Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as St Columbanus and St Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript,</b> and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous.|$|E

25|$|Gothic art and {{architecture}} were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, International Gothic, which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into Renaissance art. The primary Gothic art media were sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco, and <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{illuminated}} manuscripts {{were created}} as codices, which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript</b> fragments survive on papyrus. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of calf, sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts {{important enough to}} illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum, traditionally made of unsplit calfskin, though high quality parchment from other skins was also called parchment.|$|E
25|$|The Sarajevo Haggadah is an <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript</b> that {{contains}} the illustrated traditional text of the Passover Haggadah which accompanies the Passover Seder.

Its monetary value is undetermined, but a museum in Spain required that it be insured for $7 million before it could be transported to an exhibition there in 1992.|$|E

25|$|He was {{probably}} from Brescia, {{and is known}} to have lived in that city for several periods of his life, although he was in Venice in 1517 and for some time after that, the period during which the <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript</b> was prepared.

25|$|Crusader art was {{a mix of}} Western, Byzantine, and Islamic styles. The {{major cities}} {{featured}} baths, interior plumbing, and other advanced hygienic tools which were lacking in most other cities and towns throughout the world. The foremost example of crusader art are perhaps the Melisende Psalter, an <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript</b> commissioned between 1135 and 1143 and now located in the British Library, and the sculpted Nazareth Capitals. Paintings and mosaics were popular forms {{of art in the}} kingdom, but many of these were destroyed by the Mamluks in the 13th century; only the most durable fortresses survived the reconquest.|$|E
25|$|The Llanbeblig Book of Hours (NLW MS 17520A) {{is a small}} {{manuscript}} book compiled around 1390. The manuscript has {{a number}} of entries in the calendar that connect it to Wales, including a celebration of the dedication of the church of Saint Peblig, Caernarfon. Isabella Godynogh (d. 1413) was possibly its original owner. The full-page miniatures, illuminated with gold, and the fine lettering indicate the value of the book. The Llanbeblig Hours is the only known <b>illuminated</b> <b>manuscript</b> that contains the iconographical Lily Crucifixion motif, and may be the earliest example of its use in any media.|$|E
