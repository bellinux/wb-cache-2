Purpose: The usefulness of a recently developed PET tracer, [methyl-(11) C] thymidine ([methyl-(11) C] TdR) is explored in brain tumors. Patients and Methods: Twenty patients with confirmed tumoral and non-tumoral brain lesions were investigated with [methyl-C- 11] TdR PEI: The C- 11 activity was visually and quantitatively assessed. In two patients, dynamic scans were performed. The PET findings were compared to those of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the brain and to the final diagnosis. Results: Eight out of ten patiens with confirmed tumoral lesions or tumor recurrence had increased C- 11 activity within the lesion. In ten non-tumoral lesions no increased C- 11 uptake was found. The dynamic PET studies showed that [methyl-C- 11] TdR first acts as a blood flow tracer, but that later an the uptake of C- 11 activity is due to labeled metabolites, crossing the blood-brain barrier. Increased tracer activity was only observed in tumoral and not in non-tumoral contrast-enhanced lesions on MRT or CI: Conclusions: [Methyl-C- 11] TdR is not a selective PET radiopharmaceutical for brain tumors, but {{can be used as a}} tracer for tumoral blood-brain barrier disruption...|$|R

The perfor-mance of the framework has been evaluated against 1172 real users, and {{results show that the}} yield obtained by rec-ommended portfolios overcomes that of portfolios proposed by human advisors in many experimental settings. 1. MOTIVATIONS AND METHODOLOGY Widespread recommendation approaches, such as content-based (CB) and collaborative filtering (CF), can hardly put into practice in the domain of financial recommendations. Typically, pure CB strategies are likely to fail since content information describing both users and financial products is too poor to feed a CB recommendation algorithm. More-over, the over-specialization problem, typical of CB recom-menders, collide with the fact that turbulence and fluctu-ations in financial markets suggest to change and diversify the investments over time. On the other side, CF algorithms may lead to the problem of flocking, since user-based CF could move many (similar) users to invest in the same asset classes at the same time, making the algorithm victim of potential trader attacks 2. As a consequence, we focused the attention on different recommendation paradigms. Given that financial advisors have to analyze and sift through several investment portfo-lios 3 before providing the user with a solution able to meet his investment goals, the insight behind our recommendation 1 This work <b>fullfils</b> the research objectives of the projects ObjectWay-Finance-as-a-Service: Smart Application soft...|$|R

Rabbits were infected with 2  ×  104 hemagglutination units of an RHD virus isolate. Apoptosis was documented {{by the presence of}} caspase- 3 activity and substantial PARP proteolysis at 36 and 48  h postinfection (pi). Infection induced a marked and maintained expression of TNF-α from 12 h pi, while there was only a transitory increase in IL- 6 expression. Expression of phosphorylated (p) -JNK, p-p 38 and p-ERK 1 / 2 was significantly elevated at 12  h pi. At 48  h pi p-JNK expression was maintained at a maximum level, while that of p-p 38 returned to normality and there was no p-ERK 1 / 2 expression. Activation of NF-κB and AP- 1 and increased expression of VCAM- 1 and COX- 2 were observed. No significant changes were detected in activation of STAT 1 and STAT 3, while SOCS 3 expression increased significantly. The current findings suggest that activation of JNK is an essential component in liver injury mediated by the RHD virus and that lack of activation of STAT 3, probably mediated by SOCS 3 over-expression, would contribute to the inhibition of the regenerative response.

40|$|Modularisation is of intrest to the EA {{community}} as a mechanism to allow evolution to address larger problems. Starting from basic elements modularisation could {{make it possible to}} reuse higher level functionalities discovered during the evolutionary search process. This text presents a compression based extension of the standard genetic algorithm. By adding a compression operation in the loop of a genetic algorithm (GA) a simple modularisation mechanism is obtained. This compression is applied to the genotypes present in the population. Promising allele combinations are replaced by a shorter representation, i. e. a single symbol, thus results in a compressed representation. This placeholder symbol is then added to the genetic alphabet. The GA extended with compression is called the compressed genetic algorithm (cGA). The compression scheme <b>fullfils</b> two goals. First, compression aims at protecting building blocks from crossover by shortening them. A second goal is to obtain a form of code reuse, this is achieved by complementing the basic genetic alphabet with the placeholder symbols. The combination of the protection against crossover and code reuse makes it possible for the cGA to improve upon the GA. Critical to the performance of the cGA is the length l of the allele combinations being compressed as well the identification of good combinations. The length of the combinations is a parameter set by the user. The selection of the combinations is based on their repeated occurence within a pool of above average individuals. This criterion has the advantage of relying on the information already present in the population. When combined with an evaluator the cGA forms a compressed linear genetic programming (cl-GP) system. This system uses a linear encoding reminescent from [...] ...|$|R

Structural and functional analysis of PIIN 29 showed that it <b>fullfils</b> the definition of a fungal effector candidate, and possesses E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. The transcription level of PIIN 29 is induced during Arabidopsis root colonized by P. indica as shown by real time PCR in different conditions. Heterologous expression of mature version of PIIN 29 (without its native signal peptide) driven by CaMV 35 S promoter in Arabidopsis (PIIN 29 OE) results in higher colonization rates of P. indica and pathogen of B. cinerea compared with wild type Col- 0. Moreover, PIIN 29 OE inhibits the production of ROS in response to both flg 22 and chitin, decreased transcription of defense genes such as AtWRKY 22, and abolished callose deposition elicited by flg 22. To investigate the cytology of P. indica during symbiosis, the result of TEM represented that P. indica differentiates biotrophic hyphal bodies penetrated into barley root cytoplasm. Based on in silico analysis, 17 SSPs containing the conserved C-terminal motif RSIDELD are involved in interested effector candidates.

A minor field study was carried out in Dar es Salaam in April 2014. The study was limited to Dar es Salaam, the economic capital of Tanzania, because it holds the majority of the media. Three different residential areas were chosen for the study, these were Mwananyamala, which is a low-income area, Sinza, middle–income and Mikocheni, high–income. A survey questionnaire was distributed in each area, 30 in Mwananyamala, 31 in Sinza and 30 in Mikocheni, and in every area four interviews was preformed. According to the selection group there is plenty of healthcare information in the media that is useful to the audience but it is not seen to be very varied. Most information is about malaria and HIV/AIDS, which are two of the most common diseases in Tanzania, but many call for a broader reporting on health issues.

Essential minerals (copper, iron, and manganese) and unintentionally present metals, so called contaminants (arsenic, cadmium and lead), were analysed in close to 100 different products intended for infants and young children. For comparison, a composite sample of human breast milk from 90 women was analysed as well. The samples were analysed by ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) using two different methods. One method is accredited for the analysed contaminants and minerals, and <b>fullfils</b> the criteria for official control of levels of contaminants (lead and cadmium) in foodstuffs. The other method is not accredited but has a higher sensitivity and thus lower concentrations could be quantified. The concentration of the contaminants ranged from below 0. 001 up to 0. 04 milligrams per kilogram ‘ready for use’ product. The highest concentrations of arsenic (0. 04 mg/kg) were found in rice-based products whereas processed cerealbased foods (PCBF) contained the largest amounts of cadmium (up to 0. 01 mg/kg). The highest lead concentrations (up to 0. 02 mg/kg) were found in foods for special medical purposes (FSMP, e. g. products intended for children with allergy or inborn errors of metabolism). Minerals had been intentionally added to most products intended for infants and young children. The highest average concentrations of minerals were found in FSMP for young children.

40|$|By {{tracing the}} process of the {{evolving}} myth surrounding the empress Elisabeth of Austria since her death one would very likely find an almost continuous sinusoidal curve as a result. The aim of the thesis is to explore the question which mediating sociopolitical functions the myth <b>fullfils</b> and where its value lies within the national and historical myth systems (the ones of Austria and also Prussia/Germany) by analysing audio-visual media, especially films. Since the representations of the Empress during the 20. century have been mainly manifested within popular culture, printed media, like e. g. newspapers, magazines, biograhies will also be considered for the analysis as well as theatrical plays like operas and musical comedies. The thesis stresses that the myth of Empress Elizabeth of Austria {{can be seen as a}} set of essential kernels, in structuralism theory called ‚mythemes’, that can constantly get reassembled and re-told. The mythemes and the actualizations of the myth itself are to be elaborated as well as its different cultural functionalisations at different times by diachronical and a synchronical readings. The thesis is trying to fill the gap of the frequently stated absence of female figures within the field of myth research and points out functions of a contemporary myth and its different appearances. Beyond that those procedures and strategies of media will be addressed that lead a long constituted myth into serving as a collective character or figure which can continously be applicated into new thematic contexts. The main proposition of the thesis is that the representations of Empress Elizabeth of Austria during the 20 th century have gotten adjusted to the sociocultural contexts of the particular time they have appeared in. The character of the Empress has therefore been utilized as a carrier for different ideologies, e. g. the idea of the multiethnic state of the Habsburgian Empire, as well as the national socialists idea of a the ethnic community, the ‚Volksgemeinschaft’.
