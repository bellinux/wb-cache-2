40|$|The {{influence}} of reaction order and trap-assisted recombination on continuous-wave photoinduced absorption measurements is clarified through analytical calculations and numerical simulations. The results reveal the characteristic {{influence of}} different trap distributions and enable distinguishing between shallow exponential and Gaussian distributions {{as well as}} systems dominated by <b>direct</b> <b>recombination</b> by analyzing the temperature dependence of the in-phase and quadrature signals. The identifying features are the intensity dependence of the in-phase at high intensity, PA_I∝ I^γ_HI, and the frequency dependence of the quadrature at low frequency, PA_Q∝ω^γ_LF. For <b>direct</b> <b>recombination</b> γ_HI and γ_LF are temperature independent, for an exponential distribution they depend on the characteristic energy E_ch as γ_HI= 1 /(1 +E_ch/kT) and γ_LF=kT/E_ch while a Gaussian distribution shows γ_HI and γ_LF as functions of I and ω, respectively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compute the {{emission}} {{coming from the}} <b>direct</b> <b>recombination</b> of free electrons to a given shell (n>= 2) during the epoch of cosmological hydrogen recombination. This contribution leads {{to a total of}} one photon per recombined hydrogen atom and therefore a ~ 30 - 88 % increase of the recombination spectrum within the frequency range 1 GHz<=nu<= 100 GHz. In particular the Balmer-continuum emission increases the distortion at nu~ 690 GHz by ~ 92 %. With our 100 shell calculations for the hydrogen atom we find that a total of ~ 5 photons per hydrogen atom are emitted when including all the bound-bound transitions, the 2 s two-photon decay channel and the optically thin free-bound transitions. Since the <b>direct</b> <b>recombination</b> continuum at high n is very broad only a few n-series continuua are distinguishable and most of this additional emission below nu<~ 30 GHz is completely featureless.

40|$|A <b>direct</b> repeat <b>recombination</b> assay between SUP 4 heteroalleles detects {{unrepaired}} heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) as sectored colonies. The {{frequency of}} unrepaired heteroduplex {{is dependent on}} the mismatch and is highest in a construct that generates C:C or G:G mispairs and lowest in one that generates T:G or C:A mispairs. In addition, unrepaired hDNA increases for all mismatches tested in pms 1 mismatch repair-deficient strains. These results support the notion that hDNA is formed across the SUP 4 repeats during the recombination event and is then subject to mismatch repair. The effects of various repair and recombination defective mutations on this assay were examined. Unrepaired heteroduplex increases significantly only in rad 52 mutant strains. In addition, <b>direct</b> repeat <b>recombination</b> is reduced 2 -fold in rad 52 mutant strains, while in rad 51, rad 54, rad 55 and rad 57 mutants <b>direct</b> repeat <b>recombination</b> is increased 3 - 4 -fold. Mutations in the excision repair gene, RAD 1, do not affect the frequency of <b>direct</b> repeat <b>recombination.</b> However, the level of unrepaired heteroduplex is slightly decreased in rad 1 mutant strains. Similar to previous studies, rad 1 rad 52 double mutants show a synergistic reduction in <b>direct</b> repeat <b>recombination</b> (35 -fold). Interestingly, unrepaired heteroduplex is reduced 4 -fold in the double mutants. Experiments with shortened repeats suggest that the reduction in unrepaired heteroduplex is due to decreased hDNA tract length in the double mutant strain...|$|R

30|$|Although with {{different}} working modules, {{most of the}} genome-editing tools share the same editing methodology by introducing double stranded-breaks (DSBs) into a desired genomic site. Cells react to DSBs by initiating DNA repair processes, either through non-homology end joining (NHEJ) or homology <b>directed</b> <b>recombination</b> (HDR). DNA repaired by NHEJ is error-prone, which can introduce small insertions or deletions (indels) into a genomic locus—causing frameshift thus knocking out the gene in coding region, or destroying a DNA regulation element in non-coding region; whereas DNA repaired by HDR {{can be used to}} introduce precise single nucleotide alterations or insert a whole gene into a specific genomic locus by providing an exogenous DNA template. When multiple DSBs have been made simultaneously into the cells (so called “multiplex”), chromatin structure changes, such as truncation, or even translocation or duplication, can also be made, albeit at a relatively lower rate (Hsu et al., 2014; Wang and Qi, 2016).|$|R

A major limitation to its application in gene therapy is the size of Cas 9 (> 4 kb), impeding its efficient delivery via recombi-nant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Therefore, we developed a split–Cas 9 system, bypassing the pack-aging limit using split-inteins. Each Cas 9 half was fused to the corresponding split-intein moiety and, only upon co-expression, the intein-mediated trans-splicing occurs and the full Cas 9 protein is recon-stituted.
