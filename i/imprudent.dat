The newspaper had printed some articles of a pro-German nature and the committee thought it <b>imprudent</b> but not disloyal of Speyer to have lent the money.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de Santa Anna, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was <b>imprudent,</b> and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.|$|E

25|$|He {{travelled}} to New York in 1907, {{where he}} drew some comic strips, such as Cats About Town and Grimalkin, for Hearst newspapers. His work was widely admired, although his critical {{attitude towards the}} city made him the subject of sniping in the press. He returned home with even less money than before, due to <b>imprudent</b> investment in {{a new type of}} oil lamp.|$|E

25|$|Several of the Zanj {{were eager}} {{to follow up on}} their victory and urged 'Ali ibn Muhammad to march on Basra itself. 'Ali, however, {{rejected}} this advice as <b>imprudent</b> and counseled his followers that they should instead force the enemy to seek them out. He then withdrew to a safe area and ordered his men to build huts for a camp. The Zanj resumed their raiding activities, attacking the surrounding villages and stealing property.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{fashionable to}} blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many <b>imprudent</b> lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E
25|$|Frost {{concluded}} {{the decision to}} sign construction contracts {{so close to the}} November 2014 state election was <b>imprudent</b> and exposed the state to significant cost and risk when it knew there was a significant risk that legal challenges would prevent it from proceeding. He said the project’s business case had not clearly established the need for the investment; {{had not been able to}} demonstrate the accuracy and plausibility of the assumed wider economic benefits; had not addressed major concerns by peer reviewers over traffic modelling raised; and had not provided a sound basis for prioritising the eastern section over other sections of the road. Frost said the decision to start work first on the eastern section had been a government policy decision rather than being based on cost-benefit analysis.|$|E
25|$|Gessner first {{attended}} the Carolinum in Zürich, then later entered the Fraumünster seminary. There he studied classical languages, appearing as Penia (Poverty) in Aristophanes' Pluto, {{at the age}} of 15. In school, he impressed his teachers so much that a few of them helped sponsor him so that he could further his education, including arranging a scholarship for him to attend university in France to study theology (1532–1533) {{at the age of}} 17. There he {{attended the}} Bourges and University of Paris. But religious persecution forced him to leave Paris for Strassburg, but being unable to secure employment, returned to Zürich. One of his teachers in Zürich acted as a foster father to him {{after the death of his}} father at the Battle of Kappel (1531), another provided him with three years of board and lodging, while yet another arranged his further education at the upper school in Strassbourg, the Strassbourg Academy. There he broadened his knowledge of ancient languages by studying Hebrew. In 1535, religious unrest drove him back to Zürich, where he made what some considered an <b>imprudent</b> marriage at the age of 19, of a woman from another poor family who had no dowry. Although some of his friends again came to his aid, he was appointed to obtaining a teaching position for him, this was in the lowest class and attracted a stipend barely more than a pittance. However he then obtained paid leave of absence to study medicine at the University of Basel (1536).|$|E
25|$|To explain {{himself to}} the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his {{departure}} was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not be shed in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent John, Queen Maria, Prince Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal), and the Infante Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) were all in a single ship. This was an <b>imprudent</b> decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and the infantas were on two other ships. The {{number of people who}} embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom had to sleep huddled in the open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. Furthermore, the flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony's first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and the infantas held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{thought that}} {{marriage}} {{was not only}} important between two individuals but for their families. A nephew of his later said, [...] "Our Late Honble & worthy Unkle Presid Lee said that the first fall & ruin of families and estates was mostly Occasioned by <b>Imprudent</b> Matches to Imbeggar families and estates & to beget a race of beggars." [...] He was engaged to Jenny Wilson in 1716. That year he returned to England to formalize the lease to the plantation before he married. Before his return, Jenny Wilson had found another husband, James Roscoe. Lee learned this from William Byrd.|$|E
500|$|Design work on {{what became}} the Illinois class began on 25 March 1896, when Rear Admiral J. G. Walker convened a board to {{consider}} future battleship designs. At this time, the only modern battleship in service was the low-freeboard the high-freeboard battleship [...] and the low-freeboard [...] were under construction. As the Navy had little experience with modern battleships, the question settled on whether to repeat one of the low-freeboard designs, which were suitable for coast defense, to build another Iowa, or to request a new design altogether. The Walker Board determined that another coastal battleship design would be <b>imprudent,</b> since the United States had long coastlines and therefore the new ships would need to have better seakeeping qualities than the Indiana or Kearsarge designs.|$|E
500|$|Although Continental Congress President John Hancock praised Hopkins for the fleet's performance, {{its failure}} to capture Glasgow gave opponents of the Navy {{in and out of}} Congress {{opportunities}} for criticism. Nicholas Biddle wrote of the action, [...] "A more <b>imprudent,</b> ill-conducted affair never happened". Abraham Whipple, captain of Columbus, endured rumours and accusations of cowardice for a time, but eventually asked for a court-martial to clear his name. Held on 6 May by a panel consisting of officers who had been on the cruise, he was cleared of cowardice, although he was criticised for errors of judgment. John Hazard, captain of Providence, was not so fortunate. Charged by his subordinate officers with a variety of offences, including neglect of duty during the Glasgow action, he was convicted by court-martial and forced to surrender his commission.|$|E

Ickes stated that Wilbur had been <b>imprudent</b> in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam. Unknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name [...] "Hoover Dam" [...] in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam.

500|$|Ethel Barrymore (born Ethel Mae Blythe; 1879–1959) was an American actress of stage, {{screen and}} radio. She {{came from a}} family of actors; she was the middle child of Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and had two brothers, Lionel and John. Reluctant to pursue her parents' career, the loss of {{financial}} support following the death of Louisa Lane Drew, caused Barrymore to give up her dream of becoming a concert pianist and instead earn a living on the stage. Barrymore's first Broadway role, alongside her uncle John Drew, Jr., was in The <b>Imprudent</b> Young Couple (1895). She soon found success, particularly after an invitation from William Gillette to appear on stage in his 1897 London production of Secret Service. Barrymore was soon popular with English society, and she had a number of romantic suitors, including Laurence Irving, the dramatist. His father, Henry Irving, cast her in The Bells (1897) and Peter the Great (1898).|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Whitrow and BAFTA-nominated Alison Steadman {{were cast}} to play Mr and Mrs Bennet, Elizabeth's {{distinguished}} but financially <b>imprudent</b> and occasionally self-indulgent parents. Steadman {{was offered the}} role without auditions or screen tests. Elizabeth's four sisters, whose ages ranged between 15 and 22, were cast to look dissimilar from each other. Susannah Harker portrayed Elizabeth's beautiful older sister Jane, who desires to only see good in others. Lucy Briers, Polly Maberly, and Julia Sawalha played Elizabeth's younger sisters [...] the plain Mary, the good-natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty, and frivolous and headstrong Lydia. Being 10 years older than 15-year-old Lydia, Julia Sawalha, of Absolutely Fabulous fame, had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests. Joanna David and Tim Wylton appeared as the Gardiners, Elizabeth's maternal aunt and uncle. David Bamber played the sycophantic clergyman, Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet. Lucy Scott portrayed Elizabeth's best friend and Mr Collins's wife, Charlotte Lucas, and David Bark-Jones portrayed Lt. Denny.|$|E

The temporary appointment began July 1, 2012, to expire 30 days after the date the next legislative session began. Governor McDonnell's spokesman congratulated Thorne-Begland on the appointment, stating, [...] "the Governor believes Mr. Thorne-Begland is well-qualified to serve on the bench".

He told the Commons that waiting a year would be <b>imprudent,</b> given the worldwide shortage of steel pipe, and unfair to those who owned natural gas wells in western Canada, which were presently capped. Howe told the House he believed this to be a great project, [...] "of truly national scope, which we must either launch now or see languish for years to come." [...] He completed his address by giving notice that the following day, the Government intended to invoke closure. Social Credit, with many members from Alberta, supported the bill, while the Tories and CCF engaged in weeks of bitter debate and parliamentary wrangling. This culminated on 1 June, dubbed by the Tories [...] "Black Friday", when Speaker René Beaudoin reversed a ruling he had made the previous evening which would have allowed the Opposition to continue the debate past the deadline. The Opposition accused the Speaker of yielding to Government pressure. The bill passed within the deadline, and construction on the pipeline began immediately.

500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, archaeological and {{historical}} research was conducted regarding a potential connection between Carantouan and the structures described on the hill. After surveying the area in spring and fall, archaeologist L.D. Shoemaker discovered evidence of Native American habitation, including shell heaps, corn and flint chips, along with various other implements. In 1918, historian and archaeologist George P. Donehoo, after {{a survey of the}} site, determined that it was impossible for Spanish Hill to have been the site of the town described by Brûlé. He cited the sharp incline, which would have made ascension difficult, as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of Carantouan. Speculation that Spanish Hill was the site of the village was also countered by James Bennett Griffin, who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931. However, historian Deb Twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth-century archaeologist Warren Moorehead, as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area {{may have contributed to the}} lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition. [...] As Twig wrote: “Until more information is known, it seems <b>imprudent</b> to eliminate Spanish Hill as a possible site related to the nation of Carantouan, as some researchers have done.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into ten {{chapters}} which each act as a short story, linked {{by the use of}} {{a group of people who}} appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jāti) are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are [...] "combative, <b>imprudent</b> and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed" [...] and [...] "striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering". The B characters are [...] "more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic" [...] and [...] "survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better". The I characters are [...] "the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving." [...] The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked.|$|E
