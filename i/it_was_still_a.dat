5|$|On 22 May 1799, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, led a large column {{across the}} Rhine at Constance, Stein and Eglisau.

5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one was a more modest version of Osborne. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E
5|$|Porto won {{the inaugural}} José Monteiro da Costa Cup tournament in 1911, {{securing}} its first-ever trophy. Three years later, the club clinched {{the first of}} a total of 30 regional championship titles. In 1922, their regional success expanded to a national level, after victory in the inaugural staging of the Campeonato de Portugal crowned Porto as the first Portuguese champions. The club then won its first Primeira Liga title in 1934–35, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> provisional competition, and again in 1938–39, when it became the official domestic top-tier championship.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} in the local area of occupation since the Iron Age, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> small village until the 19th century when it became a seaside resort, and was connected with local towns and cities by a railway, and two piers were built. The growth continued until {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare Museum, Grand Pier and an aquarium. The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. Cultural venues include The Playhouse, the Winter Gardens and Blakehay Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> major producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> large end-use) {{as more and more}} copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
5|$|The lower river, from Midhurst to its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, {{has been used}} for navigation. Boats used the section from the Arun to Fittleworth following improvements made to the Arun in 1615, and after the Arun Navigation was completed in 1790, the Earl of Egremont made the river navigable up to Midhurst by constructing eight locks and some small cuts. The work was completed in 1794, and many of the bridges built at that time still survive. With the opening of the Mid-Sussex Railway branch to Midhurst in 1859, traffic declined, and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s. Pleasure boats continued to be used on the river for many years, and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920. The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936, after an undergraduate pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> public right of way.|$|E

Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb purchased the division from their employers in December 1989, as Cineplex looked to offload assets. Originally the assistant general manager of The Pantages Theatre, he became its general manager. In 1993, he moved to North York Performing Arts Centre to prepare it for the stage revival of the musical Show Boat. Livent used Toronto as the test site for the original Broadway production of Ragtime; it made it world premiere at North York Centre in 1996, and Bednar was involved in production. As of 1997, Bednar was general manager of The Pantages Theatre. {{and general manager of}} theatre for its parent company, Livent. From 1997 to 1998, {{near the end of his}} time with the company, he spent a year in New York City preparing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts for its opening and that of Ragtime; he had worked on the production previously in Toronto. He was scheduled to oversee the remake of Chicago's Oriental Theatre into the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre.|$|E
