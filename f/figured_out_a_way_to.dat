500|$|In {{the period}} before World War II, The New Yorker {{published}} a vignette in their [...] "The Talk of the Town" [...] feature saying that Einstein was so {{well known in}} America {{that he would be}} stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain [...] "that theory". He finally <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers [...] "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein." ...|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Blackout, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No.33 on the Billboard 200, while its title track peaked at No.21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No.32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks." [...] Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004. He is the fourth person to fill this position.|$|E
500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of X has been well-received by critics. Entertainment Weekly included the {{character in the}} list of the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons in 2009, at number 17. Todd vanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, has praised the [...] "gravitas" [...] of Williams' acting, adding that he wished that the writers [...] "had <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> have him around more often than they did". VanDerWerff's fellow writer Zack Handlen felt that the character's assassination in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was [...] "appropriately shocking", calling the scene [...] "one of the most memorable death's [...] in the series"; although he felt that the immediate introduction of the character's successor, Marita Covarrubias, [...] "deflates the importance of X's loss" [...] in the episode. Handlen has also called X [...] "the best of Mulder's informants", explaining that this is [...] "because he's always pissed off, he's always reluctant to provide information, and you can't ever be sure what play he's really running". Series writer Frank Spotnitz has called X [...] "the meanest, nastiest, most lethal killer on the planet".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Syzygy" [...] an A, describing the episode as [...] "another uproarious send-up, {{this time of}} teen venom, B-movie paranoia, and our agents' painfully restrained rapport", with praise to the villains and the discussion on why Mulder always drives, considered [...] "one of Mulder's and Scully's funniest exchanges". Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave a B-, describing it as [...] "an entertaining hour that never rises {{to the level of}} those other episodes" [...] like [...] "Humbug" [...] and [...] "War of the Coprophages". VanDerWerff argued that [...] "Syzygy" [...] was an attempt by Carter to try and emulate the writing style of Darin Morgan's scripts, without success; he noted [...] "the laughs here are emptier than they were the week before in 'Coprophages'"—and adding that [...] "every time you think the episode has <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> plant its foot firmly in comedic territory, there's a horribly judged moment of 'drama,' like Mulder's final monologue." [...] Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Margi and Terri among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, describing [...] "Syzygy" [...] as a [...] "hilarious send-up of Heathers".|$|E
6000|$|The Democratic Committee <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do this. Monroe County, {{where both}} Forbes and Hopkins resided, {{was one of}} the Democratic strongholds of the State. The {{portions}} of Washington and Jefferson Counties included in the Eighth District were as strongly Republican, and being more populous gave to the district its natural Republican majority. On the same ticket that was to elect a Representative to the State Legislature was the candidate for Sheriff of Monroe County. A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds, the liveryman, the Democratic nominee. Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins. The Democrats would bargain with the Republicans to vote for the Republican Sheriff if the Republicans would vote for the Democratic Representative. This [...] "trading votes," [...] which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate. The only thing necessary was to [...] "fix" [...] Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally. The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year, and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it.|$|E
