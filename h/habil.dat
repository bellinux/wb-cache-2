25|$|Initially twelve volumes were planned, {{but after}} the work began it became evident that {{coverage}} of modern Lithuanian history would require an additional volume. The successive volumes {{will be the same}} size - 25.5cm x 16.5cm. The editorial board of the series consists of the following scholars: <b>habil.</b> dr. Algirdas Girininkas, dr. Artūras Dubonis, prof. dr. Zigmantas Kiaupa, prof. <b>habil.</b> dr. Jūratė Kiaupienė, dr. Česlovas Laurinavičius, dr. Rimantas Miknys, dr. Gintautas Sliesoriūnas, and dr. Gintautas Zabiela. More than 20 scholars are working on this project. Each volume is peer reviewed and has an additional responsible editor. The Lithuanian Institute of History is acting in cooperation with Lithuanian universities, including Vilnius University, increasing scholarly involvement in the project.|$|E

25|$|Several hundred Uighur Muslims {{had been}} {{converted}} to Christianity by the Swedes. Imprisonment and execution were inflicted on Uighur Christian converts and, after refusing {{to give up his}} Christian religion, they executed the convert Uighur <b>Habil</b> in 1933. The East Turkestan Republic banished the Swedish missionaries and tortured and jailed Christian converts, mainly Kirghiz and Uighurs. The openly Islamic East Turkestan Republic forcibly ejected the Swedish missionaries and was openly hostile to Christianity while espousing a Muslim Turkic ideology. The East Turkestan Republic subjected former Muslim Christian converts like Joseph Johannes Khan to jail, torture and abuse after he refused to give up Christianity in favor of Islam. After the British intervened to free Khan he was forced to leave his land and in November 1933 he came to Peshawar.|$|E

His name in Hebrew {{is composed of}} the same three consonants as a root meaning [...] "breath". Julius Wellhausen, and many scholars following him, have proposed that the name is independent of the root. Eberhard Schrader had previously put forward the Akkadian (Old Assyrian dialect) ablu ("son") as a more likely etymology.|$|E

2500|$|After Lithuania regained its {{independence}} from the Soviet union in 1990, a number of academic works were published by prominent historians of the state’s history. These included Edvardas Gudavičius‘ [...] "Lietuvos istorija.

However, {{the majority of these}} were dedicated to specific time frames and did not cover the entire period from prehistory to the modern era. The first proposal to issue a complete history may be credited to professor Antanas Tyla. The suggestion was reinforced by academic Vytautas Merkys. The opportunity to issue a fundamental and comprehensive academic work arose in 2000, when a programme sponsored by the Lithuanian Institute of History, coordinated by prof. <b>habil.</b> dr. Jūratė Kiaupienė, was approved.|$|E
2500|$|The Ph.D. was {{originally}} a degree granted by a university to learned {{individuals who had}} achieved the approval of their peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career {{in the field of}} philosophy (in the broad sense of the term, meaning the pursuit of knowledge). The appellation of [...] "Doctor" [...] (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, knowledge, and the spread of knowledge. The Ph.D. entered widespread use in the 19th century at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. Prior to the formal degree, the contemporary doctorate (PhD), arguably, arose in Leipzig as a successor to the Master's (MA) degree in 1652 (Dr. <b>habil).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cain and Abel ( [...] ; [...] Qayin, Heḇel; Qābīl, <b>Hābīl)</b> were sons of Adam and Eve in {{the biblical}} Book of Genesis. Cain, the firstborn, tilled the soil, and his brother Abel was a shepherd. The {{brothers}} made sacrifices to God, each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain murdered Abel. God punished Cain {{to a life of}} wandering, but set a mark on him so that no man would kill him. Cain then dwelt in the land of Nod ( [...] , [...] "wandering"), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with Enoch. The narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and Abel was the first to die.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#1] The Egyptian word is {{generally}} pronounced “Zaghrutah,” the plural is Zagharit, corrupted to Ziraleet. The classical Arabic term is “Tahlil”; the Persians call the cry “Kil.” It is peculiar to women, and is formed {{by raising the}} voice to its highest pitch, vibrating {{it at the same}} time by rolling the tongue, whose modulations express now joy, now grief. To my ear it always resembled the brain-piercing notes of a fife. Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds. The “unsavoury comparison,” however, may owe its origin to the circumstance that Dr. Buchanan heard it at the orgies of Jagannath. [FN#2] As an Indian is called “Miyan,” sir, an elderly Indian becomes “bara Miyan,” great or ancient sir. I shall have occasion to speak at a future period of these Indians at Meccah. [FN#3] “Sitt al-Kabirah,” or simply “Al-Kabirah,” the Great Lady, is the title given to the mistress of. the house. [FN#4] This hill bounds Meccah on the East. According to many Moslems, Adam, with his wife and his son Seth, lie buried in a cave here. Others place his tomb at Muna; the Majority at Najaf. The early Christians had a tradition that our first parents were interred under Mount Calvary; the Jews place their grave near Hebron. <b>Habil</b> (Abel), it is well known, is supposed to be entombed at Damascus; and Kabil (Cain) rests at last under Jabal Shamsan, the highest wall of the Aden crater, where he and his progeny, tempted by Iblis, erected the first fire-temple. It certainly deserves to be the sepulchre of the first murderer. The worship, however, was probably imported from India, where Agni (the fire god) was, as the Vedas prove, the object of man’s earliest adoration. [FN#5] The popular legend of this gate is, that when Abraham and his son were ordered to rebuild the Ka’abah, they found the spot occupied by an old woman. She consented to remove her house on condition that the key of the new temple should be entrusted to her and to her descendants for ever and ever. The origin of this is, that Benu Shaybah means the “sons of an old woman” as well as “descendants of Shaybah.” And history tells us that the Benu Shaybah are derived from one Shaybah (bin Osman, bin Talhah, bin Shaybah, bin Talhah, bin Abd al-Dar), who was sent by Mu’awiyah to make some alterations in the Ka’abah. According to others, the Ka’abah key was committed to the charge of Osman bin Talhah by the Prophet. [FN#6] The Moslem in circumambulation presents his left shoulder; the Hindu’s Pradakshina consists in walking round with the right side towards the fane or idol. Possibly the former may be a modification of the latter, which would appear to be the original form of the rite. Its conjectural significance is an imitation of the procession of the heavenly bodies, the motions of the spheres, and the dances of the angels. These are also imitated in the circular whirlings of the Darwayshes. And Al-Shahristani informs us that the Arab philosophers believed this sevenfold circumambulation to be symbolical of the motion of the planets round the sun. It was adopted by the Greeks and Romans, whose Ambarvalia and Amburbalia appear to be eastern superstitions, introduced by Numa, or by the priestly line of princes, into their pantheism. And our processions round the parish preserve the form of the ancient rites, whose life is long since fled. Moslem moralists have not failed to draw spiritual food from this mass of materialism. “To circuit the Bayt Ullah,” said the Pir Raukhan (As. Soc. vol. xi. and Dabistan, vol. iii., “Miyan Bayazid”), “and to be free from wickedness, and crime, and quarrels, is the duty enjoined by religion. But to circuit the house of the friend of Allah (i.e. the heart), to combat bodily propensities, and to worship the Angels, is the business of the (mystic) path.” Thus Sa’adi, in his sermons,—which remind the Englishman of “poor Yorick,”—“He who travels to the Ka’abah on foot makes a circuit of the Ka’abah, but he who performs the pilgrimage of the Ka’abah in his heart is encircled by the Ka’abah.” And the greatest Moslem divines sanction this visible representation of an invisible and heavenly shrine, by declaring that, without a material medium, it is impossible for man to worship the Eternal Spirit. [FN#7] The Mutawwif, or Dalil, is the guide at Meccah. [FN#8] In A.D. 1674 some wretch smeared the Black Stone with impurity, and every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard. The Persians, says Burckhardt, were suspected of this sacrilege, and now their ill-fame has spread far; at Alexandria they were described to me as a people who defile the Ka’abah. It is scarcely necessary to say that a Shi’ah, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action with lively horror. The people of Meccah, however, like the Madani, have turned the circumstance to their own advantage, and make an occasional “avanie.” Thus, nine or ten years ago, on the testimony of a boy who swore that he saw the inside of the Ka’abah defiled by a Persian, they rose up, cruelly beat the schismatics, and carried them off to their peculiar quarter the Shamiyah, forbidding their ingress to the Ka’abah. Indeed, till Mohammed Ali’s time, the Persians rarely ventured upon a pilgrimage, and even now that man is happy who gets over it without a beating. The defilement of the Black Stone was probably the work of some Jew or Greek, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry.
