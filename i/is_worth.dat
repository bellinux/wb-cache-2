25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} the tricks won in the hand. There {{are several ways to}} count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick <b>is</b> always <b>worth</b> an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 11, tens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 10, kings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four, queens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> three, jacks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> two, and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of the pieces also makes a significant difference, e.g. pawns near the edges <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less than those near the centre, pawns close to promotion <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> far more, pieces controlling the centre <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> more than average, trapped pieces (such as bad bishops) <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less, etc.|$|R

5|$|The gymnasia have forms which {{operate on}} a unit-credit system, {{that is to say}} a term is divided into course units, each of which <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> a certain number of credits.

5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet plays a crucial role in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead manta <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> $40 to $500 while manta ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single manta ray.

5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{suspects that}} St. Claire's wife Miranda {{was the person}} who ordered her husband's assassination.

Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E
