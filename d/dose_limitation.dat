40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} causes {{cancer and}} non-cancer health effects, {{each of which}} differs greatly {{in the shape of}} the dose–response curve, latency, persistency, recurrence, curability, fatality and impact on quality of life. In recent decades, for <b>dose</b> <b>limitation</b> purposes, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has divided such diverse effects into tissue reactions (formerly termed non-stochastic and deterministic effects) and stochastic effects. On the one hand, effective dose limits aim to reduce the risks of stochastic effects (cancer/heritable effects) and are based on the detriment-adjusted nominal risk coefficients, assuming a linear-non-threshold dose response and a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor of 2. On the other hand, equivalent dose limits aim to avoid tissue reactions (vision-impairing cataracts and cosmetically unacceptable non-cancer skin changes) and are based on a threshold dose. However, the boundary between these two categories is be-coming vague. Thus, we review the changes in radiation effect classification, <b>dose</b> <b>limitation</b> concepts, and the definition of detriment and threshold. Then, the current situation is overviewed focusing on (i) stochastic effects with a threshold, (ii) tissue reactions without a threshold, (iii) target organs/tissues for circulatory disease, (iv) dose levels for limitation of cancer risks vs prevention of non-life-threatening tissue reactions vs prevention of life-threatening tissue reactions, (v) mortality or incidence of thyroid cancer, and (vi) the detri-ment for tissue reactions.

Forty patients (65 %) were administered concurrent chemotherapy. Pre- and post-radiation chemotherapy were given to 61 patients and 43 patients, respectively. The radiation dose was 45 - 50. 4 Gy in 25 - 28 fractions. Clinical parameters, including gender, age, hepatic B virus status, concurrent chemotherapy, and {{the total number of}} chemotherapy cycles, were included in the analysis. Univariate analyses with a non-parametric rank test (Mann-Whitney test) and logistic regression test and a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression test were completed. We also analysed the correlation between RT and the changes in serum chemistry parameters [including total bilirubin, (TB), direct bilirubin (D-TB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum albumin (ALB) ] after RT. The Child-Pugh grade progressed from grade A to grade B after radiotherapy in 10 patients.

Supplementation with oral or intravenous (IV) iron is a common practice in this popula-tion. Oral iron therapy is limited by poor gastrointestinal absorption, frequent adverse events and low adherence to treatment. Therefore, IV iron is the preferred method of iron replacement in these patients [3]. Nevertheless, high iron doses can lead to serious adverse consequences such as exacerbation of oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, immune deficiency and increased tissue iron stores [4, 5]. There are also other concerns about currently available IV iron agents, including the potential for immunogenic reaction, <b>dose</b> <b>limitations</b> and the require-ment of a test dose, and the desired rate of repletion [6 - 8].

40|$|Abstract Background Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} (SNHL) {{is one of}} the major long term side effects from {{radiation}} therapy (RT) in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. This study aims to review the incidences of SNHL when treating with different radiation techniques. The additional objective is to determine the relationship of the SNHL with the radiation doses delivered to the inner ear. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 134 individual ears from 68 NPC patients, treated with conventional RT and IMRT in combination with chemotherapy from 2004 - 2008 was performed. Dosimetric data of the cochlea were analyzed. Significant SNHL was defined as > 15 dB increase in bone conduction threshold at 4 kHz and PTA (pure tone average of 0. 5, 1, 2 kHz). Relative risk (RR) was used to determine the associated factors with the hearing threshold changes at 4 kHz and PTA. Results Median audiological follow up time was 14 months. The incidence of high frequency (4 kHz) SNHL was 44 % for the whole group (48. 75 % in the conventional RT, 37 % with IMRT). Internal auditory canal mean dose of > 50 Gy had shown a trend to increase the risk of high frequency SNHL (RR 2. 02 with 95 % CI 1. 01 - 4. 03, p = 0. 047).

Thirty-one donors (45 %) were unrelated. The first cohort of 29 had ATG (Thymoglobulin 2 mg/kg x 3 days), the subsequent 26 had Campath 30 mg x 3 days subcutaneously, and the final cohort of 14 had 30 mg Campath once. The groups were similar as regards age, diagnosis and risk factors. Campath-patients had no acute toxicity, fewer days with fever and antibiotics, and required fewer transfusions than ATG-treated patients. 3 -d-Campath patients showed lower lymphocyte counts from day + 4, and CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 19 + and NK cells recovered slower than in ATG-treated patients.

Sustained hematopoiesis after double UCBT usually is derived from a single donor unit, as only a few patients {{have been reported to}} display stable mixed-unit chimerism for varying periods of time. Explanations for the 1 unit dominance, predictors for identifying unit superiority, and persistence of long-term mixed-unit chimerism remain elusive. Review of published literature revealed only 11 of 280 patients (4 %) with mixed-unit chimerism for at least 1  year after transplantation, with 3 patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Mixed-unit chimerism was more likely if both units were closely HLA matched to each other. Outcome data for patients with stable mixed-unit chimerism, for the most part, were scarcely reported. Analysis of the small sample size revealed a potential advantage of stable mixed-unit chimerism on enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect; however, definitive conclusions cannot be made on the effect of mixed-unit chimerism on the rates of graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, gathering outcome data prospectively in larger clinical series will help answer the question of whether stable mixed-unit chimerism is either beneficial and, therefore, should be strived for, detrimental and, thus, needs to be eliminated, or if it is of no clinical consequence...|$|E
40|$|About {{one third}} of lung cancers {{initially}} present with a localised disease, without any curative surgery potential, because of local spread or comorbidity. Definitive radiation, alone or combined with chemotherapy, then represents the treatment of choice for these patients. The results, however, are disappointing, with a biopsy-proven local control of 10 % at two years and a 5 - 10 % five-year survival rate. These poor results may be partially explained by the difficulties in delineating the tumour volume {{as well as the}} dose limitations due to poor tolerance of surrounding normal organs. Lung parenchyma sequelae remain daily worrying events for the oncologist. The advent of 3 D conformal radiation therapy (3 DRT) allows progress and innovations, including the use of modern imaging techniques, sophisticated dosimetry and treatment planning, efficient immobilisation devices and on- line verification procedures. With more precise (and time-consuming) procedures, 3 DRT will allow a better tumour volume delineation, an increased tumour dose and a <b>dose</b> <b>limitation</b> in normal tissues. These improvements may help increase local control and survival results. 3 DRT, which has been used for several years for prostate cancer and benefits from recent imaging improvements, will now allow treatment of other locations, such as lung cancer, with conformal therapy.

Its enormous political, economic, social and psychological impact was mainly due to deeply rooted fear of radiation induced by the linear nonthreshold hypothesis (LNT) assumption. It was a historic event that provided invaluable lessons for nuclear industry and risk philosophy. One of them is demonstration that counted per electricity units produced, early Chernobyl fatalities amounted to 0. 86 death/GWeyear), and they were 47 times lower than from hydroelectric stations (~ 40 deaths/GWeyear). The accident demonstrated that using the LNT assumption as a basis for protection measures and radiation <b>dose</b> <b>limitations</b> was counterproductive, and lead to sufferings and pauperization of millions of inhabitants of contaminated areas. The projections of thousands of late cancer deaths based on LNT, are in conflict with observations that in comparison with general population of Russia, a 15 % to 30 % deficit of solid cancer mortality was found among the Russian emergency workers, and a 5 % deficit solid cancer incidence among the population of most contaminated areas...|$|R
40|$|Insulin-based regimens {{decrease}} {{morbidity and}} mortality among critically ill patients by way of keeping glucose at tight control. Utilizing these regimens involves multiple measurements of glucose by way of finger pricking or through indwelling vascular catheters in order to adjust insulin <b>doses.</b> The <b>limitations</b> and risks of these methods of glucose monitoring are related to potential erroneous measurements, increased risk of infection, and a significant excess workload. An automated blood glucose monitoring device for glucose monitoring of critically ill patients is needed to improve patient care while avoiding the disadvantages of currently used glucose monitoring methodologies...|$|R
