500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Benjamin Turner from GameSpy {{was impressed by}} the translation of [...] "Hikari" [...] into English, and felt Utada's vocals were a good addition to the opening and ending segments of the game. Michael Pascua from BlogCritics.org was generally positive, stating in a detail review; [...] "Utada made a smart decision with the physical release of the CD: she included the songs “Simple and Clean” and “Sanctuary” from the Kingdom Hearts series. Both songs showcase a strong musical style that isn’t necessarily in the R flare that This is the One provides. They also help connect any video game player who hasn’t necessarily listened to any of her Japanese albums or even <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> another English album." [...] He also labelled the song and [...] "Sanctuary" [...] "happy additions" [...] to This Is The One.|$|E

6000|$|Again Miss Merry pouted, {{and looked}} down, and plucked the grass, and shrugged her shoulders. No. <b>She</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had.</b> <b>She</b> {{was pretty sure}} she hadn't. Quite sure, she might say. She 'didn't mind it.' ...|$|R

500|$|Not {{willing to}} let public {{sentiment}} over the executions subside, Dyer <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{to go through with}} her martyrdom. [...] After the winter she returned to the Bay Colony in May 1660, and was immediately arrested. On the 31st of the month she was brought before Endecott, who questioned her briefly, and then pronounced her execution for the following day. [...] On 1 June, Dyer was once again led to the gallows, and while standing at the hanging tree for the final time, Wilson, who had received her into the Boston church 24 years earlier and had baptized her son Samuel, called to her. [...] His words were, [...] "Mary Dyer, O repent, O repent, and be not so deluded and carried away by deceit of the devil." [...] Her reply was, [...] "Nay, man, I am not now to repent." [...] With these final words, the ladder was kicked away, and she died when her neck snapped.|$|E
500|$|In {{his article}} for MuuMuse, Bradley Stern {{believed}} Utada's vocals and production [...] "brings the track to another level, transcending the patterns {{and limitations of}} most modern pop". Stern also valued the Japanese version as a [...] "defining moment" [...] to her artistic craft. [...] Furthermore, an editor of Square Enix Music rated it {{nine out of ten}} points, commending the production and sound; he/she labelled it to be a [...] "masterpiece". Blogcritics' Michael Pascua appreciated Utada's move to add [...] "Sanctuary" [...] as the final track to This Is The One, exclaiming [...] " [...] showcases a strong musical style that isn’t necessarily in the R flare that This is the One provides. They also help connect any video game player who hasn't necessarily listened to any of her Japanese albums or even <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> another English album..." [...] Céire Ní Dalaigh from The Arcade also commented that [...] "This track builds from the very beginning making it the perfect tune for any occasion. Whether it just be walking to work, building the pace at the gym or even just chilling out at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{ambiguous}} {{terms are}} interpreted {{in favor of}} finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. [...] "For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage ... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a [...] "mixed" [...] action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling {{does not apply to}} the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable. AIG plans to appeal this ruling.|$|E

2500|$|Arlena was unsuspecting, but if Kenneth <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> nearly {{emptied the}} account, {{he would become}} {{suspicious}} and Patrick would find himself in a difficult predicament. So Patrick and Christine decided {{to get rid of}} her. Arlena went on that fatal day to meet Patrick, as Poirot had surmised. Patrick instructed her to remain hidden in the cave if anyone came around. Meanwhile, Christine set Linda's watch 20 minutes forward. When she asked Linda to check the time, her alibi was set. Later, she adjusted the watch back. went to her room, applied suntan makeup and (wearing large-sleeved clothes to hide her fake tan) sneaked out of the hotel to Pixy Cove and pretended to be the supposedly dead Arlena. Emily, who, with Patrick, [...] "found" [...] her was easily fooled. Christine then returned to her hotel room and took a bath to wash off the tan; the bath that everyone denied taking. She then threw the empty makeup bottle out a window, which nearly hit Miss Brewster. Meanwhile, Patrick called an unsuspecting Arlena out of the cave and strangled her. Poirot needles Patrick into a near violent fury despite the cold-blooded Christine telling him to [...] "be quiet".|$|E
2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999."The real question to me is: How could she have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he never <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could {{have been found in}} medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E
