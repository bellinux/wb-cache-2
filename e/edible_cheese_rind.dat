40|$|St. Nectaire {{cheese is}} a semisoft cheese of French origin that, along with Brie and Camembert cheeses, {{belongs to the}} class of surface mold-ripened cheese. The surface {{microorganisms}} that develop on the <b>cheese</b> <b>rind</b> during ripening impart a distinctive aroma and flavor to this class of cheese. We have documented the sequential appearance of microorganisms on the <b>cheese</b> <b>rind</b> and in the curd over a 60 -day ripening period. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the development of surface fungi and bacteria. Light microscopy of stained paraffin sections was used to study cross sections through the rind. We also monitored the development of bacterial and yeast populations in and the pH of the curd and rind. The earliest stage of ripening (0 to 2 days) {{is dominated by the}} lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus cremoris and multilateral budding yeasts, primarily Debaryomyces and Torulopsis species. Geotrichum candidum follows closely, and then zygomycetes of the genus Mucor develop at day 4 of ripening. At day 20, the deuteromycete Trichothecium roseum appears.

40|$|SummaryTractable {{microbial}} {{communities are}} needed {{to bridge the gap}} between observations of patterns of microbial diversity and mechanisms that can explain these patterns. We developed <b>cheese</b> <b>rinds</b> as model microbial communities by characterizing in situ patterns of diversity and by developing an in vitro system for community reconstruction. Sequencing of 137 different rind communities across 10 countries revealed 24 widely distributed and culturable genera of bacteria and fungi as dominant community members. Reproducible community types formed independent of geographic location of production. Intensive temporal sampling demonstrated that assembly of these communities is highly reproducible. Patterns of community composition and succession observed in situ can be recapitulated in a simple in vitro system. Widespread positive and negative interactions were identified between bacterial and fungal community members. <b>Cheese</b> <b>rind</b> microbial communities represent an experimentally tractable system for defining mechanisms that influence microbial community assembly and function.

40|$|Many metagenomic {{sequencing}} {{studies have}} observed {{the presence of}} closely related bacterial species or genotypes in the same microbiome. Previous attempts to explain these patterns of microdiversity {{have focused on the}} abiotic environment, but few have considered how biotic interactions could drive patterns of microbiome diversity. We dissected the patterns, processes, and mechanisms shaping the ecological distributions of three closely related Staphylococcus species in <b>cheese</b> <b>rind</b> biofilms. Paradoxically, the most abundant species (S.  equorum) is the slowest colonizer and weakest competitor based on growth and competition assays in the laboratory. Through in vitro community reconstructions, we determined that biotic interactions with neighboring fungi help resolve this paradox. Species-specific stimulation of the poor competitor by fungi of the genus Scopulariopsis allows S.  equorum to dominate communities in vitro as it does in situ. Results of comparative genomic and transcriptomic experiments indicate that iron utilization pathways, including a homolog of the S.  aureus staphyloferrin B siderophore operon pathway, are potential molecular mechanisms underlying Staphylococcus-Scopulariopsis interactions. Our integrated approach demonstrates that fungi can structure the ecological distributions of closely related bacterial species, and the data highlight the importance of bacterium-fungus interactions in attempts to design and manipulate microbiomes...|$|R

40|$|Fatty acids are {{important}} as constituents of cheese flavour. In cheese made from raw milk, milk lipase probably hydrolyses cheese fat to some extent, but cheese made from aseptically drawn milk shows no piquant flavour. It was established that during ripening no active lipase was formed inside the cheese. Enzymes of isolated strains of Lactobacillus and Micrococcus, genera normally found in ripened cheese, failed to hydrolyse fat to a measurable extent in normal conditions for hard cheese. Bacteria from the genera Pseudomonas Achromobacter, Alcaligenes and Serratia, {{belonging to the}} normal flora of milk, caused considerable fat hydrolysis in cheese, although these bacteria did not grow in cheese, and died within a few days. Micro-organisms growing {{on the surface of}} hard cheese could hydrolyse the fat of the <b>cheese</b> <b>rind.</b> As the fat-splitting bacteria are killed by pasteurization of the milk, cheese from pasteurized milk shows no piquant flavour. Addition of suitable amounts of cultures of fat-hydrolysing bacteria to pasteurized milk improved the cheese flavour.

40|$|Molecular {{fingerprinting}} {{of bacterial}} ecosystems has recently increased in food microbiology. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to develop a}} rapid and easy method to extract DNA from various cheeses, and to optimize the separation of low and high GC-content bacteria by PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE). Seventy six strains belonging to 50 of the most frequently encountered bacterial species in dairy products were used to construct a database. Specific PCR-TTGE ladders containing 17 species forming a regular scale were created. Amplicons of these species were sequenced and the GCcontent plotted against the migration distance: the correlation coefficients obtained were r 2 = 0. 97 and r 2 = 0. 99, respectively for high and low GCcontents. The extraction method developed did not use any harmful solvent such as phenol/chloroform. The concentrations of DNA extracted from hard cooked and pressed cheeses, quantified by picogreen molecular probes, were between 0. 7 and 6 μg/g for core samples and 8 to 30 μg/g for rind samples. Experimental as well as commercial dairy products were analysed using the developed method and the reproducibility of the profiles was 89 %.

40|$|Curd granule {{junction}} {{patterns in}} hard (Emmentaler, Gruyere, Sbrinz) and semi-hard cheeses (Appenzeller, Tilsiter, Raclette) were visualized on slices and examined using light microscopy and digital image analysis. Horizontal and vertical sections were cut in different zones of the loaves, {{in order to}} obtain information on the orientation of the flattened curd granules. The frequency histograms of the cross section areas could in most cases adequately be described as a log-normal distribution. The median values ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 15 mm 2 and, from 1. 31 to 1. 68 mm 2 for hard and semi-hard cheeses, respectively. An elliptical form factor was used as a measure of the deformation of the granules. The average ratio of the elliptical axes was in the range of 0. 41 to 0. 56 in horizontal and 0. 33 to 0. 48 i n vertical sections. The difference between the form factors in the orthogonal sections was less pronounced in the Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses than in the other varieties. Significantly different junction patterns were observed in regions of the edges and sides of the original billets of curd. The micrographs reveal ed interesting features around the eyes and in the <b>cheese</b> <b>rind.</b> Semi-mechanized and traditionally manufactured Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses had different curd granule junction patterns, mainly because of different moulding and pressing arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{contamination}} in Ricotta salata <b>cheese</b> <b>rind</b> {{is a common}} finding. In the last year numerous cases of food alert and even of human listeriosis associated with the consume of Ricotta salata {{have been reported in}} different Member States of the European Union and other countries. The presence of L. monocytogenes in the cheese making plant environment represent an important risk factor in the contamination of ricotta salata (i. e. post-proces contamination). L. monocytogenes is mainly localized on the rind of the product. The reduction of the risk associated with environmental contamination can be obtained through the application of post-lethality treatment. The feasibility to inactivate L. monocytogenes using water bath heat-treatment under experimental conditions has already been demonstrated by Spanu et al., (2013). The aim of this work was to optimize a water bath heat treatment, which can be used at industrial level, allowing the control of L. monocytogenes post-process {{contamination in}} Ricotta salata wheels and wedges. For each type of product was tested the efficacy of 9 time-temperature combinations on samples artificially inoculated with L. monocytogenes. On the test units were conducted microbiological, physic-chemical and sensorial analysis.

40|$|The {{microbial}} {{composition and}} its {{spatial distribution of}} Grana Trentino, a hard Parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. After cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the <b>cheese</b> <b>rind,</b> an intermediate section and the cheese core. After two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. Milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic bacterial counts. Thermophilic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus) were found in high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. After 9 months of ripening, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts were higher than those after 18 months. Furthermore, the LAB numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. The main LAB species isolated from milk (Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Streptococcus uberis and Lactococcus garvieae) were {{not found in the}} corresponding cheeses. Some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. Microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of LAB.
