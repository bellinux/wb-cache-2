The impecuniosity of the plaintiff, the court asserted, is merely a fact to be considered together with all other facts.

5000|$|The {{question}} as to the reasonable foreseeability of the damages cannot, the court held, {{be regarded as the}} single decisive criterion in determining liability. Reasonable foreseeability can indeed be used as a subsidiary test in the application of the flexible criterion, but it cannot displace it. The importance and efficacy of the predominating criterion in resolving questions of legal causality lies in its flexibility. Any attempt to detract from its flexibility should be resisted. Comparisons between {{the facts of the case}} which has to be resolved and the facts of other cases in which a solution has already been found, or which might hypothetically arise, can obviously be useful and of value, and sometimes even decisive, but one should be careful not to attempt to distill fixed or <b>generally</b> <b>applicable</b> <b>rules</b> or principles from the process of comparison. The argument that the plaintiff's claim should [...] "in principle" [...] be rejected was misplaced. There is only one principle: In order to determine whether or not the plaintiff's damages were too remote from the defendant's act to hold the defendant liable, considerations of policy, reasonableness, fairness and justice should be applied to the particular facts of thecase.|$|E

Not only may the state not respond to some facts about private parties, sometimes it must actively combat them. So the structure raises questions about state action and legal rights. Herzog uses the structure to show that, despite conventional wisdom, state action is about responsibility, not causation. He then turns to legal rights and shows that neither purpose nor effects tests can explain the turns the law takes in these cases; instead, Herzog develops a new conception, that of the overextended rule...|$|R

This paper further develops the monadic programming paradigm by investigating the extent to which monadic computations can be optimised by using generalisations of short cut fusion to eliminate monadic structures whose sole purpose is to “glue together ” monadic program components. We make several contributions. First, we show that every inductive type has an associated build combinator and an associated short cut fusion rule. Second, we introduce the notion of an inductive monad to describe those monads that give rise to inductive types, and we give examples of such monads which are widely used in functional programming. Third, we generalise the standard augment combinators and cata/augment fusion rules for algebraic data types to types induced by inductive monads. This allows us to give the first cata/augment rules for some common data types, such as rose trees. Fourth, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our generalisations by providing Haskell implementations for all concepts and examples in the paper. Finally, we offer deep theoretical insights by showing that the augment combinators are monadic in nature, and thus that our cata/build and cata/augment rules are arguably the best <b>generally</b> <b>applicable</b> fusion <b>rules</b> obtainable...|$|R
40|$|Monads {{are commonplace}} {{programming}} devices {{that are used}} to uniformly structure computations; in particular, they are often used to mimic the effects of impure features such as state, error handling, and I/O. This paper further develops the monadic programming paradigm by investigating the extent to which monadic computations can be optimised by using generalisations of short cut fusion to eliminate monadic structures whose sole purpose is to “glue together” monadic program components. Ghani, Uustalu, and Vene have recently shown that every inductive type has an associated build combinator and an associated short cut fusion rule. They have also used the notion of a parameterised monad to describe those monads that give rise to inductive types, and have shown that the standard augment combinators and cata/augment fusion rules for algebraic data types can be generalised to fixed points of all parameterised monads. We revisit these augment combinators and generalised short cut fusion rules for such types but consider them from a functional programming perspective, rather than a categorical one. In addition to making the category-theoretic ideas of Ghani, Uustalu, and Vene more easily accessible to a wider audience of functional programmers, we demonstrate their practical applicability by developing nontrivial application programs and performing modest benchmarking on them. We also show how the cata/augment rules can {{serve as the basis for}} deriving additional generic fusion laws, thus opening the way for an algebra of fusion.
