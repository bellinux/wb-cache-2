5|$|Based on the {{information}} his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton believed his team <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses {{who were willing to}} speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter, and—with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation—filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{once was}} {{credited}} with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese, largely {{on the basis of}} his surviving documents dealing with this, known as the Liber Antiquus. Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed. Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education. The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> live on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E

They probably <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> arrest him right now, probably <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prosecute him, but you always want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case". Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000.|$|R
25|$|After a bitterly fought {{political}} contest, St. Joseph {{was named}} the seat of Berrien County in 1894, when Berrien Springs relinquished that status. The three largest towns in the county, Benton Harbor, St. Joseph, and Niles, each {{wanted to be the}} county seat, but none had a majority vote. Once St. Joseph and Benton Harbor voters combined their votes, St. Joseph <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{dominated}} top-seeded Washington, using a big spurt late in {{the first}} half and then cruising from there. After an evenly matched sixteen minutes that saw Washington lead 30-29, Louisville went on an 18-5 run to close the first half, with the big shots coming from Francisco García, who nailed two three-pointers during that stretch to extend the lead. Washington tried a second-half comeback, cutting Louisville's lead to 67-61 with 8:41 left, but Louisville <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> pull away.|$|E
25|$|During his mayoralty, Sanders {{called himself}} a socialist {{and was so}} {{described}} in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party City Councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the first {{city in the country}} to fund community-trust housing.|$|E

25|$|In , {{the year}} they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and {{the year of the}} AFL–NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to {{equalize}} the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. The Steelers also received a $3 million ($ million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build a true contending team.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Vickers won the Carfax 400 {{from the}} pole {{for his second}} career Sprint Cup victory, Red Bull's first victory, and Toyota's first victory at Michigan. He did so after a late race gamble of not coming in to pit during the race's final caution. On the final restart, Vickers was first and Jimmie Johnson was second. With a little over forty laps to go, Vickers stayed behind Johnson most of the time; trying to save fuel. With just over three laps to go, Johnson ran out of fuel, while Vickers barely <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> claim the win. This victory {{was also the first}} one for Red Bull Racing and the first for Red Bull's {{sponsorship}} in NASCAR.|$|E
500|$|Kent Hughes {{took to the}} Chairman {{role with}} gusto, {{although}} his relationship with Brundage was never cordial. During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes {{was quoted as saying}} that he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> worry about without having [...] "Chicago blow-ins come out here and blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general." ...|$|E

500|$|Sudirman {{was raised}} {{with stories of}} heroic deeds and taught the {{etiquette}} and ways of the priyayi, or noble caste, {{as well as the}} work ethic and simplicity of the wong cilik, or commoners. For his religious education, he studied Islam under Kyai Hajji Qahar with his brother; Sudirman was a religious child, and always prayed on time. He was soon entrusted with performing both the adhan and iqama, or calls to prayer. When he was seven years old, Sudirman was enrolled at a school for natives (...) , where he was an average student. The family, although it <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> live by, was not rich. During his tenure as sub-district head, Cokrosunaryo had not accumulated much wealth, and in Cilacap he became a distributor of Singer sewing machines.|$|E
500|$|Định took {{advantage}} of his improved socio-economic status to recruit a group of impoverished people, whom he organised for clearing land and founding a đồn điền ("military colony") in Gò Công. This occurred after Emperor Tự Đức's 1854 order, which granted General Nguyễn Tri Phương permission to organise southern levies in this manner. In recognition of his achievements, the mandarin authorities gave Định the rank of deputy regimental commander. His success in developing đồn điền was attributed to his organisational ability {{as well as a}} genuine concern for the welfare of those under his protection, ensuring that they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> eat and something to wear. He was regarded as energetic, brave and compassionate. In gratitude for Định's land development skills, the peasants gave him the middle name Công, which means [...] "great public service".|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kombayi, an MDC {{politician}} {{and member of}} the Zimbabwean Senate, said after Smith's death that Zimbabweans had much to thank him for. [...] "The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith," [...] he said. [...] "All the infrastructure is Smith's. We never suffered the way we are suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> eat. When he left power the [...] pound was {{on a par with the}} Zimbabwean dollar, but President Mugabe has killed all that." [...] David Coltart, another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith's death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be [...] "disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister"; Coltart considered Smith's policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe's rise to power and thereby [...] "directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today". Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as [...] "draconian"; he also pointed out that these [...] "levers of repression" [...] had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did. Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with Heidi Holland, saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he [...] "absolutely had to choose"; Smith was, in his opinion, [...] "a bigoted, stupid man" [...] responsible for all of Zimbabwe's problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "sold {{down the}} river" [...] originated as a lament of eastern slaves being split {{apart from their}} families in sales to Louisville. Slave traders collected slaves there until they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ship in a group via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers down to the slave market in New Orleans. There slaves were sold again to owners of cotton and sugar cane plantations.|$|E
2500|$|Roland Gwynne, later {{mayor of}} Eastbourne (1929–1931) and lover of {{suspected}} serial killer John Bodkin Adams, received a feather from a relative.

The writer Compton Mackenzie, then a serving soldier, complained about {{the activities of the}} Order of the White Feather.

2500|$|The Seal of Saint Joseph's University signifies {{its history}} and values. Other Jesuit {{educational}} institutions share three of these symbols. The wolves over a kettle pot show the generosity of the Loyola family towards the poor.

IHS are the first three letters {{of the name of}} Jesus in Greek, and the historic monogram of the Society of Jesus. [...] The stripes signify the 7 sons of the House of Loyola, who died defending their home. The lily is the distinguishing symbol of the university, honoring Saint Joseph, the school's patron saint. The seal is the graphical representation of Saint Joseph's and its uniquely Jesuit identity.|$|E

2500|$|On May 2, 2006, Donnelly {{defeated}} Steve Francis for the Democratic nomination, {{setting up}} a rematch against Chris Chocola. Because Chocola was {{a strong supporter of}} George W.

The website Moveon.org identified Donnelly as a top contender to defeat a Republican incumbent in the house, and began running its [...] "Red-Handed" [...] ads against Chocola early in the campaign. Chocola still maintained a significant money advantage over Donnelly, but in 2006, Donnelly <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> maintain a competitive advertising presence throughout the campaign. The campaign was heated, with the DCCC sponsoring ads attacking Chocola as being beholden to moneyed interests in the insurance, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. Chocola returned fire by attacking Donnelly over a late tax filing and by attempting to link him to liberal House leader Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
2500|$|... {{maintained}} {{station at}} the front of the peloton, with Contador being paced by three of his team-mates, and his rivals Rodríguez and Valverde were in close order to him. With the pace being accelerated, the peloton was being reduced in numbers, with only the race contenders remaining after a time. Froome cracked on the climb at one point, but managed to recover sufficiently to rejoin the leaders' group – having caught and passed Losada – before eventually falling off the back again, eventually losing 50 seconds, falling to 1' 41 behind, after time bonuses were applied. Contador launched an attack with [...] to go, and nobody followed immediately; however, Rodríguez eventually set off in pursuit of Contador, catching him with around a kilometre remaining. Contador made one last bid for victory, but Rodríguez <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> combat the move, and eventually accelerated away from him and won his third stage of the race, gapping Contador by five seconds, and added nine seconds to his overall lead.|$|E
