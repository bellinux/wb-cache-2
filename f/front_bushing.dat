40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{path planning}} strategies for multiple robots to cooperate to extinguish a many <b>fronted</b> <b>bush</b> fire where {{the need to}} deliver adequate water to each fire front and for each vehicle to carry a limited supply of water is taken into account, as {{is the time to}} extinguish each fire front, whose ferocity is proportional to the quantity of water required (estimated) to extinguish it. Both minimal total path length and minimal overall time solutions are sought. The number of robots available, their water carrying capacities and their speeds are specified, as is the number, locations and severity of fire fronts distributed over a known environment with obstacles. ...|$|R

50|$|During 1971 {{the spring}} rates and damper {{settings}} were altered {{along with the}} <b>front</b> suspension <b>bushes</b> which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low speed ride harshness which had generated press criticism {{at the time of}} the Cortina Mark III's launch.|$|R
5000|$|For the Weissach axle, the <b>front</b> pivot <b>bushing</b> of the {{trailing}} arm {{is replaced by}} a short link. In this arrangement, when the vehicle decelerates and the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] back, the result is toe in. This adds to stability and thus, reduces oversteer.|$|R
60|$|The {{houses were}} uniform, all exactly the same. Like little green shells, rows of them, several hundred. There {{was a little}} lawn in front of each. Lawn, a path, a <b>front</b> porch, <b>bushes</b> in a meager row around each house. But the houses were all alike and very small.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} a 1930 or 1931 General Motors taxi {{operated}} by Black and White Cab Company, ca. 1931. The lightly-colored cab is visible at center, parked in <b>front</b> of <b>bushes</b> that appear {{to belong to a}} residence. The top of the cab is darkly-colored. The numbers " 533 " and "Mutual 1234 " are etched along the side panels...|$|R
50|$|This colonial saltbox {{house is}} sited {{on a large}} lot at the rural western edge of Middletown. Screened from the <b>front</b> by <b>bushes,</b> trees, and a stone wall, and on the east by a cedar paling fence, the house is very secluded. A two-story gambrel-roofed wing on the west, a two car garage on the north, and a large nineteenth century barn south of the house {{complete}} the estate.|$|R
25|$|Barnard {{became aware}} of Goodwin's {{description}} of NESARA {{before his death in}} 2005. He denied that NESARA had been enacted into law or even assigned a tracking number, and condemned Goodwin's allegations as a disinformation campaign.

2500|$|Whether or not {{the number}} of songs {{circulated}} from Tin Pan Alley between 1939 and 1945 was greater than during the First World War is still debated. In his book The Songs That Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home <b>Front,</b> John <b>Bush</b> Jones cites Jeffrey C. Livingstone as claiming that Tin Pan Alley released more songs during World War I {{than it did in}} World War II. Jones, on the other hand, argues that [...] "there is also strong documentary evidence that the output of American war-related songs during World War II was most probably unsurpassed in any other war." ...|$|R
50|$|The stadium's sight {{lines have}} always been very good. The field is {{approximately}} four feet below the stands, and the rise to the stands is very steep. The end zone is only 20 feet from the field, and the sideline seats are only 50 feet from the field. However, several seats {{in the corners of}} the north and south stands are directly in <b>front</b> of <b>bushes,</b> making it difficult to see the field. Also, the last row of the lower level grandstand seats has a fairly significant overhang problem; people sitting in this area can't see the scoreboards or video boards.|$|R
50|$|After the {{untimely}} break-up of the Misunderstood in London in 1967, Campbell reformed {{the band}} with all new members including former <b>Bush</b> <b>front</b> man, Steve Hoard, on lead vocals. At this point {{they were no}} longer playing psychedelic rock, opting for Pop and blues rock. They recorded two singles for Fontana Records before Hoard left and the group split.|$|R
5000|$|However, the Soros Foundations {{have also}} {{supported}} similar [...] "regime change" [...] in U.S.-backed countries, and Soros heavily invested in defeating George W. Bush in 2004. The view that Soros is {{acting as a}} <b>front</b> for the <b>Bush</b> administration is not supported by mainstream opinion. Again, no significant evidence {{has been found to}} support these claims.|$|R
5000|$|Fantastic Damage is {{the first}} proper {{full-length}} solo album by New York rapper and producer El-P, released on his own Definitive Jux label on May 14, 2002. The tracks [...] "Fantastic Damage", [...] "Deep Space 9mm", and [...] "The Nang, the <b>Front,</b> the <b>Bush</b> and the Shit" [...] were featured in the El-P-scored graffiti film Bomb the System. An instrumental version of the album, Fandam Plus: Instrumentals, Remixes, Lyrics & Video, was released on 1 October 2002. This double disc release included all the instrumentals of Fantastic Damage on its first disc and three remixes, the Fantastic Damage lyrics, and video footage on its second disc.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Texas Chainsaw Management" [...] (2007) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. {{argues that}} [...] "The verdict on George W. Bush as the nation's {{environmental}} steward {{has already been}} written in stone. No president has mounted a more sustained and deliberate assault on the nation's environment. No president has acted with more solicitude toward polluting industries. Assaulting the environment across a broad <b>front,</b> the <b>Bush</b> administration has promoted and implemented more than 400 measures that eviscerate 30 years of environmental policy." [...] Kennedy has also written a book Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy.|$|R

A footpath leads from the drive to the house and is crossed by another path which goes around the house. The house itself has two round turrets in <b>front.</b> Trees and <b>bushes</b> are planted at intervals in the lawn...|$|R
50|$|In Australia, the {{prevalence}} of eucalyptus trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame <b>front.</b> Hence the <b>bush</b> fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire. Sometimes, emission of combustible gases from swamps (e.g., methane) has a similar effect. For instance, methane explosions enforced the Peshtigo Fire.|$|R
25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with <b>front</b> hydraulic <b>bushing</b> and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|R

5000|$|The HT Monaro can be {{distinguished}} from the HK by the adoption of plastic grilles (previously metal), a round speedometer instead of [...] "strip" [...] style allowing for bringing the tachometer into the main instrument cluster {{instead of on the}} floor console, rubber <b>front</b> suspension <b>bushes</b> instead of the HK's sintered bronze, and larger taillights where the turn indicators also wrapped around the now slightly undercut edges. Bodywork 'go-faster' stripe designs (delete options) varied for each series; HK stripes were offset to the driver's side of the bonnet (hood) and bootlid (trunk), the HT had two broad stripes down the centre of the car. HT also had twin air scoops / vents incorporated into their bonnet, which served no real purpose in delivering air into the engine bay.|$|R

60|$|In Spanish towns a merchant's office {{generally}} {{occupies the}} ground floor of his house, and Kit liked Jefferson's. The narrow street was very hot, and the reflections from the white walls hurt his eyes. To enter the tunnel, guarded by a fine iron gate, and cross the shady patio was a relief. In the middle, a little fountain splashed, the walls were lemon-yellow and a splendid purple bougainvillea trailed about the pillars that carried a balcony. The dark spaces behind the posts looked like cloisters. In <b>front</b> big heliotrope <b>bushes</b> occupied green tubs.|$|R

50|$|Following the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in November 1988, the PLO officially {{recognized}} Israel, and an {{open dialogue}} began between the PLO and the U.S. government. The Palestine Information Office now changed its title to Palestine Affairs Center. The dialogue continued also during {{the early months of}} President George H. W. Bush. The U.S.-PLO dialogue was suspended in June 1990, following PLO refusal to condemn an attempted attack on the Israeli coastline by the Palestine Liberation <b>Front.</b> The <b>Bush</b> administration had continued to have negative views about the PLO also following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf war, and when asked at a press conference immediately after the Gulf War about a possible dialog with the PLO, Bush stated:to me, they've lost credibility. They've lost credibility with this office right here. And the reason they have is because they behaved very badly to those of their own fundamental faith.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The 3 D {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model and fluid structure interaction (FSI) model of water-lubricated rubber bearing with 10 axial grooves was built by ADINA and the influences of axial velocity, rotating speed on deformation of bearing bush and distribution of water film pressure are researched in this article. The results show that elastic deformation of bearing bush reduces water film pressure relative to rigid assumption; with the increasing of axial velocity, the deformation of bearing bush and water film pressure increases; and the axial velocity has a obvious influence on the <b>front</b> of bearing <b>bush</b> and water film pressure; with the increasing of bearing rotating speed, the deformation of bearing bush and water film pressure raises, but the deformation of bearing bush and water film pressure in water grooves are almost close to zero...|$|R
