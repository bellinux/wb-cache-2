500|$|In Chicago, {{he founded}} the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which {{provided}} advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly [...] "Saturday Blade", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the [...] "Chicago Ledger", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 {{he founded the}} international [...] "Boyce's Weekly", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union [...] leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for [...] "Boyce's Weekly". Eight months later, [...] "Boyce's Weekly" [...] was consolidated with the [...] "Saturday Blade." [...] Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers [...] "Farm Business" [...] in 1914 and [...] "Home Folks Magazine" [...] in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the [...] "Blade" [...] and [...] "Ledger" [...] into the monthly [...] "Chicago Blade & Ledger", which was published until 1937. As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him {{gain an understanding of}} America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: [...] "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. <b>Help</b> <b>yourself</b> and others will help you." [...] and [...] "whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished".|$|E

2500|$|In a 1976 phone {{conversation}} with John Maher, Jones alternately {{stated that he}} was an agnostic and an atheist.

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. Is {{there such a thing as}} an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if you <b>help</b> <b>yourself</b> then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.
