Over time, these measurements will serve both to validate measurements from the AURA satellite program and to probe the chemistry and physics of small scale phenomena that drive regional scale changes. Practically, such measurements present specic criteria for instrument design: the detection technique must be sufciently general to allow many species to be monitored, sufciently compact and lightweight to allow ights on small aircraft, sufciently robust to withstand the rigors of ight, and sufciently simple to produce reliable and trusted results.

40|$|Introduction Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L., Betulaceae family) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cultivated}} and consumed nuts in the world, not only as whole fruit (raw or roasted) but also incorporated as an ingredient into manufactured food products. Substantial quantities of by-products, including the green leafy cover, hard shell, and skin, are produced during harvesting and industrial processing of hazelnuts. The hard shells account for a majority of this waste and represent a huge amount of discarded material available at very low cost. Nowadays, the hazelnuts shells are used for burning as a heat source, for mulching, and as a raw material for the production of furfural in the dye industry (Stévigny C., et al. 2007). In the last years, great attention has been paid to the recovery and upgrading of agro-industrial residues as potential sources of bioactive compounds with beneficial effects on human health, and some papers have already showed the potential use of hazelnut wastes as natural antioxidants (Shaidi F., et al. 2007; Contini M., et al. 2008). In this research we report for the first time the chemical composition of a polar extract obtained from hazelnuts hard shells. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of the extract and its constituents has been evaluated on A 375 and SK-Mel- 28 (melanoma cancer cell lines) and Hela (cervical carcinoma cell line) cells. Methods Hazelnut (var. Mortarella and San Giovanni in mixture) hard shells were kindly supplied by a local hazelnut processing industry (Hazelnuts South Italy Manufacturing s. r. l., Baiano, AV). The shells were defatted with n-hexane and chloroform and then extracted with methanol. This extract was purified by Sephadex LH- 20 followed by RP-HPLC to give twelve compounds. Their structures were elucidated using spectroscopic methods including 1 D- and 2 D-NMR experiments as well as ESIMS analysis. The polyphenols content of the extract was examined by the Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetric assay (Picerno P., et al. 2011). The concentrations of the major compounds were determined by a RP-HPLC-DAD <b>direct</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method.</b> The free-radical scavenging activity of both the extract and pure compounds was evaluated by DPPH-test (Picerno P., et al. 2011). The effects of hazelnut shells extract and its constituents on cell proliferation and apoptosis on human cancer cell lines were evaluated by the MTT bioassay and propidium iodide staining, respectively (MencheriniT., er al. 2011) Results The phytochemical investigation of the methanol extract of hazelnut shells led to the isolation and characterization of four neolignans, seven phenolic compounds, and a diarylheptanoid.

The dust is unrelated spectrally to the rock but is equivalent to the global-scale dust observed telescopically. A new method was developed to model a multispectral image as mixtures of end-member spectra and to compare image spectra directly with laboratory reference spectra.

Alternative, data driven, methods {{can be useful}} to monitor possible drifts of the TOF offsets directly from clinical data. A simple data driven method [5], [6] is the indirect method, which exploits {{the fact that the}} TOF summed data are not affected by a timing bias. Recently [7] we introduced a faster <b>direct</b> data driven <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> for a single ring PET scanner, which does not require a non-TOF reconstruction. The algorithm was derived for a continuous 2 D model, assuming as in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that the TOF misalignment of each LOR is the difference between the timing offsets of the two crystals in coincidence. The consistency equations for TOF PET [8] lead to a relation between the data and the crystal offsets, which is linear, only involves the two first moments of the TOF data, and is independent of the TOF resolution. Although derived for a continuous model the method was successfully implemented for a simulated single ring scanner with 48 blocks of 13 detectors, separated by a gap of one detector. We will present numerical results from [7], which show that this consistency based calibration, while not matching the accuracy of the indirect method, nevertheless recovers the timing offsets with small errors compared to the TOF resolution and have a limited impact on OSEM reconstructions.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 A common {{difficulty}} in implementing flexible automation is {{the complexity and}} lack of robustness of the intercalibration of all {{the components of the}} workcell and the part itself. A novel approach to the <b>calibration</b> problem, called <b>Direct</b> <b>Calibration,</b> calibrates the entire assembly system [...] -the robot, the sensors, and the parts to be assembled [...] -in a single procedure. The relationship between feature information in sensor coordinates and the part location in robot coordinates is determined in three steps: calibration data are generated by using the robot to move the part to be assembled under the view of the sensors by known amounts; the best-fit mapping representing this assembly process is calculated; and this mapping is used in production to estimate the part locations from the current sensor data. While this approach has been demonstrated to work very well in its current application, this research establishes which basis functions should be used in the <b>Direct</b> <b>Calibration</b> mapping for optimal process performance. Furthermore, this work generates {{a better understanding of the}} significance of the basis functions for the process performance. "Perfect" basis functions are developed for the most common classes of parts. These perfect basis functions are broken down into their elementary terms and compared to the basis function set that was found to be suited best for a general application of <b>Direct</b> <b>Calibration.</b> The limits to performance improvement of the <b>Direct</b> <b>Calibration</b> technique due to changes in basis functions for certain classes of parts are established in simulation.

We show how a simple modification of a standard capacitive level gauge (segmentation of one of the electrodes) permits a <b>direct</b> <b>calibration</b> of the capacitance versus phase boundary position. We compare this <b>direct</b> <b>calibration</b> with the indirect procedure that must be adopted for a conventional capacitive level gauge. The device facilitates the correct adjustment of the 3 He/ 4 He fraction in the dilution refrigerator. Comment: 3 page...|$|R
30|$|The {{image-based}} FAF <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> {{does not}} require specific phantom acquisitions and is intrinsically adapted to each acquisition conditions: reconstruction parameters, radionuclides, and attenuation configurations. It could limit systematic bias that could potentially occur with standard calibration protocol. In practice, we advocate the use of those two independent <b>calibration</b> <b>methods,</b> phantom-based and image-based, as quality assurance.|$|R
