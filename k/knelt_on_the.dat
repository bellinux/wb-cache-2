5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing the Volunteers {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Volunteers found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced the ball with a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete passes. On fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E
25|$|Security {{cordoned off}} the east {{entrance}} to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier Li Peng. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.|$|E
25|$|The Giants wasted {{several seconds}} in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and {{took it upon himself}} to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
60|$|Cynthia <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass {{beside him}} and caught his hands in hers.|$|R
60|$|To this O'Brien agreed. A {{handkerchief}} {{was tied}} over his eyes, blindfolding him, and he <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck {{with his back}} to Sullivan.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated as if {{he would}} go on, and then he <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass a little way from her and seated himself. There was an {{interval}} of silence.|$|R
500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood {{at the back of the}} bus, and Officer Lang walked along the aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and where they were going. None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{government}} representatives and the Chilean public have repeatedly credited Divine Providence with keeping the miners alive while the Chilean public viewed their subsequent rescue as a miracle. Chile's president Sebastián Piñera stated, [...] "When the first miner emerges safe and sound, I hope all the bells {{of all the}} churches of Chile ring out forcefully, with joy and hope. Faith has moved mountains." [...] When Esteban Rojas {{stepped out of the}} rescue capsule, he immediately <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground with his hands together in prayer then raised his arms above him in adoration. His wife then wrapped a tapestry bearing the image of The Virgin Mary around him as they hugged and cried.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{decided to}} leave Britain for Australia. There were complications; having married Balawaider, Florance had {{acquired}} Polish nationality and was classified as an alien. Balawaider had war service credentials {{and was able to}} fly ahead to Australia, but Florance had to deal with official obstacles before she and the three children could embark on the Aberdeen & Commonwealth Line vessel [...] "Esperance Bay" [...] on 6 March 1948. On arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalls that his mother [...] "ran down the gangplank ahead of everyone else and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, and <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, 'Oh, Australia, Australia, I'm home, I'm home. My lovely country'" [...] Florance was soon reunited with her husband and the family moved into a run-down wooden cottage in Prahan, a suburb of Melbourne.|$|E
60|$|She <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth {{and took}} her friend's hands excitedly in her own. But after all she did not say when or how {{she had seen him}} or what he had said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I wouldn't talk much, Miss Birdseye," [...] said Doctor Prance, who had now <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other side}} of her. [...] "We {{know how much you}} have done. Don't you suppose every one knows your life?" ...|$|R
60|$|Annie <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> him, <b>the</b> {{other girls}} <b>knelt</b> and hung <b>on</b> to him. Their faces were flushed, their hair wild, {{their eyes were}} all {{glittering}} strangely. He lay at last quite still, with face averted, as an animal lies when it is defeated and {{at the mercy of}} the captor. Sometimes his eye glanced back at the wild faces of the girls. His breast rose heavily, his wrists were torn.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the third}} track on the album, [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] conveys the same sad and resentful outlook {{of the two}} {{preceding}} songs. Music critic Richie Unterberger views it as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song". It was the first song recorded for the album and features a two-part harmony sung by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney recalled: [...] "'Baby's in Black' we did because we liked waltz-time... And I think also John and I {{wanted to do something}} bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop." [...] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, {{as an example of the}} Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tactics of}} the Fulani were {{continually}} refined over time, as they gained more victories and themselves began to acquire numbers of horses for their own cavalry arm. Dan Fodio wrote on tactics employed by his forces as the jihad campaign unfolded: The infantry armed themselves with large shields (diraq) and carried long lances and javelin. Grouped into ranks, a spearman <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left knee, holding his round shield before him. Behind the ranks of spearmen the archers stood ready. They were ordered to shoot at the enemy horse and men in chain mail (duru). As the enemy cavalry approached the infantry would launch its javelins and the archers would keep shooting. If the enemy wavered, the infantry formation would then part left and right, so that their own cavalry was unleashed in pursuit. The writings of Dan Fodio on tactics echo a sentiment that would be approved by many a military commander: [...] "Concentration {{is the first thing}} in victory: the beginning of defeat is dispersion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nguyễn Công Minh, {{daughter}} of the Deputy Mayor of Huế at the time, reported that her father, who was of old age, was arrested {{at his home in}} the beginning of the Communist occupation, 3 days after he ordered his children (incl. Nguyễn Công Minh) and wife to flee via the back of their house when Communist troops first came knocking at their home. Upon telling the troops that he was Deputy Mayor of Huế who was set to retire in one year (1969), he was ordered to report to a camp for reeducation, and pack clothing and food sufficient for 10 days. He was never seen again, nor were his remains recovered. [...] She recalled that in the search of her father's remains, she witnessed that many of the bodies she came across in the mass graves were found to be in a fetal position, with their hands tied behind their backs, and the back of the heads/skulls were smashed, indicating that they <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground prior to their deaths and they died due to blunt-force trauma to their heads.|$|E
60|$|And Eustace <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other side}} of the sufferer, and {{interpreted}} his thieves' dialect into Latin; and the dying man held a hand of each, and turned first to one and then to the other stupid eyes,--not without affection, though, and gratitude.|$|R
60|$|Honoria <b>knelt</b> quietly down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, and watched, {{silent and}} motionless, the dead face, with her wide, awestruck eyes.|$|R
6000|$|But {{her brother}} had passed in between them and her, [...] And calmly <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high-altar stair-- [...] Of an infantine aspect so stern to the view [...] That the priest could not smile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> child's eyes of blue [...] As he would for another.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor--and hesitated. 'Might I ask you, sir, {{to give me}} my gloves?' he said. 'They are in my hat, on {{the chair}} behind you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Caraccioli, {{aided by}} the priest, <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scaffold; for the rope hung loose enough to permit that act of humiliation, and the other bent at his side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boost on that winder," [...] {{commanded}} Lyman. She {{raised it}} enough to admit his head, which came just above the sill; then she <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor by the window.|$|E
60|$|Gervaise {{took out}} the small brooch, that {{fastened}} {{the collar of his}} silken doublet, and then <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> one knee. <b>The</b> girl fastened the clasp round his neck, and as he rose he hid the heart beneath the doublet, and fastened the collar.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{took the}} torch with {{trembling}} fingers and <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor {{to examine it}} closely. He started back from the place, as he {{saw that it was}} quite dry--the torch dropped upon <b>the</b> hearth--he fell <b>on</b> his knees before the statue of the Virgin and hid his face.|$|R
6000|$|Oldbuck, {{with his}} {{spectacles}} on his nose, had already <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> monument, and was tracing, partly with his eye, partly with his finger, the mouldered devices upon the effigy {{of the deceased}} warrior. [...] "It is the Knockwinnock arms, sure enough," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "quarterly with the coat of Wardour." ...|$|R
60|$|The terrier howled, and Mrs. St. John Deloraine had {{scarcely}} {{grasped the}} hand which Mr. Cranley extended with enthusiasm, when she <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> carpet and was consoling the Dandie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come out," [...] said Mrs. Gibbs, in a raspy voice. She <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{deck and}} twined {{her fingers in}} his hair. The mate {{addressed}} her in terms rendered brotherly by pain.|$|E
60|$|With that {{question}} overshadowing all {{else in his}} mind, {{the son of the}} homicide <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck, and looked at the son of the man whom his father's hand had slain.|$|E
60|$|But Juliette {{had caught}} the look too. The tension of her nerves seemed {{suddenly}} to relax. Memory rushed back upon her with tumultuous intensity. Very gradually her knees gave beneath her, and at last she <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor before him, her golden head bent under the burden of her guilt and her shame.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>knelt,</b> {{and leaning}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair [...] He prayed and fell asleep; [...] And the moth-hour {{went from the}} fields, [...] And stars began to peep.|$|R
60|$|So in {{some ways}} that was to me at least a gladsome Sunday, though not half so much {{at the time as}} it has become in remembrance, and I could not guess how much of {{conscious}} peace or joy Harold felt, as, for the first and only time, he and I <b>knelt</b> together <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chancel step.|$|R
60|$|It {{required}} {{minutes for}} the mourners to recover their self-command. When the latter returned, however, all <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, the line of soldiers included, and the closing prayers were raised to the throne of God.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Downing {{uttered a}} grunt of satisfaction, and bent {{once more to}} his task. Boots flew about the room. Mr. Downing <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor beside the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat-hole.|$|E
6000|$|They got up resignedly, {{for they}} were really very good children. [...] "Say your prayers here before you go," [...] said the Lady. The three little figures all <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rug, Baby still cuddling her Wriggly.|$|E
60|$|Cyril <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ground as}} before, in an agony of suspense, and struck the rail three times {{distinctly}} with his walking-stick. Then {{he put his}} ear to it and listened, and waited. In {{less than half a}} minute three answering knocks rang, dim but unmistakable, along the buried rail. He could even feel <b>the</b> vibration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> iron with his face.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood up}} {{abruptly}} and then <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{by the side}} of the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd. People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of the [...] "Jolly Cricketers" [...] stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said.|$|R
60|$|It was wonderfully carved; that dying {{face was}} full of pity. Would not He Whom it {{represented}} pity her? She <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topmost step, and clasping the pierced feet with her arms, began to pray earnestly, not for herself but that she might save her father. She prayed as she had never prayed before, and so praying, sank into a torpor or a swoon.|$|R
