500|$|On March13, Hagerstrom and his wingman Elmer N. Dunlap {{came across}} two MiGs, {{the first of}} which Hagerstrom [...] "shot the daylights out of". He shot at the second until he ran out of ammunition, and the {{remaining}} MiG was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped. Hagerstrom told Dunlap to [...] "finish off" [...] the crippled plane, and the MiG's pilot bailed over the enemy's Antung Airfield. That mission gave him a total of 4.5 victories, just short of the five kills needed for ace status. Knowing that he was likely to be transferred out soon, he became even more determined to get another kill. On March27 he sneaked up behind six MiGs and fired on one, but by [...] "sheer ass luck ... it knocked his wing tip off." [...] He kept up the chase, shooting short bursts, until the pilot, Chinese ace Wang Hai, ejected right above his own base. On the way home, Hagerstrom destroyed another MiG, bringing the total to 6.5. He became the war's 28th ace and would be the only from the 18th wing. Before the Air Force sent him back to the U.S., he <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> MiG on April13. On his last day in Korea, while waiting for his flight out, he volunteered to do an impromptu mission, netting his last kill. This gave him a sum of 8.5 throughout the whole war over 101 missions.|$|E

He'll be there one more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll. (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is {{no question in my mind}} that USC is the best team in the country and may be the best team in the history of college football." [...] The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009. Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. Harbaugh never lost in USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E

Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were behind 18-12. In the sixty-third minute the Tigers had the ball down near the Cowboys' try-line and moved it out to Daniel Fitzhenry on the right wing to dive over in the corner. Hodgson kicked the goal from near the sideline to convert the try, taking the Tigers' lead out to 24-12. With {{six and a half}} minutes remaining, Tigers half-back Scott Prince attempted a field goal but missed. Shortly after that Cowboys winger Matt Sing almost scored a try but the video referee found that he'd knocked on. A few minutes later though, the Cowboys were down close to the Tigers' try line where their half-back Johnathan Thurston threw a cut out pass to Matt Sing to score on the right wing. Josh Hannay missed the conversion so the score was 24-16 in favour of the Tigers with under two minutes left to play. Seconds before the final siren the Tigers <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> try when Hodgson, from ten metres out, put a grubber kick into the Cowboys' in-goal area for Todd Payten to dive onto.

I just quietly stole a look down at her left hand, and saw that there was no wedding-ring on her finger, and guessed what she meant.

To these advances the Princess of Mogador returned a gracious and affable salutation, exchanging glances of peculiar meaning with two highly respectable bearded gentlemen who travelled in her suite; and, when asked by milady whereabouts her highness's residence was at Paris, said that her hotel was in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette: where Lady Kicklebury hoped to have the honor of waiting upon Madame la Princesse de Mogador.|$|E
