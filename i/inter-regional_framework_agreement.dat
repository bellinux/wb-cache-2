40|$|The European Union (EU) and MERCOSUR are {{the largest}} and most {{influential}} regions, both by population and in terms of size of the economy, of their respective continents. The renewed priority given to biregional cooperation launched by the <b>Inter-Regional</b> <b>Framework</b> <b>Agreement</b> signed in 1995 is based on deep historical, political, economic and cultural links between the two regions. The potential advantages of an agreement that will foster a process of dynamic cooperation are enormous, ranging from political influence to economic returns, including the gains from comparative advantage, expanding markets, improved environment for investments, and positive spillovers on human and social capital, democracy, and justice. A free trade agreement between the two regions should also be evaluated {{in the context of the}} new regionalism initiatives taking place around the world, in particular the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations and the process of enlargement and deepening of the two regional blocs. The objective of this paper is to offer an X-ray of the current status of existing market access provisions both in MERCOSUR and the EU. This is an important and necessary first step to identify the key issues facing market access negotiators from the very outset of the negotiations. As has already been agreed during the first meeting of the European Union - Mercosur Biregional Negotiations Committee, one of the first tasks of the Technical Group charged with market access issues will be the exchange of information in the areas of tariff and non-tariff measures. This initial exchange of information among negotiating parties usually plays a key role in the overall formulation of each party's negotiating strategy. This paper attempts, using mostly secondary sources and data compiled by international agencies, to take a seat at the negotiating table and provide the best snapshot possible of the situation. In this regard, it is important to stress that the information used and analyzed in this paper should not be taken in any way as the official picture of the market access profiles of each region...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine the motivations for the European Union’s (EU) policy towards the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the EU’s most {{important}} relationship with another regional economic integration organisation. As such, the EUMercosur relationship has a prominent place {{in the literature on}} the EU as a global actor. This thesis argues that the dominant explanations in the literature [...] balancing the US, global aspirations, being an external federator, long-standing economic and cultural ties, economic interdependence, and the Europeanization of Spanish and Portuguese national foreign policies – fail to adequately explain the EU’s policy. In particular, these accounts tend to infer the EU’s motives from its activity. Drawing extensive primary documents, this thesis argues that the major developments in the relationship [...] the 1992 Interinstitutional Agreement and the 1995 Europe Mercosur <b>Inter-regional</b> <b>Framework</b> Cooperation <b>Agreement</b> – were initiated by Mercosur. Moreover, a free trade agreement was included in the latter agreement which negotiations finally started in 1999 due to the insistence of Mercosur. This means that rather than the EU pursuing a strategy, as implied by most of the existing literature, the EU was largely responsive. How it responded to Mercosur’s overtures, however, has been influenced by some of the factors highlighted in the literature, most notably the Europeanisation of Portuguese and, particularly, Spanish foreign policies. Also the Commission’s role as external federator has influenced as well, although to a lesser extent. Overall, however, these supposedly causal factors have provided only a very weak impetus for EU policy, which explains in large part why the relationship is much less developed than the EU’s relations with other parts of the world. Beyond providing a distinctive and empirically rich account of the EU’s relationship with Mercosur, this thesis contributes to the literature on the EU as a global actor, particularly {{the extent to which it}} is a strategic actor, and to the literature on Europeanization of national foreign policies of member states from a bottom-up perspective with the case of Spain and Portugal...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction). The “Southern Cone Common Market” {{was created}} in 1991 not with the aim, as its name would imply, of {{achieving}} just an economic integration of its member states, but rather of creating a meaningful entity encompassing the political, productive and social aspects of its member states. By joining forces, its four member states (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) represent the single largest market in Latin America, with 210 million inhabitants and a total GDP of US$ 1. 1 trillion, representing the fourth largest economic entity in the world. (1) Since the 1994 Protocol of Ouro Preto, Mercosur has followed {{the spirit of the}} European Union in its ambitious objective of creating a large supranational entity rather than remaining at the intergovernmental integration level sought by other regional blocs, such as NAFTA. The EU has been working to strengthen its ties with Mercosur since 1992, with the signature of the Technical Cooperation Agreement. In the following years, {{the relationship between the two}} blocs has evolved considerably. In 1995, both parties signed an <b>Inter-Regional</b> <b>Framework</b> Cooperation <b>Agreement,</b> which initiated the process towards a definitive Association Agreement. A series of negotiation rounds was carried out starting in the year 2000 with the objective of hammering out the details for a free trade agreement. Beyond the historical and political linkages between the Mercosur member states and Europe, the association with the European Union is important for several reasons. First, from a purely economic point of view, both regions are already intimately tied as the EU is Mercosur’s largest trading partner and source of foreign direct investment. Second, as previously mentioned, Mercosur’s framework draws significantly from the EU model. In this sense, the experiences from the EU can represent a valuable resource at the time of designing Mercosur’s institutions and implementing any necessary policies. Third, Mercosur’s member countries, and in particular Brazil, are interested in raising their profile in the international geopolitical arena. In this sense, an association with the EU would give Mercosur member states a significant degree of leverage and prestige. Finally, and not unrelated to the previous point, any progress in its association discussions with the European Union could strengthen Mercosur’s position in the context of the future FTAA negotiations. From the European point of view, any closer relationship with Mercosur would be valuable because, first, Mercosur comprises two of the three largest markets in Latin America, with product offerings that are largely complementary to those of the EU. Secondly, Mercosur is the only other integration agreement that shares the EU’s values and ideals. (2) And third, it is an objective of the EU to avoid any deviation of commerce that might arise from the implementation of the FTAA. This paper summarizes the three main aspects of the EU-Mercosur economic relations. These aspects are foreign direct investment flows, trade and foreign aid...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} nature of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in public {{procurement}} in Sweden. The main question is whether a contracting authority is obligated to place orders under a <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> when purchasing a product or service that is covered in that agreement and to what extent a contractor is obligated to accept such orders. If the answer to that first question is that an obligation does exist the next question to arise is what kind of consequences to expect when either party fails to meet that obligation. Of great importance is whether a contracting authority that hasn’t used an existing <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> is liable to pay damages to the contractor who according to the agreement had a right to deliver. A summary of the results is that the answers to all of the questions depend on what type of <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> that is used, whether it’s a contract that has one or several contractors and if all the terms for future contracts are specified. <b>Framework</b> <b>agreements</b> with only one contractor and where all the terms for future contracts have been established are very similar to normal public contracts, which means that it would make sense to use the same set of rules. In this case it’s therefore likely that both parties are obligated by the <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> and that failure to live up to these obligations can result in liability. A <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> with several contractors where all the terms are not established and where contracts are awarded only after a renewed evaluation of tenders is on the other hand quite different from a public contract. One should therefore not be surprised to find that other rules may apply. Unfortunately I have been unable to give definitive answers to most questions because the available sources are too limited. This thesis is therefore a call to the legislator to clarify and also a call for the increased understanding of, and improved statistics regarding, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> that is necessary to improve public procurement...|$|R
