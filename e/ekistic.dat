5000|$|Doxiadis {{believed}} that the conclusion from biological and social experience was clear: to avoid chaos we must organize our system of life from Anthropos (individual) to Ecumenopolis (global city) in hierarchical levels, represented by human settlements. So he articulated a general hierarchical scale with fifteen levels of <b>Ekistic</b> Units: ...|$|E
50|$|As a {{scientific}} mode of study, ekistics currently relies on statistics and description, organized in five <b>ekistic</b> elements or principles: nature, anthropos, society, shells, and networks. It is generally a more scientific field than urban planning, and has considerable overlap {{with some of}} the less restrained fields of architectural theory.|$|E
50|$|The Symposium was {{organized}} by the Greek architect-planner, Constantinos Doxiadis in the Aegean Sea, on board his yacht, and was held each June from 1962 through 1974, lasting about ten days. The proceedings were published in Ekistics Journal. Each year, prior to the Symposium, the Athens <b>Ekistic</b> Week was held, involving the Symposium participants in a larger meeting.|$|E

5000|$|The shorter Oxford English Dictionary {{contains}} {{a reference to}} an oecist, oekist or oikist, defining him as: [...] "the founder of an ancient Greek ... colony". The English equivalent of oikistikh is ekistics (a noun). In addition, the adjectives <b>ekistic</b> and ekistical, the adverb ekistically, and the noun ekistician are now also in current use. The French equivalent is ékistique, the German oekistik, the Italian echistica (all feminine).|$|E

5000|$|As Doxiadis put it “Ekistics is a science, even if in {{our times}} {{it is usually}} {{considered}} a technology and an art, without the foundations of a science. This is a mistake for which we pay very heavily.” Having recorded very successfully the destructions of the <b>ekistic</b> wealth in Greece during WWII, Doxiadis became convinced that human settlements are subjectable to systematic investigation. Doxiadis being aware of the unifying power of systems thinking and particularly of the biological and evolutionary reference models as used by many famous biologists-philosophers of his generation, especially Sir Julian Huxley (1887-1975), Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-75), Dennis Gabor (1900-79), René Dubos (1901-82), George G. Simpson (1902-84), and Conrad Waddington (1905-75), used the biological model to describe the [...] "Ekistic behavior" [...] of Anthropos (the five principles) and the evolutionary model to explain the morphogenesis of human settlements (the eleven forces, the hierarchical structure of human settlements, dynapolis, ecumenopolis). Finally, he formulated a general theory which considers human settlements as living organisms capable of evolution, an evolution that might be guided by Man using [...] "Ekistic knowledge".|$|E
40|$|Through an intersectional Marxist, Post-Structuralist, Eco-Feminist lens, {{this study}} {{responds}} to Humberstone’s query if outdoor activities can challenge and transform gender inequalities or if outdoor activities must maintain and reproduce these inequalities (2000). I begin by discussing hegemony and hegemonic masculinity {{in order to}} critically assess traditional sport, outdoor activities, and the hegemonic constraints in accessing leisure experienced by women. The examples and discussion I provide demonstrate that extraordinary constraints persist in the 21 st century, especially {{in the form of}} sexualization, infantilization, marginalization, and delegitimization of female athletes. I argue that Outdoor Education, due to its unique goals and values, is an excellent venue for challenging hegemonic masculinity. I distinguish Outdoor Education as having different goals than other forms of activity in the outdoors; Outdoor Education is an experiential method of learning that aims to explore intrapersonal, interpersonal, ecosystemic, and <b>ekistic</b> relationships in outdoor environments (Priest 2005). Outdoor Education is capable of manifesting challenges to hegemony most when coupled with what I call ‘Feminist Outdoor Leadership. ’ Feminist Outdoor Leadership shares power horizontally, acknowledges expressions of domination in space and language, invites participants to participate with their whole, emotional and relational selves, and is attentive to how gender role socialization affects technical skill development and confidence...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the sustainability of}} introduced shelter systems and hardware in remote indigenous Australian communities. European colonisation has substantially influenced the lifestyles of indigenous Australians through introduced technologies, training and development policies. Previous {{studies have focused on}} specialist approaches in health, economics and education. Little Australian research exists which integrates the underlying social, technical and contextual factors affecting the sustainability of introduced technologies. This {{study examines}} the thesis that to improve the sustainability of introduced technologies {{there is a need to}} develop a holistic understanding of technological activity. It will be argued that this holistic understanding begins with developing knowledge of how the above-mentioned factors singularly and collectively influence the capacity of communities to manage introduced technologies. Cross-discipline research in small and remote settlements has been constrained by a dearth of appropriate theoretical frameworks. This thesis develops and proposes a framework that integrates selective aspects of <b>ekistic</b> classification theory with socio-technical systems theory. The model emphasises research at the level of community functions. It defines these functions as socio-technical systems that are influenced by their greater settlement environment. The integrated framework of this study helped to identify new knowledge and data patterns while also confirming existing knowledge of shelter and training in indigenous Australian communities. Most communities struggled to learn from their technology choice and maintenance experiences. Many indigenous Australians adopted incompatible social organization patterns to that needed to sustain introduced technologies. These communities were organisationally and technically ill-equipped/poorly supported to manage their shelter systems and hardware. Several communities had difficulty reconciling traditional social organisation with introduced shelter management needs and vocational training policies. Many communities were attempting to function substantially below their critical minimum of occupational skills. As a result of the research it was recommended that communities and government develop principles of indigenous technological empowerment. These principles included a greater emphasis on skills development in technacy (holistic technological problem solving) and organisational (project) management as well as processes that foster innovations and local innovators rather than perpetuating specialist technical skills training alone. A case was found for government to develop policies and programs that supported local independent technology services similar to those in community health and education...|$|E
