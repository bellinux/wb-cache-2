5|$|The Madison Square Garden {{audience}} {{reacted with}} wild applause and demonstrations <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech {{and while he}} shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. <b>For</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{scheduled}} broadcast {{time was}} 21:00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast {{by up to}} 40 minutes. This led to conflicts with other channels and COMFER, the institution that regulates Argentine television. The last episode lasted <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and {{was followed by the}} premiere of the new telenovela Son de Fierro; La Nación said that the final episode should have lasted a full hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{but was unable}} to demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers was {{distributed}} both {{on television and}} online. It ran for a single series of eleven episodes: the first ten episodes lasted for five minutes each, with the final compilation episode running <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and gaining a viewership peak of half a million. Chartjackers premiered on BBC Two on 12 September 2009 at 12:50p.m., {{as part of the}} channel's two-hour-long BBC Switch segment – it was uploaded to the YouTube channel BBCSwitch the same day. This practice of broadcasting an episode on BBC Two and uploading it to the BBCSwitch channel the same day continued throughout the series. Episodes were also streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents for seven days after their initial broadcast. The show was not broadcast outside of the UK and, , is not available on DVD.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, {{it was estimated that}} 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E

5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|The condor soars {{with its}} wings held {{horizontally}} and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The {{lack of a}} large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.|$|E
5|$|Against Third Division Luton Town in the quarter-final, Everton won comfortably. The match {{remained}} scoreless <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{but after}} Stein opened the scoring for Everton the match became one-sided, and ended 6–0. Stein and Johnson both scored twice, {{along with a}} goal each for Dunn and Dean, the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round. By this time Everton were viewed as favourites to win the competition. In the semi-final they played West Ham at Molineux, Wolverhampton. Everton {{took the lead in}} the sixth minute. A corner kick by Stein was headed on by Johnson, and then headed into the net by Dunn. Everton had the better of the play in the first half, but Vic Watson scored for West Ham just before half-time. In the second half West Ham's Woods missed an open goal from six yards (5.5m). Everton then capitalised on their reprieve. With seven minutes remaining, a mistake by Jim Barrett allowed Edward Critchley to go clear on goal and score the winner.|$|E

5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|Révolutionnaire had {{suffered}} much more severely than Audacious, but survived the encounter without being boarded {{thanks to a}} misread signal by Captain Albemarle Bertie of Thunderer, who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to. During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue Révolutionnaire, and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line Audacieux, the frigate Bellone, and two corvettes. Once more Audacious came under fire from Révolutionnaire, leaving her {{no option but to}} flee this superior force. Audacious was chased <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> by Bellone and the corvettes, before losing them in a rain squall, and eventually returned to Plymouth on 3 June. Révolutionnaire also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by Audacieux, who brought her safely to Rochefort several days later. For leaving the battlefleet before the main engagement, Révolutionnaires captain was subsequently arrested.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested <b>for</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 {{that the mission}} had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> Lion {{continued}} to fire {{into the larger}} Guillaume Tell, but Dixon was unable to keep his ship completely {{out of range of}} the French broadsides and by 05:30 the subsequent damage showed an effect, Lion dropping back and falling behind the French vessel, although remaining within range alongside Penelope. At 06:00, Guillaume Tell came under attack for the third time, when Berry himself caught up with the battling ships in Foudroyant and pulled along the starboard broadside of the French ship of the line. Berry hailed Decrés to demand his surrender, and accompanied the demand with a triple-shotted broadside, to which Decrés responded with fire from his own guns. Foudroyant was flying a full set of sails and therefore suffered severe damage to its rigging in the opening exchange, the additional speed provided by this rig forcing Foudroyant to move ahead of the French vessel. After working back alongside Guillaume Tell, Berry recommenced fire that rapidly tore away much of the remaining French rigging, allowing Lion and Penelope to return to the battle while Foudroyant dropped back to make urgent repairs.|$|E
