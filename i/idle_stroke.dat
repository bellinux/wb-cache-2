40|$|International audienceAs {{concerns}} of dynamic tensile measuring, a new tension mechanism driven by liner motor in High-Speed Tensile Testing Machine is presented. It satisfies {{the requirements for}} testing the dynamic tensile properties of plastic materials with strain rates from 1 to 100 s- 1. For this purpose the <b>idle</b> <b>stroke</b> principle is used to realize the dynamic load of plastic material with static grip. Computer Aided Engineering technology is used: i). to analyze and optimize the tension mechanism thus allowing reducing the system shock caused by collisions. ii). to avoid the influence of plastic materials specimen stress and strain uniformity on the measuring system. The analysis results agreed well with the established empirical relationships based on experimental evidence. Two sets of experiments for different strain rate tensile were conducted thus allowing proving the reliability and credibility of the designed tension mechanism...|$|E

For example, with servo presses once can make the <b>idle</b> <b>stroke</b> faster while the forming process is slower with soft touch of the forming tools onto the workpiece. Recent developments deal with the optimized movement of the ram and the cushion during the forming process to locally influence part properties or to extend forming limits. The tool design and interpretation of the processes can be supported by a systematic analysis of the influence of the parameter on the forming process. Within the present project advanced process models were developed, which consider the elastic characteristics of the machine during a sensitivity analysis of sheet metal forming processes. The advanced process models improve the prognosis of deep drawing process with variable motion paths. The developed sensitivity analysis based on current planning methods. The simulation tools were updated and automated to work with variable motion paths. Metamodels can be generated {{as a result of the}} sensitivity analysis, which approximate the system behavior of the process and the press machine for the selected configuration. Then optimal setting parameters for the process can be derived from the metamodel...|$|E
