50|$|Frying is {{a common}} {{dehydration}} process for producing <b>instant</b> <b>noodles.</b> Therefore, oil becomes {{an important component of}} <b>instant</b> <b>noodles.</b> According to USDA regulation, oil-fried <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. Therefore, the high fat content of <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> is always the reason why consumers who are pursuing healthy diets would not buy this product. Palm oil is always chosen as the frying oil for <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high fat content and low moisture content, <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off flavors and health risking compounds, some <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content.

50|$|Even though dry <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> {{might not}} show {{any sign of}} elasticity, cooked <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> {{generally}} have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, which can give a unique springiness to the noodle strands. The wavy form of <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> is formed when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due {{to the difference between}} the velocity of conveying belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, and that creates the unique wavy form of <b>instant</b> <b>noodles.</b> During pressing by heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of <b>instant</b> <b>noodles.</b> <b>Instant</b> <b>noodles</b> require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are be broken during processing, which will make a more viscoelastic noodle dough and result in more elastic noodles. Furthermore, potato starch is a key ingredient in <b>instant</b> <b>noodles,</b> which has characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling. Therefore, the addition of starch could also increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in <b>instant</b> <b>noodles</b> also increase the elasticity of noodle strands. Salt, dissolved in water as ions, could strengthen the interaction between gluten structures which can also increase the elasticity of noodles.|$|R
