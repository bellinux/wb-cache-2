5|$|On 18 March 1994, six prisoners {{appeared}} in court {{on charges of}} <b>escaping</b> from custody during the second riot trial. Five of them pleaded guilty to <b>escaping</b> from custody on one occasion, and Mark Azzopardi pleaded guilty to <b>escaping</b> on two occasions. Each was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for <b>escaping</b> from Manchester Crown Court, and Azzopardi received an additional two-year sentence for <b>escaping</b> from the van transporting him from HM Prison Hull to the court. In July 1994, David Bowen was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by attempting to influence {{the jury in the}} first riot trial, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Paul Taylor, who had already pleaded guilty to the same charge, also received a three-year sentence.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Escape</b> response, <b>escape</b> reaction, or <b>escape</b> {{behaviour}} is {{a possible}} reaction in response to stimuli indicative of danger. In particular, it initiates an <b>escape</b> motion of an animal. In the cases of reflectory reactions, the <b>escape</b> response may also be called an <b>escape</b> reflex.|$|R

40|$|Successful {{predator}} evasion {{is essential}} to the fitness of many animals. Variation in <b>escape</b> behaviour may be adaptive as it reduces predictability, enhancing <b>escape</b> success. High <b>escape</b> velocities and accelerations also increase <b>escape</b> success, but biomechanical factors likely constrain the behavioural range over which performance can be maximized. There may therefore be a trade-off between variation and performance during <b>escape</b> responses. We have used bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) <b>escape</b> responses to examine this potential trade-off, determining the full repertoire of <b>escape</b> behaviour for individual bluegill sunfish and linking this to performance as indicated by <b>escape</b> velocity and acceleration. Fish <b>escapes</b> involve an initial C-bend of the body axis, followed by variable steering movements. These generate thrust and establish the <b>escape</b> direction. Directional changes during the initial C-bend were less variable than the final <b>escape</b> angle, and the most frequent directions were associated with high <b>escape</b> velocity. Significant inter-individual differences in <b>escape</b> angles magnified the overall variation, maintaining unpredictability from a predator perspective. Steering in the latter stages of the <b>escape</b> to establish the final <b>escape</b> trajectory also affected performance, with turns away from the stimulus associated with reduced velocity. This suggests that modulation of <b>escape</b> behaviour by steering may also have an associated performance cost. This has important implications for understanding the scope and control of intra- and inter-individual variation in <b>escape</b> behaviour and the associated costs and benefits...|$|R

Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only <b>escaping</b> by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. <b>Escaping</b> through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the Java programming language has made <b>escape</b> analysis a target of interest. Java's combination of heap-only object allocation, built-in threading, and the Sun HotSpot dynamic compiler creates a candidate platform for <b>escape</b> analysis related optimizations (see <b>Escape</b> analysis in Java). <b>Escape</b> analysis is implemented in Java Standard Edition 6. Some JVMs support a stronger variant of <b>escape</b> analysis called partial <b>escape</b> analysis that makes scalar replacement of an allocated object possible even if the object <b>escapes</b> in some paths of a function.|$|R

50|$|<b>Escape</b> {{characters}} {{are part of}} the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an <b>escape</b> character's purpose is to start character sequences (so named <b>escape</b> sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed <b>escape</b> character. An <b>escape</b> character may not have its own meaning, so all <b>escape</b> sequences are of two or more characters.|$|R

5000|$|Among other things, {{it must be}} {{possible}} to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant, plus {{there must be some}} way to specify the <b>escape</b> character itself. <b>Escape</b> sequences are not always pretty or easy to use, so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. <b>Escape</b> sequences, however, solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret <b>escape</b> sequences. When an <b>escape</b> character is inside a string literal, it means [...] "this is the start of the <b>escape</b> sequence". Every <b>escape</b> sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an <b>escape</b> sequence varies. The <b>escape</b> character is on the top/left of the keyboard, but the editor will translate it, therefore it is not directly tapeable into a string.

This first listing is of attempted <b>escapes,</b> <b>escapes</b> that did not lead to rescue, <b>escapes</b> that ended in recapture. The list is undoubtedly neither complete nor completely accurate. Neither the government nor the military has extensive information on most POWs from any war.

40|$|We adapted a multi-species <b>escape</b> model, {{developed}} for close-in extrasolar planets, {{to calculate the}} <b>escape</b> rates of CH 4 and N 2 from Pluto.

50|$|Once Enter has {{integrated}} Messiah Card 07 into himself, {{he is able}} {{to create}} Organic Metaroids, and uses that ability to recreate <b>Escape</b> and assimilated organic life into her data composition. As a result, making her a loyal servant, the recreated <b>Escape</b> can transform into the hybridized <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Organic Unite Form) (46-48). But the first three versions of <b>Escape,</b> each able to become <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Flower Unite Form) (Esukeipu Eborubu (Hana Yūgōtai)), are only incomplete copies of the original with limited intelligence and comprehension as they are created from back-up data of <b>Escape</b> predating her time of creation. However, due to the love data from Tiaraloid, Enter became obsessed with recreating a perfect copy of <b>Escape.</b> This resulted in the creation of an <b>Escape</b> from a snake who is extremely mentally unstable due to her composition being corrupted beyond Enter's ability to repair. Left to her devices, wanting to be like her creator, <b>Escape</b> assimilated various animals to assume her <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Animal Unite Form) (Esukeipu Eborubu (Kemono Yūgōtai)). Fighting the Go-Busters, <b>Escape</b> assimilates the surrounding matter to become <b>Escape</b> Zeta (48) before being fatally wounded in her Megazord body.

40|$|Punishment and <b>escape</b> {{were studied}} {{simultaneously}} by allowing a subject to <b>escape</b> from a stimulus {{situation in which}} responses were punished, into a stimulus situation in which responses were not punished. The frequency of the punished responses {{was found to be}} an inverse function of the intensity of punishment, whereas the frequency of the <b>escape</b> response was a direct function of the intensity of punishment. Both of these functions were obtained under three different schedules of food reinforcement. The strength of the <b>escape</b> behavior was evidenced by (1) the emergence of the <b>escape</b> response even when the frequency of food reinforcement decreased {{as a consequence of the}} <b>escape</b> response, (2) the maintenance of the <b>escape</b> response by fixed-interval and fixed-ratio schedules of <b>escape</b> reinforcement, and (3) the occurrence of <b>escape</b> responses at intensities of punishment that otherwise produced only mild suppression of the punished response when no <b>escape</b> was possible.
