40|$|SP- 4 D is a {{production}} {{well in the}} Mindanao Geothermal Production Field (MGPF), Philippines, which develops calcite deposition under flowing conditions. An inhibition system was installed in the well to prevent active deposition after a second mechanical work-over. Prior to running-in the downhole <b>injection</b> <b>assembly,</b> an obstruction was encountered at 830 meters measured depth (mMD) which limited setting depth to 815 mMD. Wellbore simulation studies indicated that if the well were operated at full-open conditions, the flash point depth (FPD) would below 940 mMD, below the calcite inhibitor injection point. With this expectation, the well’s operation was maintained at throttled conditions with a wellhead pressure greater than 12. 7 kg/cm 2 g {{in order to raise}} the FPD above 815 mMD. The flow dynamics with time were modeled using water flow data from tracer dilution measurements. The results indicated that the injection depth was initially at the boiling transition. The well’s output was observed to have deteriorated after about more than eleven months of utilization despite the continuous anti-scalant injection.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for centrosome assembly in somatic cells {{has previously been}} proposed to be microtubule independent. Studies presented in this dissertation demonstrate that in somatic cells pericentrin and γ tubulin, two paradigm centrosome proteins, assemble onto the centrosome in a microtubule, and dynein/dynactin dependent manner. High resolution, three-dimensional, time-lapse digital imaging of pericentrin-GFP labeled centrosomes has revealed tiny particles that move vectorally towards the centrosome at rates exceeding 1 μm/second. These pericentrin-GFP particles contain γ tubulin and are not readily visible by standard two-dimensional digital imaging microscopy. Further {{studies have shown that}} dynein colocalizes with tiny particles of endogenous pericentrin outside of the centrosome which may reflect assembly intermediates in transit towards the centrosome. Furthermore, when dynein function is disrupted in G 1 cells by nocodazole treatment, dynamitin overexpression, or dynein IC antibody (70. 1) <b>injection,</b> <b>assembly</b> of pericentrin and γ tubulin onto the centrosome throughout the cell cycle is greatly reduced. Moreover, microtubule co-sedimentation studies have demonstrated that pericentrin associates with microtubules in vitro and is dependent on functional dynein/dynactin. Together these data strongly suggest that pericentrin and γ tubulin are novel cargoes of the dynein/dynactin motor complex which transports these proteins -and likely other components of the 3 MDa nucleating complex (Dictenberg et al., 1998) - to the centrosome via rnicrotubules...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) is {{believed}} {{to play a major}} role in attentional processing in cortex, thereby contributing to memory formation and maintenance. Monitoring ACh level-changes during behavior will help to understand their role in neuronal communication and function. In contrast to other highly sensitive detectors like electrochemistry (EC), which are commonly used in the monitoring of changes of extracellular brain fluid (EBF), mass-spectrometry methods enable direct determination of Ach without additional enzyme reactor. Here, a push and pull sampling method with flow rates in the range of nano-liters/min is used to reduce depletion of the EBF, allowing for lower flow rates compared to conventional microdialysis. To match the requirement to determine amounts of Ach in the attomole amount of acetylcholine from an EBF sample, a nano HPLC-MS/MS with semi online sampling system was set up and tested. The <b>injection</b> <b>assembly</b> included a high pressure injection pump and a series of computer-controlled nanopeak valves. For each injection a 250 nl sample obtained in 5 -min sampling interval was pumped out from the sampling capillary tubing. Chromatographic separation was performed on a capillary column of 75 µm I. D. Each HPLC run was finished in 7 min with a stepwise elution profile used for fast analysis. After the injection, the sample was trapped by flushing the column with pure water for 2 min, and subsequently with high concentration of acetonitrile favored by electrospray ionization MS. In-vitro test shows that acetylcholine could be detected with a low detection-limit of 30 attomole. By repeating this method in vivo we were able to reliably detect acetylcholine in the awake macaque. Future experiments will apply this methodology in combined neurochemical-electrophysiological experiments in behaving animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current thesis work could be basically summarized as {{the realization of the}} flight version designs for the injector assembly and the combustion chamber head of a 500 N liquid bipropellant rocket engine. The work is embedded in the German Space Administration(DLR) -STERN project “SMART ROCKETS” consisting in the design, manufacture and flight campaign of a Liquid Oxygen-Ethanol propelled rocket. Both design problems were carried on in parallel, with the aim of not only realize a functional design capable of satisfying the driving requirements, but also amenable of being incorporated in the evolving engine concept, whose components interface features represent crucial aspects for the whole assembly realization and validation. The path toward the definition of the flight version coaxial swirl injector started with the characterization of the existing test injectors built within the project, based on existing flow models and experimental data gained through a series of cold flow and combustion tests. Those tests evidenced that the available fluid dynamic models, based on the strong hypothesis of inviscid flow, were only capable of accurately describe the behavior of the oxidizer injector while gave unacceptable prediction errors for the fuel injector, leading to the difficulty in find a reliable massflow-pressure correlation for the <b>injection</b> <b>assembly.</b> Therefore the focus shifted in enhancing the flow model including the viscosity effects believed to be the reason of the fuel injector discharge capability drop. The characterization of the Boundary Layer structure inside the swirl injector chamber under some simplifying hypotheses brought to a close form analytical solution of the viscous swirler problem. Thus, further cold flow tests were planned and conducted in order to verify the validity of the obtained solution: the test results matched with great accuracy the predictions of the built viscous model over a wide range of measurements, leading to the assessment of the enhanced injector flow model and the building of the operative map for both injectors. This gave the possibility to design the flight version injectors meeting the baselined requirements. The definition of the flight version combustion chamber head also started considering the analysis of the current project process: the interface nature of this element forced its design to be subject to several constraints coming from the other subsystems development. The optimization process of the flight version focused on the choice of the combination of geometric and material features of the designed concept, facing the compromise between weight saving and thermal-structural integrity. The use of lightweight materials such Aluminum alloys seemed to be the most promising solution for a lightweight design and an active cooling strategy has been implemented in order for the lightweight structure to withstand the thermal loads coming from combustion. A thermal model has been built for the convective heat transfer of burning gases and coolant beside the injector plate and coupled with a structural analysis, through which the optimum “leading thickness” of the structure has been obtained as the outcome of a thermal/stress analytical optimization, then validated through the use of FEM codes. Tuned the interface features together with the other mattering subsystems, a final lightweight design has been assessed with the choice of a High Temperature Aluminum Alloy, ready to be manufactured and capable of satisfying both thermal-structural and interface requirements...|$|E

Using a plasmid-based microinjection assay with Xenopus laevis oocytes, {{we show that}} the heterologous Drosophila melanogaster scs and scs' insulator elements do not require chromosomal context to block enhancer-activated transcription. A single insulator element partially blocks enhancer-activated transcription, indicating that each element operates independently rather than {{as part of a}} pair.

The scs and scs' sequences do not block site-specific recombination by FLP recombinase, implying that insulators do not operate by a general mechanism that physically sequesters the DNA.

40|$|Abstract. Powder {{injection}} molding (MicroPIM) has a considerable {{potential for the}} production of high-value metal and ceramic micro components. This does not only apply to technical aspects but, due to the deployability of mass production, also to economic ones. The current status can be summed up by the following key data: latest trials revealed smallest struc-tural details in the 10 µm range or lower. Theoretical densities of up to 99 % were achieved depend-ing on the particular powder applied. Typical materials processed are metals (Fe, Cu, 316 L, 17 - 4 PH, W and W-alloys etc.) or ceramics (aluminum/zirconium oxide etc.). Best surface qualities were obtained with ultrafine or even nano-doped ceramic powders. Another major line of development is multi-component or <b>assembly</b> <b>injection</b> molding. These proc-esses do not only reduce assembly expenditure, but also allow for the use of new functional material combinations. Interesting examples are ceramic micro heating elements or gear wheel/shaft samples which can be performed as fixed or movable combinations. Micro inmold-labelling using PIM feed-stocks offers further promising opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an <b>assembly</b> <b>injection</b> process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with rounded edges and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the rounded edges are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of rounded edges is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry. In addition the effect of rounded edges on stress distribution of overmoulded parts is analysed by combining resulting geometries of the forming simulation with the numerical analysis of stress distribution within the polymer...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} high intensity, pulsed, optically pumped, far-infrared (FIR) lasers. The work was motivated by {{the need for a}} radiation source for the measurement of the ion temperature in magnetically confined, high temperature plasmas (e. g. tokamak plasmas), using Thomson scattering. Constraints imposed by the plasma parameters, the scattering geometry and available detector sensitivities lead to the requirement of a radiation source wavelength between 30 andnbsp;andmu;m and 1 andnbsp;mm and a source power and#x 2273;andnbsp; 1 MW in a bandwidth and#x 2272;andnbsp; 60 andnbsp;MHz. Results are presented for a 496 andnbsp;andmu;m, 500 andnbsp;watt, methyl fluoride (CH 3 F) cavity laser, with a bandwidth of andlt;andnbsp; 30 andnbsp;MHz, which was optically pumped by a 9. 55 andnbsp;andmu;m CO 2 laser. Results are also presented for an optically excited mirrorless, super-radiant, CH 3 F laser, which generated over 0. 6 andnbsp;MW of FIR radiation within a bandwidth of about 300 andnbsp;MHz. The performance of this laser has also been simulated by a computer model, which allows the optimum operating parameters to be predicted. An assembly constructed on the principle of the injection laser, in which low power narrow-band oscillator radiation is used to control the output of a super-radiant system, has been used to generate 250 kW of 496 andmu;m radiation, with a bandwidth of andlt;andnbsp; 60 andnbsp;MHz. Investigations of the FIR output from heavy water vapour (D 2 O) in a super-radiant laser assembly, optically excited by several different CO 2 laser wavelengths, have resulted in the generation of 60 andnbsp;ns (FWHM) pulses of FIR radiation with average powers of 1. 3, 9. 2 and 15. 8 andnbsp;MW, at wavelengths of 385, 119 and 66 andnbsp;andmu;m, respectively. All these lasers were found to have a higher CO 2 to FIR photon conversion efficiency than the 496 andnbsp;andmu;m CH 3 F laser. In addition, the energy level spacing in D 2 O is such that the molecule can generate narrow bandwidth radiation more readily than the CH 3 F molecule.
