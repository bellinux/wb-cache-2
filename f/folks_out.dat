I don't think they had many estimable qualities {{from your point of}} view, but if they all didn't go quite straight they never went slow, and they had a few prejudices, which is why I found it advisable to leave the old country. Still, I've had my fill of all that life can offer most <b>folks</b> <b>out</b> here, while you scarcely seem to have found virtue pay you.

Well--thut sorter lets the old <b>folks</b> <b>out.</b> Then my brother was onc't drowned in the North Platt, and I never had any sisters.

We <b>folks</b> <b>out</b> here {{like to see the}} young people sparkin'. Your young man is a fine-appearin' chap. I felt certain you was sweethearts, for all you allowed you'd known him only a few days. Lize Davis said she saw he was sweet on you. I like his face. Jake, my man, says as how he'll make a good husband for you, and he'll take to the frontier like a duck does to water. I'm sorry you'll not tarry here awhile. We don't see many lasses, especially any as pretty as you, and you'll find it more quiet and lonesome the farther West you get. Jake knows all about Fort Henry, and Jeff Lynn, the hunter outside, he knows Eb and Jack Zane, and Wetzel, and all those Fort Henry men. You'll be gettin' married out there, won't you?" ...|$|E
