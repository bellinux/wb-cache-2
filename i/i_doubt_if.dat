Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E

500|$|Setting {{the opera}} in Japan, an exotic locale {{far away from}} Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British {{politics}} and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution." [...] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> {{there is a single}} joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth."

[...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Saint-Quentin on 2October, No.2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape. Because the AircoDH.5s in the squadron were handicapped as fighters by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in ground support duties. During the Battle of Cambrai that commenced on 20November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high. After visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard described its airmen as [...] "really magnificent" [...] while Charles Bean, war correspondent and future editor of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, commented on their [...] "remarkably high level of conduct and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the battle, prompting General Sir William Birdwood to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16December, declaring: [...] "...This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one of which I am sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> it has been beaten anywhere..." [...] By this time, No.2 Squadron had begun converting to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather. Watt himself, now almost forty, was beginning to show the strain of frontline command. Bean found him looking [...] "very worn" [...] and noticed him shivering even while seated {{in front of the}} mess hall fire.|$|E
500|$|Hogan's {{obituary}} stated that, at {{some point}} in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. [...] Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan [...] "lowered the base-running record" [...] in 1895, noting that [...] "he distance around the bases is 120 yards". [...] In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him". [...] The report added, [...] "Under proper conditions [...] turned the route in 13 15 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895". [...] Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. [...] In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that [...] "Hogan was a great sprinter" [...] but described his unofficial record as [...] "out of reason". [...] Grillo, who argued that [...] "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. [...] An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. [...] In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most [...] "authentic" [...] record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. [...] The article stated that, while Hogan was [...] "said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 25 seconds by a fifth of a second", this alleged feat was not [...] "performed under official sanction". [...] One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. [...] According to an article that appeared in [...] Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. [...] "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. [...] "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4". [...] The retired player added: [...] "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>if</b> he could". [...] For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record [...] "in Indianapolis in the 80's".) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, [...] "disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records". [...] The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. [...] Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the [...] "Indianapolis Ringer". [...] Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. [...] On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had [...] "a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "A race between the two is talked of". [...] Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. [...] "The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card", the article added. [...] "Indianapolis goes around the land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. [...] He has not yet been defeated". [...] Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: [...] "Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap".|$|E

Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used.

2500|$|Leavis' {{appraisal}} {{of it has}} been hailed as the beginning of the critical consensus that still exists towards the novel, in which it is recognised not only as Eliot's finest work but also {{as one of the greatest}} novels in English.

In his review for Sports Illustrated, Steve Wulf wrote, [...] "It's a good movie and a damn good baseball movie". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "The people associated with Bull Durham know the game ... and the firsthand experience shows in their easy command of the ballplayer's vernacular, in their feel for what goes through a batter's head when he digs in at the plate and in {{their knowledge of the}} secret ceremonies that take place on the mound".
