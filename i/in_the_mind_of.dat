5|$|It {{may be that}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols {{were never}} meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics.

Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American political and economic elite, and certainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officials of the Bush administration, the growth of Islamic terrorism has become the cause of the growth of the American Empire. As it happens, both causal theories are probably correct...|$|R

5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played over {{three days and}} culminated in a draw on Saturday, 27 July.

Gloucestershire responded with 116, Grace making the top score of 32. At close of play on the second day, Lancashire had made 90–0 with Hornby on 68 and Barlow on 15; and {{the legend of the}} run stealers was born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the watching Francis Thompson. Hornby and Barlow put on 108 for the first wicket and then Barlow was out for 26. Hornby went on to score exactly 100 and Lancashire's total was 262 (Grace 1–65). Gloucestershire scored 125–5 in the last innings with Grace, batting at six, on 58 not out at the close.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago.

Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as {{he was forced to}} make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
5|$|Inside Out is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama {{adventure}} film, co-written {{and directed}} by Pete Docter. The film is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a young girl named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she moves to a new city and has to adjust to her new life. After premiering it at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures released the film theatrically in the United States on June 19, 2015. Made on a production budget of $175 million, Inside Out grossed a worldwide total of $857 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2015 and the 49th highest-grossing film of all time as of July 2016. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 317 reviews and judged 98% to be positive.|$|E
40|$|According to Eugene Nida’s {{theory of}} Dynamic Equivalence, the most {{important}} aim for translators should be to achieve equivalence in effect between original and translated text. Equivalent effect is achieved when a translated text creates the same associations and feelings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> its readers as was produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readers of the original text. Venuti argues that equivalent effect can only be achieved using what {{he refers to as}} ethnocentric domesticating strategies – placing <b>the</b> text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the target audience. He claims that a foreignizing strategy – placing <b>the</b> reader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the original text – is more appropriate. Consequently, equivalent effect is, in his view, a poor guiding principle for translation. In this thesis, I challenge Venuti’s view that only domesticating strategies can achieve equivalent effect in translation. Using a response-oriented method, I measure the associations to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> respondents from <b>the</b> source audience. Then, I compare these associations with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> readers of two translations of AAVE – one using a domesticating strategy to translate AAVE, and one using a moderate foreignizing strategy. In contrast to Venuti’s assertions, I find that the moderate foreignizing strategy produces associations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target readers that are more <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source readers than the domesticating strategy...|$|R

5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids {{any other kind}} of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
