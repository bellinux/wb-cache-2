40|$|AbstractThe new Egyptian Code (ECP- 201 : 2012) {{introduces}} new vehicular {{live loads}} (VLL) and new load combinations {{for the design}} of roadway bridges. The new VLL and load combinations introduced in ECP- 201 : 2012 are fundamentally different than those presented in previous versions of the code. The impact of these new loads and load combinations on the design of new bridges or the structural safety of the existing bridges that have been designed according to ECP- 201 : 2003 or ECP- 201 : 1993 has not been fully addressed for the different bridge deck systems. Three different bridge deck systems, i. e. concrete I-shaped girders, composite steel plate girders, and concrete box-girders with different spans were numerically modeled using two-dimensional grillage analogy. The bridge decks were analyzed under main gravity loads using VLL according to ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003. The internal forces of individual load cases, total un-factored load combination, and total <b>factored</b> <b>load</b> combination of ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003 were compared. The study shows that concrete box-girders designed according to ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003 using the ultimate limit state method yield almost the same demand. Despite the increase in the VLL of ECP- 201 : 2012, and consequently the live load forces, concrete I-shaped girder bridges will be subjected to less total factored internal forces in comparison to ECP- 201 : 2003 This is attributed to the interaction between the live to dead loads ratio and the load combinations. Design of composite steel plate girder bridges according to ECP- 201 : 2012 using the allowable stress design method yields over designed sections...|$|E

40|$|While the {{expansive}} corrosion of steel reinforcement {{is a major}} concern in reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs, the non-corrosive fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars provide an excellent alternative reinforcement. This thesis investigates the behaviour of restrained concrete bridge deck slabs reinforced with different types and ratios of FRP reinforcing bars under static loading conditions. The research includes two different phases; experimental and theoretical investigations. In the experimental phase, nine full-scale deck slabs 3000 -mm long × 2500 -mm wide × 200 -mm deep were constructed and tested to failure. Five deck slabs were reinforced with glass FRP bars, two deck slabs were reinforced with carbon FRP bars, one deck slab was reinforced with steel bars, and the last deck slab was constructed without any reinforcement (plain concrete). The deck slabs were supported on two steel girders spaced at 2000 -mm centre-to-centre and were subjected to a monotonic single concentrated load over a contact area of 600 mm x 250 mm to simulate the foot print of a sustained truck wheel load (87. 5 kN - CL- 625 Truck) acting on the centre of each slab. The experimental results were presented in terms of cracking, deflection, strains in concrete and reinforcement, ultimate capacity and mode of failure. It was observed that the mode of failure for all reinforced deck slabs was punching shear with carrying capacities of {{more than three times the}} design <b>factored</b> <b>load</b> specified by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). It was also concluded that the maximum measured crack widths and deflections at service load level were below the allowable code limits. The theoretical phase has two parts. The first part includes developing a finite element model (FEM) to analyze and predict the behaviour of bridge deck slabs reinforced with FRP reinforcement. The efficiency and accuracy of the computer model was verified by comparing its results to the experimental results. Then the FEM was used to conduct a parametric study on the most important parameters that are known to affect the behaviour of the deck slabs. In addition the finite element program was used to analyze a typical concrete bridge reinforced with GFRP bars. The second part of the theoretical phase includes developing a new punching shear model to predict the punching shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs. The proposed model can predict with good accuracy the punching capacity of FRP-reinforced bridge deck slabs as well as FRP-reinforced two way slabs. In addition, the proposed model gives better predictions compared to the different available punching shear models...|$|E
40|$|Precast {{prestressed}} concrete panels {{have been used}} as subdecks in bridge construction in Iowa and other states. To investigate the performance of these types of composite slabs at locations adjacent to abutment and pier diaphragms in skewed bridges, a research prcject which involved surveys of design agencies and precast producers, field inspections of existing bridges, analytical studies, and experimental testing was conducted. The survey results from the design agencies and panel producers showed that standardization of precast panel construction would be desirable, that additional inspections at the precast plant and at the bridge site would be beneficial, and that some form of economical study should be undertaken to determine actual cost savings associated with composite slab construction. Three bridges in Hardin County, Iowa were inspected to observe general geometric relationships, construction details, and to note the visual condition of the bridges. Hairline cracks beneath several of the prestressing strands in many of the precast panels were observed, and a slight discoloration of the concrete was seen beneath most of the strands. Also, some rust staining was visible at isolated locations on several panels. Based on the findings of these inspections, future inspections are recommended to monitor the condition of these and other bridges constructed with precast panel subdecks. Five full-scale composite slab specimens were constructed in the Structural Engineering Laboratory at Iowa State University. One specimen modeled bridge deck conditions which are not adjacent to abutment or pier diaphragms, and the other four specimens represented the geometric conditions which occur for skewed diaphragms of 0, 15, 30, and 40 degrees. The specimens were subjected to wheel loads of service and factored level magnitudes at many locations on the slab surface and to concentrated loads which produced failure of the composite slab. The measured slab deflections and bending strains at both service and <b>factored</b> <b>load</b> levels compared reasonably well with the results predicted by simplified Finite element analyses of the specimens. To analytically evaluate the nominal strength for a composite slab specimen, yield-line and punching shear theories were applied. Yield-line limit loads were computed using the crack patterns generated during an ultimate strength test. In most cases, these analyses indicated that the failure mode was not flexural. Since the punching shear limit loads in most instances were close to the failure loads, and since the failure surfaces immediately adjacent to the wheel load footprint appeared to be a truncated prism shape, the probable failure mode for all of the specimens was punching shear. The development lengths for the prestressing strands in the rectangular and trapezoidal shaped panels was qualitatively investigated by monitoring strand slippage at the ends of selected prestressing strands. The initial strand transfer length was established experimentally by monitoring concrete strains during strand detensioning, and this length was verified analytically by a finite element analysis. Even though the computed strand embedment lengths in the panels were not sufficient to fully develop the ultimate strand stress, sufficient stab strength existed. Composite behavior for the slab specimens was evaluated by monitoring slippage between a panel and the topping slab and by computation of the difference in the flexural strains between the top of the precast panel and the underside of the topping slab at various locations. Prior to the failure of a composite slab specimen, a localized loss of composite behavior was detected. The static load strength performance of the composite slab specimens significantly exceeded the design load requirements. Even with skew angles of up to 40 degrees, the nominal strength of the slabs {{did not appear to be}} affected when the ultimate strength test load was positioned on the portion of each slab containing the trapezoidal-shaped panel. At service and factored level loads, the joint between precast panels did not appear to influence the load distribution along the length of the specimens. Based on the static load strength of the composite slab specimens, the continued use of precast panels as subdecks in bridge deck construction is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods.

However, this approach is possible to lead biased biological inferences because these metabolites are not objectively selected by statistical criterion.

The number of factors imbedded in the population was a component in six interactions that resulted in medium effect size differences in measures of agreement between population and sample <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrices. of <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> sensitivity, general pattern agreement, per element agreement, congruence, factor score correlations, and <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> bias; {{in terms of the number}} of interactions that yielded at least medium effect size differences in measures of sensitivity, agreement, and congruence. The number of factors design factor exerted a larger influence than any of the other design factors. The level of communality interacted with the number of factors, number of observed variables, and sample size main effects to yield at least medium effect size differences in <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> sensitivity, general pattern agreement, per element agreement, congruence, factor score correlations, <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> bias, and RMSE; in terms of the number of factors that included communality as a component, this design factor exerted the second largest amount of influence on the measures of sensitivity, agreement, and congruence. The level of dichotomization, sample size, and number of observed variables were included in smaller numbers of interactions; however, these interactions yielded differences in all of the outcome variables that were at least medium in effect size. Across the majority of interactions among the manipulated research contexts, the ordinary least squares factor extraction method yielded <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrices that were in better agreement with the population than either the maximum likelihood or the principal axis methods. In three of the four measures of congruence, the ordinary least squares method yielded <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrices that exhibited less bias and error than the other two tested factor extraction methods. In general, the ordinary least squares method yielded <b>factor</b> <b>loading</b> matrices that correlated more strongly with the population than either of the other two tested methods. The suggested use of ordinary least squares factor analytic techniques represents the major, empirically derived recommendation derived from the results of this study. In all tested conditions, the ordinary least squares factor extraction method identified common factors with a high degree of efficacy. Suggested studies for future would incorporate the limiting constraints associated with this dissertation into methodological studies to extend the generalizability of conclusions and recommendations into areas that are beyond the scope of this dissertation...|$|R
