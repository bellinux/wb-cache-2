40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop an algorithm to solve difficulty associated with spring back error in sheet metal <b>forming.</b> <b>Spring</b> back can be considered as a dimensional change which happens during unloading, due to the occurrence of primarily elastic recovery of the material. The die surface compensation is needed to obtain the accurate product due to geometrical deviations caused by spring back. Die-compensation simulation enables companies to increase competitiveness by increasing product accuracy and reducing the number of errors in sheet metal forming process. The proposed algorithm combines two methods of die compensation; Displacement Adjustment (DA) and Spring-Forward (SF) methods. Both are based on iteratively comparing the deformed shape with the target...|$|E

It is caused by erosion processes, mass wasting intensively, Lawu fault and other faults. Most springs flow on the volcanic slope and volcanic foot morphology...|$|E

40|$|D 321 was {{the first}} of three National Oceanography Centre ‘process study ’ {{research}} cruises to be run by the Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems research group under the NERC Oceans 2025 research programme. The scientific work began by carrying out some of the extended Ellett Line stations on the way out to our study region; which centred around the historical JGOFS Ocean Weather Station India site (~ 59 ° N, ~ 19 ° W) and the northward turn of the extended Ellett line at 20 ° W. The Iceland Basin, like much of the N. Atlantic subpolar gyre, is characterised by a ‘bloom and bust ’ seasonal cycle. Spring stratification triggers a major diatom dominated bloom event. This bloom is short lived, limited by silicate (orthosilicic acid) exhaustion (Brown et al., 2003). Two community succession pathways commonly follow the demise of the diatom bloom; typically through dinoflagellate and/or coccolithophore production. The spring bloom is dominated by eddy scale (several 10 's of km) patchiness, driven by the upward and downward pumping effect of eddies on the newly <b>forming</b> <b>spring</b> stratification. However these eddy structures have another, more important, impact on phytoplankton production (Allen et al., 2005). In the release of potential energy...|$|E
40|$|Between 28 November 1985 and 14 February 1986, over 2, 500 waterfowl, 48 Wild Turkeys, and {{at least}} one Bald Eagle died due to avian cholera in an area from 5 miles west of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, to 5 miles west of Lingle, Wyoming. On 28 November a severe {{snowstorm}} blanketed the North Platte River valley with 10 inches of snow and wind chills of – 20 °F. An estimated 50, 000 Mallards were concentrated 5 miles west of Scottsbluff, at the headwaters of Spring Creek. The area consists of 2 small dredged channels, 10 feet wide and less than 3 feet deep, and surrounded by 20 -feet high willow trees. The spring water flows at 55 °F, <b>forming</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek, which is approximately 5 feet wide, 1 foot deep, and flows nearly 3 miles to the North Platte River. Fifteen Mallard carcasses were collected 28 November. Postmortem diagnosis by the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC), Madison, Wisconsin, confirmed Pasteurella multicocida (avian cholera) as the cause of death. US Fish and Wildlife Service personnel from Crescent Lake NWR and Nebraska Game and Parks personnel collected carcasses at triweekly intervals over the next 2. 5 months. A total of 1, 500 waterfowl were incinerated, with over l, 200 being Mallards. Other species collected were Pintail, American Wigeon, a Black-billed Magpie, a Common Grackle, a Bald Eagle, domestic fowl, and Wild Turkeys. Total mortalities were estimated at more than 2, 500 waterfowl. By 1 December, 60 Mallards had been collected, and the first eagles were seen feeding on carcasses (2 adult Bald Eagles and 2 Golden Eagles). One week later, 4 adult and 5 immature Bald Eagles were observed...|$|E

However these eddy structures have another, more important, impact on phytoplankton production (Allen et al., 2005). In the release of potential energy, eddies effect a real three dimensional exchange of water across the thermocline bringing new dissolved nutrients from deeper waters up into the photic zone and transporting biogenic particles into the deep ocean. Thin ribbon like structures around the edges of eddies are clearly seen in ocean colour satellite images. The four repeated surveys carried out during D 321 observed the evolution of an ‘eddy dipole’ in a background ocean full of eddies and other turbulent motions. Daily, near real-time, satellite images and in-situ vessel mounted acoustic current profiling were used to determine the movement of the eddy centres and the dipole central jet. Targeted nets and water collection within the various components of the eddy dipole enabled the assessment of its biological impacts. Since 1996 NOCS and SAMS have been occupying an extended version of the Ellett Line that runs all the way to Iceland. The Extended Ellett line is important oceanographically because it completes the measurements of the warm saline water flowing into the Nordic Seas from the eastern North Atlantic. It also monitors around half of the returning deep and cold current, the overflow water (the rest returns to the Atlantic via the Denmark Strait to the west of Iceland). There is little added cost, either in time or financially, in making a number of biogeochemical measurements using water samples from the hydrographers' CTD stations. Thus, recently, the scientific interests in the Extended Ellett line have become more multidisciplinary; the 2006 occupation was no exception. Samples were filtered for POC, HPLC studies and trace aluminium concentration determination, in addition some extra time was found for a number of zooplankton net hauls. <br/...|$|E
