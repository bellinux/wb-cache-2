2500|$|Although Nietzsche has famously been {{misrepresented}} as a predecessor to Nazism, {{he criticized}} anti-Semitism, pan-Germanism and, {{to a lesser}} extent, nationalism. Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with Richard Wagner, expressed in The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche Contra Wagner, both of which he wrote in 1888, {{had much to do}} with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism [...] and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to Theodor Fritsch, Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, Eugen Dühring, Wagner, Ebrard, Wahrmund, and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, Paul de Lagarde, who would become, along with Wagner and Houston Chamberlain, the main official influences of Nazism. This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: [...] "-- And finally, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites? ..." ...|$|E

You've been mighty good to me. I've never met a man who treated me like you. You're the only real white man that's ever {{happened}} to me, and I guess I'm {{not going to play}} you a low-down trick like spoiling your life. George, I thought you knew. Honest, I thought <b>you</b> knew. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I lived in a swell place like this, if <b>you</b> didn't know? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> suppose everyone knew me at Rector's? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'd managed to find out so much about Winfield Knight?
