5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit <b>his</b> <b>vision.</b> Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> of the 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film.

In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> {{invariably}} concerned {{the welfare of}} the Boere, the Netherlands and Germany, and were experienced by him as visual imagery to be interpreted afterwards. When the image of the sisal plant occurred in <b>his</b> <b>visions,</b> he for instance interpreted this as a portent of an important meeting, assembly or parliament. He is believed by some to have made many accurate predictions of local events, including foretelling the death of general Koos de la Rey and the political transition of South Africa after his own death. At times <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> also concerned international events, among which the start of World War I and the rise of Communism. He was unable to interpret some of <b>his</b> own <b>visions.</b> These, written down, are still open to interpretation, and believed by some to pertain to future events.|$|R

However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals.

5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed {{his belief in the}} equality of sexes, yet <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> was one of gender difference and complementarity between them.

His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E
