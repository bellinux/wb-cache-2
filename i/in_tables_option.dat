40|$|We {{introduce}} a recently published corpus-based database of German clause-embedding predicates and present an innovative web application for exploring it. The application displays the predicates and the corpus examples for these predicates <b>in</b> two separate <b>tables</b> {{that can be}} browsed and searched in real time. While familiar web interface paradigms {{make it easy for}} users to get started, the data presentation and the interactive advanced search components for the two tables are designed to accommodate remarkably complex query needs without the need for resorting to a dedicated query language or a more specialized tool. The 1 :n relationship between predicates and their examples is exploited <b>in</b> the two <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> that, e. g. the predicate table also shows, for each predicate and each example attribute, all values that occur in the examples for this predicate. An easy-to-use visual query builder for arbitrary Boolean combinations of search criteria can optionally be displayed to pre-filter the underlying data presented <b>in</b> both <b>tables.</b> Several <b>options</b> for altering quantifier scope can be activated with simple checkboxes and considerably widen the space of searchable constellations...|$|R

40|$|Odors {{coming off}} a beef feeding {{operation}} are generated from three different sources: the feedlot facility, waste storage, and the land where the manure is applied. In some operations, the feedlot facility may also serve as the primary waste storage area. To reduce {{the total amount of}} odor generated from a beef feeding operation, odor generation and emission by each of these three sources needs to be reduced. Several options for odor reduction are available in each area. Only practices that are proven to be effective and that can be immediately implemented in new and existing facilities are listed <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1. Other <b>options</b> are currently being developed or tested; continued research will reveal whether they can be successfully implemented in the future. The <b>table</b> is organized <b>in</b> four sections covering practices to reduce odor generation, reduce odor emission from facilities and storage units, increase odor dispersion, and reduce odor emission from manure application. For each practice, advantages and disadvantages are listed. The effectiveness and the cost of implementing each practice are indicated using odor generation from a standard beef feeding operation as a base line. The base line operation is assumed to be dirt-lot with no slope, no additional manure storage structure, and no dietary modifications to reduce odor generation. The effectiveness of each practice is indicated as “low, ” “moderate, ” or “high. ” A low effectiveness i...|$|R

Some parameters such as plasma density, electron temperature, ion temperature, and total electron content were considered for 300 -km altitude. One of the reasons for chosen electron density, in particular, at the height of 300 km is that ionospheric plasma at the F-region (altitude 300 km) is basically a low collision region (Ridley et al., 2006). Another reason is that the height centered around 300 km incidentally happens to be transition region from chemically controlled to transport dominated F-region (Oyekola, 2009 b and references therein). Hence, it is easy to correlate the effect of vertical drifts with the electron density at a specific height and time.|$|R
