5|$|Hugh {{obtained}} {{an exemption}} allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his castle at Northallerton in Yorkshire when Henry was ordering {{the destruction of}} most of the illegal castles that had been built during King Stephen's reign.

5|$|Montserrat Carulla as Benigna Escobeda, {{a former}} worker at the orphanage who {{identifies}} {{herself as a}} social worker. When she is seen young in the film, she is portrayed by Carol Suárez. Production companies working with Bayona tried to urge <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this character alive {{until the end of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The deputy sheriff's {{position}} was {{worth more than}} US$40,000 a year (about $ today) because he was also county assessor and tax collector, {{and the board of}} supervisors allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> 10% of the amounts paid. While Wyatt was deputy sheriff, former Democrat state legislator Johnny Behan arrived in September 1880.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as {{his running}} mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey {{campaign}} asked Sanford {{if he wanted to}} be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined, and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position that would allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his political prospects open.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jesse and {{his parents}} visit the Burke family home to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that she loved him, and thanks him for being {{a very good friend}} to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, but his father consoles <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their friendship alive for her sake.|$|E

5|$|When Marsh {{responded to}} Lakes, {{he paid the}} {{prospector}} $100, urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the finds a secret. Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope, Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes' services. Marsh published a description of Lakes' discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1, and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds, Lakes wrote {{to him that the}} bones should be shipped to Marsh, a severe insult to Cope.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, he would, {{just the}} same, Dan. We should {{know whether to}} go away from <b>him,</b> or <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> on the right hand or on the left." ...|$|R
5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman sent <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Wiedensahl <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|R

Clark {{eventually}} becomes an isolated young {{man as a}} result of developing superhuman powers. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world {{for an extended period of}} time under several disguises.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1943, Lukačević's Chetniks {{participated in}} Operation Kugelblitz, {{the first of}} a series of German {{operations}} alongside the 1st Mountain Division, 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, and parts of the 187th Reserve Division, the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division and the 24th Bulgarian Division. The Partisans avoided decisive engagement and the operation concluded on 18 December. Also during December, the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Sandžak, SS-Standartenführer Karl von Krempler, posted notices authorising local Serbs to join Lukačević's Chetniks. On 22 December, shortly after the conclusion of Operation Kugelblitz, Oberst (Colonel) Josef Remold issued an order of the day commending Lukačević for his enthusiasm in fighting the Partisans in the Sandžak, and allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> some of the arms he had captured.|$|E

50|$|Holden {{was rewarded}} with a new {{contract}} in December 2012 <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> at Victoria Park. He went on to make 17 league appearances in the 2012-13 season which saw <b>him</b> challenging <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the experienced left-back Evan Horwood out of the first-team.|$|R
6000|$|I lied <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{deliberately}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the delusion up. [...] "I have {{a terrible}} grinding pain in my chest," [...] I said, pretending to writhe. I had sunk to his level, it seems. I was a liar and a murderer.|$|R
5|$|Jon Snow, Sam {{and their}} party {{return to the}} Wall after finding two frozen corpses. Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points {{out that there is}} no sign of decay on their corpses, even though they have {{apparently}} been dead for weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E
5|$|Lancashire {{monitored}} MacLaren's progress {{during his}} time at Harrow. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the County Championship. Making his first-class debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against Sussex, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs {{at an average of}} 23.33. MacLaren's financial circumstances forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> working at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|Merlin {{reports to}} Camelot's {{physician}} Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's {{life when he}} falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits {{that he has had}} magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
