60|$|All {{the girls}} except me had now got their {{accustomed}} rap, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to hope I should escape.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brisher, {{by means}} of enigmatical facework, tried to make me think he had had the best of that argument, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{got through}} some jargon {{to the effect}} that I took the liberty of doubting that. That <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> That there could be no such beauty without it.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{simply a}} blind," [...] said Cray stubbornly. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than you why people persecute this house; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than you why--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have always}} given Albert's name as {{architect}} ... and always will. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> and so should you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than {{to argue}} when the English {{talk about their}} duty. So I agreed with my solicitor.|$|R
60|$|These were my words; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> After all {{my study}} of Mr. Bellairs, one {{discovery}} had been {{reserved for the}} last moment--that of his latent and essential madness.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "I {{dare say}}! I dare say they won't appear vital to you, Allen. Nothing does. And if I had told you, I {{should have been}} met with ridicule, I suppose. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>BETTER</b> than to tell; I {{respected}} myself too MUCH." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> I {{had caught}} a look now and again--an undefinable glance, which {{told me the}} whole pitiable tale. She did not love Rochez; and in the drama which we were {{preparing}} to enact the curtain would fall on his rapture and her unhappiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{interrupted}} somewhat hastily, [...] "do {{not try to}} deny it, my child; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than you can what it would amount to. Believe me, I only lend myself to her arrangement because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> no <b>better</b> means of guarding you and preserving you for better days." ...|$|R
60|$|Wild. Resist it? No; I {{would she}} would {{understand}} it; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> what belongs to {{flesh and blood}} than so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> {{now what}} you meant by owing all to Miss Charlecote,' he said, smiling. 'I owe {{something}} to her, too.' ...|$|R
60|$|Let me admit, as I {{start to}} write, {{that the whole}} thing is my own fault. I should never have come. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> I have known better for years. I have known that it is sheer madness to go and pay visits in other people's houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> I knew that when she said, over and over again, 'Is my father never coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} of somebody else. And are you come to take her away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Her {{acquaintance}} {{will begin}} earlier than mine. Do you remember showing me my first glow-worm at Beauchastel? I {{used to think}} that the gem of my walks, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> It is a great treat to have poor Walter here in the holidays, so good and pleasant; but I must say one charm is the pleasure of being alone together afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You speak thus {{simply to}} tease your poor Margot,' she said, {{pleading}} yet trembling; 'but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than {{to think you}} mean it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better,</b> Marianne. <b>I</b> have a {{suspicion}} that I could tell what the Captain was about yesterday {{when he walked}} off after dinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he does {{care for}} me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> nor you," [...] Hetty burst out. Everything was {{forgotten}} {{but the pain}} and anger she felt at Adam's words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, don't {{look at it}} i' that way, Mother," [...] said Adam, who was {{determined}} to be gentle to her to-day. [...] "I don't mean to dance--I shall only look on. And since the captain wishes me to be there, it 'ud look as if I thought <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than him to say as I'd rather not stay. And thee know'st how he's behaved to me to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} I expected. Perhaps nothing else than that special {{intensity}} of existence {{which is the}} quintessence of youthful aspirations. Whatever I expected I {{did not expect to}} be beset by hurricanes. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that. In the Gulf of Siam there are no hurricanes. But neither did I expect to find myself bound hand and foot to the hopeless extent which was revealed to me as the days went on.|$|E
6000|$|He whistled {{a signal}} {{and one of}} the herders came in: [...] "Send Pablo here," [...] he said. [...] "Now, roll up any little {{trinkets}} that you want to take with you," [...] he said a few minutes later as they were saddling the two bronchos. [...] "You can't afford to stay here and face this thing; I had no business to set you on the wrong side. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> all the time, but I liked you, and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well then,' said Walter, {{trying to}} speak gaily, 'we must {{do our best to}} make him believe that the {{separation}} is but a temporary one, after all; but as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better,</b> or dread that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better,</b> Captain Cuttle, and as I have so many reasons for regarding him with affection, and duty, and honour, I am afraid I should make but a very poor hand at that, if I tried to persuade him of it. That's my great reason for wishing you to break it out to him; and that's the first point.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{something}} in your expression, sir, but now that I can see the colour of your clothes, why of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better.</b> There's three marriages--which was it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There {{was not a}} hint of Mr. Martin. <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> now, than to {{care for}} Mr. Martin, or to be {{suspected}} of it." ...|$|R
60|$|We dined to-day at Lady Stafford's [at West-hill].[403] Lord S. {{looks very}} poorly, but better than I expected. No company, {{excepting}} Sam Rogers and Mr. Grenville,[404]--the latter {{is better known}} {{by the name of}} Tom Grenville--a very amiable and accomplished man, whom <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> about twenty years since. Age has touched him, as it has doubtless affected me. The great lady received us with the most cordial kindness, and expressed herself, I am sure, sincerely, desirous to be of service to Sophia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{was quite}} a young boy,' said Uriah, 'I got to know what umbleness did, and I took to it. I ate umble pie with an appetite. I stopped at the umble point of my learning, and says I, [...] "Hold hard!" [...] When you offered to teach me Latin, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> [...] "People like to be above you," [...] says father, [...] "keep {{yourself}} down." [...] I am very umble to the present moment, Master Copperfield, but I've got a little power!' ...|$|E
6000|$|About a {{week later}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> still. It came about thus. By that time the turnips I have mentioned, those that grew in the big field, had swelled into fine, large bulbs with leafy tops. We used to eat them at nights, and in the daytime to lie up among them in our snug forms. You know, Mahatma, don't you, that a form is a little hollow which a hare makes in the ground just to fit itself? No hare likes to sleep in another hare's form. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] grunted Prickly Porky. [...] "Huh! Some folks {{think my}} wits are pretty slow, but even <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than that. Put on your {{thinking}} cap again, Peter Rabbit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't tell me, Andy Graham! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better,</b> <b>I</b> do!" [...] {{the old man}} shrilled. [...] "But you {{remember}} I'm your guardeen, an' you can't sell nuthin' without me!" ...|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. Come, Mrs Knox, dont tell me Knox is a sinner. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better.</b> I'm sure youd be {{the first}} to be sorry if {{anything}} was to happen to him.|$|R
60|$|My top-mates {{thought that}} this {{remarkable}} metamorphose was the effect produced upon a weak, vain character suddenly elevated from {{the level of a}} mere seaman to the dignified position of a petty officer. But though, in similar cases, I had seen such effects produced upon some of the crew; yet, in the present instance, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that;--it was solely brought about by his consorting with with those villainous, irritable, ill-tempered cannon; more especially from his being subject to the orders of those deformed blunderbusses, Priming and Cylinder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{what a man}} you are to ask!' cried Peg, {{with some}} contempt. 'If I had taken money from Arthur Gride, he'd have scoured the whole earth to find me--aye, and he'd have smelt it out, and raked it up, somehow, if I had buried it {{at the bottom of}} the deepest well in England. No, no! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that. I took what I thought his secrets were hid in: and them he couldn't afford to make public, let'em be worth ever so much money. He's an old dog; a sly, old, cunning, thankless dog! He first starved, and then tricked me; and if I could I'd kill him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what does}} this Willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to Myra Allison, the liveliest, brightest, keenest, smartest, and prettiest girl in San Augustine. I tell you, she had the blackest eyes, the shiniest curls, and the most tantalizing--Oh, no, you're off--I wasn't a victim. I might have been, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> I kept out. Joe Granberry was It from the start. He had {{everybody}} else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound. But, anyhow, Myra was a nine-pound, full-merino, fall-clip fleece, sacked and loaded on a four-horse team for San Antone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh good gracious!' cried Tom. 'Ours {{was made}} with flour and eggs, was it? Ha, ha, ha! A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs! Why anybody <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than that! Ha, ha, ha!' ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR SIR,--I {{desire to}} make a complaint, and I bring it to you, {{the head of the}} company, because by {{experience}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than to carry it to a subordinate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{say that}} I was favorably {{disposed}} toward that attachment at the time," [...] replied Miss Garth. [...] "I was ignorant {{then of the}} family secret: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> now." ...|$|R
