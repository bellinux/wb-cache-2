5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014.

It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat.
