Approach: Symbol timing estimation has two steps namely a coarse estimation and a fine estimation. In this study, a maximum likelihood framework for the fine timing estimation is proposed. It utilizes the delay embedded in the estimated Channel Impulse Response (CIR) obtained from the cross correlation of training sequence with the received sequence. Results: The performance of the proposed method is analyzed in terms of probability of correct timing detection. It is observed that the proposed technique has better probability of correct timing detection performance compared to the existing algorithm, in all the UWB channel models proposed by IEEE 802. 15. 3 a working group for UWB systems.

The results, presented in a format streamlined for practical use, can guide the specification for hardware fabrication of required error tolerances (for structural properties as well as member lengths), or they can aid the prediction of antenna performance if component statistics are available.
