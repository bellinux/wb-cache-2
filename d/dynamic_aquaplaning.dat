50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> is a {{relatively}} high-speed phenomenon that occurs {{when there is a}} film of water on the runway that is at least 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) deep. As the speed of the aircraft and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance to displacement, resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the aquaplaning speed (Vp), the upward force generated by water pressure equals the weight of the aircraft and the tire is lifted off the runway surface. In this condition, the tires no longer contribute to directional control, and braking action is nil. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> is generally related to tire inflation pressure. Tests have shown that for tires with significant loads and enough water depth for the amount of tread so that the dynamic head pressure from the speed is applied to the whole contact patch, the minimum speed for <b>dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> (Vp) in knots is about 9 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an aircraft tire pressure of 64 PSI, the calculated aquaplaning speed would be approximately 72 knots. This speed is for a rolling, non-slipping wheel; a locked wheel reduces the Vp to 7.7 times the square root of the pressure. Therefore, once a locked tire starts aquaplaning it will continue until the speed reduces by other means (air drag or reverse thrust).|$|E
50|$|Aquaplaning is a {{condition}} that can exist when an aircraft is landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush, and/or wet snow. Aquaplaning can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of aquaplaning are <b>dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning,</b> reverted rubber aquaplaning, and viscous aquaplaning. Any {{one of the three}} can render an aircraft partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll.|$|E
50|$|Reverted rubber {{aquaplaning}} frequently follows {{an encounter}} with <b>dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning,</b> during which time the pilot may have the brakes locked {{in an attempt to}} slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber aquaplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less).|$|E
50|$|Viscous {{aquaplaning}} {{is due to}} the viscous {{properties of}} water. A thin film of fluid no more than 0.025 mm in depth is all that is needed. The tire cannot penetrate the fluid and the tire rolls on top of the film. This can occur at a much lower speed than <b>dynamic</b> <b>aquaplane,</b> but requires a smooth or smooth-acting surface such as asphalt or a touchdown area coated with the accumulated rubber of past landings. Such a surface can have the same friction coefficient as wet ice.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this report has been to develop a numerical method for the investigation of water-lubricated soft elastohydrodynamic (EHD) conjunctions {{as it relates to}} the problem of car tyre aquaplaning. Whereas the problem of aquaplaning on very thick water films is very well-studied, the aspects of a tyre sliding on thin water layer is much less investigated. Considering fluid flow in very thin layers, one can find that the relative importance of viscosity of the fluid increases over the mass inertia effects. Therefore it is suggested in the present investigation to distinct between two different regimes of aquaplaning and refer them as <b>dynamic</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> and viscous aquaplaning. The subject of the present investigation is viscous aquaplaning on thin fluid layer. Considering flow in a thin fluid layer allows a number assumptions to be made, which brings this problem close to the problem of fluid lubrication of machine elements. This makes it possible to apply advanced numerical methods originally developed for the lubrication theory to the aquaplaning of a pneumatic car tyre on a thin layer of water. Numerical results were produced for 20, 40, 60, 120, and 200 km/h. No fluid films were detected separating the surfaces in this range of velocities...|$|E
