500|$|Very little {{information}} was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts. Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police {{once a month}} on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> place to dance. When they decided {{to make it a}} regular meeting, they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled The Ladder in 1956; inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was [...] "Education of the variant". It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality—specifically relating to women, and famous lesbians in history. However, by 1956 the term [...] "lesbian" [...] had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused {{to use it as a}} descriptor, choosing [...] "variant" [...] instead.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to {{advance the cause of}} homosexuals and provide social opportunities where gays and lesbians could socialize without fear of being arrested. Los Angeles area homosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist activist Harry Hay. Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist [...] "sexual deviants" [...] with legal troubles. Facing enormous opposition to its radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gays and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals. Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in their living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians. Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.|$|E

2500|$|United States {{labor law}} sets {{the rights and}} duties for employees, labor unions, and {{employers}} in the United States. Labor law's basic aim is to remedy the [...] "inequality of bargaining power" [...] between employees and employers, especially employers [...] "organized in the corporate {{or other forms of}} ownership association". Over the 20th century, federal law created minimum social and economic rights, and encouraged state laws to go beyond the minimum to favor employees. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires a federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 but higher in 28 states, and discourages unhealthy working weeks over 40 hours through time-and-a-half overtime pay. There are no federal or state laws requiring paid holidays or paid family leave: the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 creates a limited right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in larger employers. There is no automatic right to an occupational pension beyond federally guaranteed social security, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires standards of prudent management and good governance if employers agree to provide pensions, health plans or other benefits. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires employees <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> system of work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{restoration}} project required 205 tons of steel. Some of {{the original}} components will go on display at museums in Shanghai.

[...] Wooden sidewalks were restored {{on both sides of the}} bridge's vehicle lanes. Mao Anji, a project manager, indicated: [...] "The roadways are to be paved after the bridge is moved back to the creek. We will replace the previous concretes with wooden materials to build the new sidewalks to bring back the bridge's original and old style." [...] Additionally, [...] "some triangle-shaped frames on the bridge's two arches have been replaced with curved ones to restore the original appearance. During previous repairs, workers used the triangle structures to replace the old ones because they were easier to create than those with a curve." [...] According to the project engineers, [...] "Compared to the bridge's main structure, its underwater section has been drastically altered. Workers removed nearly 800 wooden pillars that were sunk 11 meters into the river bed. Now the bridge's three piers will be sitting on 36 one-metre-wide concrete supports that are deeply-rooted to a depth of 67 metres under the bottom of the creek." [...] The restored bridge stands on new concrete piles that are wider and deeper than the original wooden supports and is expected to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> lifespan of at least another 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|In 1869, President Grant, in an expansionist plan, {{looked into}} the {{annexation}} of a Caribbean island country, the Dominican Republic, then known as Santo Domingo. Grant believed that the mineral resources on the island would be valuable to the United States, and that African Americans repressed in the South would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> haven to which to migrate. A labor shortage in the South would force Southerners to be tolerant towards African Americans. In July and November 1869, under authority of President Grant and permission by the State Department on the second trip, Orville Babcock, private secretary to President Grant, secretly negotiated a treaty with President Buenaventura Báez, President of the Dominican Republic. [...] The initial treaty by Babcock had not been authorized by the State Department. The island nation, however, {{was on the verge}} of a civil war between President Báez and ex-President Marcos A. Cabral. President Grant sent in the U.S. Navy to keep the Dominican Republic free from invasion and civil war while the treaty negotiations took place. [...] This military action was controversial since the naval protection was unauthorized by the U.S. Congress. The official treaty, drafted by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish in October 1869, annexed the Dominican Republic to the United States, gave eventual statehood, the lease of Samaná Bay for $150,000 yearly, and a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt. In January 1870, in order to gain support for the treaty, President Grant visited Sen. Sumner's Washington home and mistakenly believed that Sumner had given consent for the treaty. [...] Sen. Sumner stated that he had only promised to give the treaty friendly consideration. This meeting would later lead to bitter contention between Sumner and Grant. The treaty was formally submitted to the United States Senate on January 10, 1870.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese Brazilian {{community}} was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without safe conduct {{issued by the}} police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco América do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations of [...] "activities against national security" [...] arising from disagreements between neighbors, recovery of debts and even fights between children. Japanese Brazilians were arrested for [...] "suspicious activity" [...] {{when they were in}} artistic meetings or picnics. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in Baixada Santista, the Japanese had to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> conduct. In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tomé-Açu, in Pará, was virtually turned into a [...] "concentration camp". This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to [...] "internment camps" [...] without the need for legal support, {{in the same manner as}} was done with the Japanese residents in the United States.
