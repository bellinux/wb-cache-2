The heat exchanger, made up of two-phase closed thermosyphons, is used for conveying heat from exhaust stream to ORC working fluid. In reality, a hot oil loop or a pressurized hot water loop or a saturated ste am loop or even a direct evaporator is often used to transfer heat from the heat source to the ORC system.

40|$|The {{broadband}} seismic data {{observed at}} Satsuma-Iwojima volcanic island in southwestern Japan show {{a wide variety}} of interesting features. One of them is the periodic and frequency-dependent amplitude modulation of volcanic tremors. Another interesting feature is the occurrence of very long period (VLP) seismic pulses synchronized with the tremor amplitude modulation. Both the tremor amplitude modulation and the VLP pulses have fairly regular intervals of 46 - 50 min, suggesting a spatially fixed, non-destructive repetitive source. We performed waveform inversions to reveal the source mechanism of the VLP pulses, assuming a point source embedded in a medium that realistically represented the topography of the island. Numerical tests showed that the Green's functions used in the inversion were significantly affected by the topography. The observed VLP pulses were well explained by the rapid expansion of an inclined crack 100 m beneath the floor of the summit crater, which had a seismic moment of 3 × 10 ^ 10 Nm. Both the characteristic amplitude modulation and the VLP pulses are explained systematically by a model consisting of a water-filled crack and a network of <b>gas</b> <b>paths.</b> The water-filled crack was heated above the boiling temperature of the water in it. A sudden break of the unstable superheated state caused sudden vaporization and a pressure increase, which was observed as the VLP pulse.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) program, nozzle-to-case joint polysulfide adhesive <b>gas</b> <b>paths</b> have occurred on several flight motors. These <b>gas</b> <b>paths</b> have allowed hot motor gases to reach the wiper O-ring. Even though these motors continue to fly safely with this condition, a desire was to reduce such occurrences. The RSRM currently uses a J-leg joint configuration on case field joints and igniter inner and outer joints. The J-leg joint configuration has been successfully demonstrated on numerous RSRM flight and static test motors, eliminating hot gas intrusion to the critical O-ring seals on these joints. Using the proven technology demonstrated on the case field joints and igniter joints, a nozzle-to-case joint J-leg design was developed for implementation on RSRM flight motors. This configuration provides an interference fit with nozzle fixed housing phenolics at assembly, with a series of pressurization gaps incorporated outboard of the joint mating surface to aid in joint pressurization and to eliminate any circumferential flow in this region. The joint insulation is bonded to the nozzle phenolics using the same pressure sensitive adhesive used in the case field joints and igniter joints. An enhancement to the nozzle-to-case joint J-leg configuration is the implementation of a carbon rope thermal barrier. The thermal barrier is located downstream of the joint bondline and is positioned within the joint in a manner where any hot gas intrusion into the joint passes through the thermal barrier, reducing gas temperatures to a level that would not affect O-rings downstream of the thermal barrier. This paper discusses the processes used in reaching a final nozzle-to-case joint J-leg design, provides structural and thermal results in support of the design, and identifies fabrication techniques and demonstrations used in arriving at the final configuration...|$|R
