Covering tissue defects follow a plan from simple to complex: primary closure, local <b>flap,</b> area <b>flap,</b> pedicle <b>flap,</b> and free <b>flap.</b> I will limit my discussion {{to the role of}} latter two. At the district-level hospital in Vietnam, pedicle <b>flaps</b> are generally more useful, so I will discuss free <b>flaps</b> only briefly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scheme to select alternative <b>flaps</b> {{limited to the}} region of the ipsilateral thigh when the perforator of the anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> is not feasible. Total of 564 consecutive microsurgery cases using anterolateral thigh perforator <b>flap</b> was reviewed from March of 2001 to January of 2009. Total of 12 cases used a contingent <b>flap</b> due to anatomical and technical complications of the anterolateral thigh perforator. The alternatives were skin perforator <b>flaps</b> adjacent to the initial <b>flap</b> (3 cases of upper anterolateral thigh <b>flap,</b> 4 cases of anteromedial thigh <b>flap),</b> vastus lateralis muscle <b>flap</b> with skin graft (2 cases), and anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> as septocutaneous <b>flap</b> without a prominent perforator on the septum (3 cases).

25|$|The phrase {{refers to}} the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the {{atmosphere}} that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can cause the tornado: {{in the sense that the}} flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: domino effect). Had the butterfly not <b>flapped</b> its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{combined}} tissues or <b>flaps</b> {{have been}} used for the repair of extensively massive or wide defects resulting from radical wide resection. To further advance the development of combined tissue transfers, they should be reclassified. Based on our cases with free tissue transfers, we have created a new classification of combined <b>flaps</b> composed of "bridge", "chimeric", "siamese", "mosaic", and "chain-circle" <b>flaps.</b> The bridge <b>flap</b> is fabricated out together of separate <b>flaps</b> with short vascular pedicles. These form a compound <b>flap</b> supplied with a solitary vascular source. The chimeric <b>flap</b> is compounded from multiple different <b>flaps</b> but consists of only a single different tissue form. Each of the <b>flaps</b> is usually supplied by different branches from the same source vessel. It differs from the bridge <b>flap</b> in that the pedicle of each <b>flap</b> or tissue has some length for its movement for transfer. The siamese connected <b>flap</b> has 2 adjacent <b>flaps</b> that are simultaneously elevated, and a disparate vascular pedicle for each <b>flap</b> must be reestablished. This connected <b>flap</b> has double isolated pedicles. Themosaic connected <b>flap</b> consists of 2 adjacent <b>flaps</b> that are simultaneously elevated, and the pedicle of the distal <b>flap</b> is anastomosed to the pedicle branch of the proximal <b>flap</b> in the "bridge" fashion. The vascular pedicle of the proximal <b>flap</b> is anastomosed to a single vascular source. The chain-circle <b>flap</b> has 2 or more <b>flaps</b> like the bridge and chimeric <b>flaps,</b> and the distal end of the vascular source is anastomosed to the branch of the recipient vessel. Based on results with our patients, the lateral circumflex femoral system seems to be the most suitable candidate for the axial pedicle of these combined <b>flaps,</b> because the system has several branches of large and small caliber, and several tissue components, such as the vascularized ilium, rectus femoris muscle, gracilis muscle, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and fascia lata, are located nearby...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background and objectives: Perforator <b>flaps,</b> both pedicled {{and free}} <b>flaps,</b> are {{increasingly}} used in reconstructive surgery. However, the microvascular perfusion pattern within these <b>flaps</b> still remains essentially unknown. It {{is well known}} that in random-pattern <b>flaps,</b> <b>flap</b> length correlates directly with the width of the <b>flap</b> base. In perforator <b>flaps,</b> the importance of preserving a skin base is still an object of debate. We hypothesized that by dividing the skin base peripheral tissue perfusion in islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> increases. The abdominal panniculus in patients submitted to elective abdominoplasty was used to test and compare perforator <b>flaps</b> (intact skin bridge at the <b>flap</b> base in addition to a single perforator) and islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> (a single perforator located {{at the base of the}} <b>flap</b> only). Methods: <b>Flap</b> perfusion was measured using dynamic laser induced fluorescence videoangiography (IC-VIEW, PULSION medical systems AG, Munich, Germany). The abdominoplasty <b>flap</b> was used to create the intended <b>flaps</b> and the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously. Special software (IC-CALC) was used for quantitative analysis. The fluorescence intensity was compared after 2 minutes of registration. The results are presented as mean ± SEM, and considered statistical significant when P < 0. 05. Results: An increase in mean pixel intensity represents an increase in tissue perfusion. After surgical release of the skin base in the perforator <b>flaps,</b> the ICG fluorescence increased in zone I (the most distal zone) in the islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> (n= 24, P< 0. 05 both compared to control and the <b>flaps</b> with skin base intact) Conclusions: Conversion of a perforator <b>flap</b> with skin base intact into an islanded perforator <b>flap</b> by dividing the skin base increases distal tissue perfusion.

40|$|<b>Flapping</b> wing {{propulsion}} has {{the potential}} to revolutionise the field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), but {{little is known about the}} effect of <b>flapping</b> motion on the performance of <b>flapping</b> wings. Prototype MAVs have achieved flight with passive <b>flapping</b> wings moving in a sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion, but the possible benefits of alternative <b>flapping</b> motions have not been studied in detail. This thesis presents the development of an Integrated Testing System (ITS), which allows the evaluation of <b>flapping</b> wing performance for different <b>flapping</b> motions. A detailed parametric study of the effect of <b>flapping</b> motion on wing performance is performed, and the optimal <b>flapping</b> motion for several passive <b>flapping</b> wings is determined by hardware-in-the-loop optimisation of two wing performance metrics. The developed ITS was able to automatically test a variety of passive <b>flapping</b> wings, and demonstrated precise control of the <b>flapping</b> motion and accurate and repeatable measurements of average lift force, mechanical power, and wing twist angle. The parametric study revealed that of the three <b>flapping</b> motions tested, the sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion generated the highest lift force, but a smoothed triangular motion was able to generate lift significantly more efficiently under load. The optimal <b>flapping</b> motion was successfully determined for three <b>flapping</b> wings, and was found to increase the loaded efficiency of the wings by an average of 31 % over a sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion. The determined optimal motion was almost identical for the three tested wings, and was found to strongly resemble the <b>flapping</b> motion of insects These findings demonstrate that significant improvements in the performance of passive <b>flapping</b> wings can be achieved by relatively minor variations of the <b>flapping</b> motion. This increased understanding will ideally lead to more efficient <b>flapping</b> wing MAVs with higher payloads, longer flight times, and improved performance...|$|R
