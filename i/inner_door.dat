25|$|At {{the lower}} {{position}} {{the process was}} reversed. Here the water pressure {{was strong enough to}} press the box tightly into position against the exit opening. Another rack and pinion (again operated from above) lifted the outer gate, the levels were equalised again, the <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> on the box was swung open and the boat floated out. Apart from the inevitable small leakages, no significant amount of water had been used in the process.|$|E

500|$|The arched <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> of {{the porch}} (which was added by Kennedy in 1867), with its [...] "ornate hinges", leads into the north-west corner of the nave. Inside, the 19th-century roof with its exposed {{woodwork}} can be seen above the nave and chancel, which together measure 40feet 3inches by 16ft 9inches (12.3 by 5.1m). There is no structural division between them, apart from two steps that lead up into the chancel. The 17th-century chapel is {{on the south side}} of the church, and the wooden trusses of its roof can also be seen. There are external buttresses to support the structure at the north-east corner and alongside the porch.|$|E
500|$|The church's {{entrance}} is an arched outer doorway in the porch, with a 15th-century pointed <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> {{set in a}} square frame described by one architectural guide as [...] "boldly moulded". The roof of the porch reuses medieval wood. The nave, which has five bays, measures 59feet 6inches by 16feet 9inches (18.1 by 5.1m). A gallery at the west end is supported by two oak crossbeams, one of which has the date of 1777 inscribed. According to one 19th-century writer, an old rood loft had previously rested {{on one of the}} beams supporting the gallery. The late-medieval internal roof timbers are exposed. The chancel, which is , is raised two steps above the nave and is separated from it by a Victorian pointed arch; there is also a Victorian arch between the nave and the north transept. The second of the three steps leading up from the chancel to the sanctuary at the east end is decorated with encaustic tiles, with the Welsh words [...] ("Wash my passion away with innocence at the altar of the Lord here").|$|E

It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs {{similar to those used}} in racecar construction. Alcoa aluminum is used for the hood, trunk lid and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminum front shock towers and <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> structures. Outer body panels are stamped using multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front crossmember/radiator support.|$|E
5000|$|A purely {{utilitarian}} use of vestibules {{in modern}} buildings {{is to create}} an [...] "air lock" [...] entry.

2500|$|Teague {{worked on}} the design of the 1975 AMC Pacer, the first car with cab forward design. It was also the first 'wide-small' {{automobile}} that [...] "gave drivers the impression they were driving a conventional large American." [...] Its [...] "styling was different and appealing in an offbeat sort of way" [...] featuring large amounts of glass. The Pacer's low beltline prevented the side door window from lowering completely out of sight, so Teague designed the <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> panels with large bolsters."

2500|$|White {{designed}} {{a number of}} other New York mansions as well, including the Iselin family estate [...] "All View" [...] and [...] "Four Chimneys" [...] in New Rochelle. [...] White was also active designing country estate homes in Greenwich, Connecticut. Examples there include the Seaman-Brush House (1900), now the Stanton House Inn, a bed and breakfast. In New York's Hudson Valley, he designed the 1896 Mills Mansion in Staatsburg. Among his [...] "cottages" [...] in Newport, Rhode Island, at Rosecliff (for Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs, 1898–1902) he adapted Mansart's Grand Trianon, but provided this house built for receptions, dinners, and dances with fluent spatial planning and well-contrived dramatic internal views en filade. His [...] "informal" [...] shingled cottages usually featured double corridors for separate circulation, so that a guest never bumped into a laundress with a basket of bed linens. Bedrooms were characteristically separated from hallways by a dressing-room foyer lined with closets, so that an <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> and an outer door give superb privacy.|$|E

2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the test cock on tube number 5 {{was blocked by}} some enamel paint so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open. Prickers to clear the test cocks had been {{provided}} {{but they were not}} used. This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the [...] "Shut" [...] position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> of the tube being opened. The inrush of water caused the bow of the submarine to sink to the seabed [...] below the surface. How the outer door (bow cap) to Tube 5 became open to the sea is a question that will probably never be answered, Woods maintained that until at least 10 minutes before he opened the tube all the indicators were at [...] "Shut".|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its upper position using a double rack-and-pinion mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another rack-and-pinion. At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal single lock gate) it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release a little water into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 April 1909, Whiting took Porpoise out {{for what}} his crew of six {{thought would be}} a routine run. After Porpoise leveled off in Manila Bay {{at a depth of}} 20 feet (6.1 meters), Whiting {{informed}} his crew that he was convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through a torpedo tube and that he intended to test the idea on himself. He squeezed into Porpoises 18-inch (460-mm) tube and clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door as the crew closed the <b>inner</b> <b>door.</b> When the crew opened the outer door and seawater rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar, which drew his elbows out of the tubes mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms. After 77 seconds, he was free of the submarine and swam to the surface; Porpoise soon surfaced and recovered him. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public [...] in Porpoises log that day, Whiting simply commented, [...] "Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in water in normal condition, as an experiment..." [...] he nevertheless informed his flotilla commander, Lieutenant Guy W. S. Castle, who submitted a report on how the feat had been accomplished.|$|E

2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} the main mast of the USS Maine set upright {{into the center of}} a circular, stylized mausoleum shaped to look like a battleship gun turret. The structure is [...] in diameter and [...] high. The mast pierces the roof the memorial, and is sunk into the floor inside. The mausoleum is constructed of reinforced concrete, sheathed in tan granite on the outside and white marble on the interior. The names and ranks of those who died aboard the Maine are carved into the exterior of the mausoleum, organized into 23 panels. There are eleven slit windows with bronze grills in the structure. [...] The interior roof is a shallow dome, and the interior floor is lined with mosaic tile. The single entry to the mausoleum has two doors. The <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> is made of wood, and half the ship's bell (retrieved from the ocean floor in 1911) is attached to the outer side of this door. The outer door is a bronze gate decorated with metal rope and anchors. Ceremonial stone funeral urns stand {{on either side of the}} entryway. Above the door is carved the following: [...] "Erected in memory of the officers and men who lost their lives in the destruction of the U.S.S. Maine, Habana, Cuba, February 15, 1898".|$|E
