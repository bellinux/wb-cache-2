50|$|Tuning of {{the output}} {{wavelength}} {{is achieved by}} smoothly varying the helical pitch: as the winding changes, so does the length scale of the crystal. This in turn shifts the band edge and changes the optical path length in the lasing cavity. Applying a static electric field perpendicular to the dipole moment of the local nematic phase rotates the rod-like subunits in the hexagonal plane and reorders the chiral phase, winding or unwinding the helical pitch. Similarly, optical tuning of the output wavelength is available using laser light far from the pick-up frequency of the gain medium, with degree of rotation governed by intensity and the angle between the polarization of the incident light and the dipole moment. Reorientation is stable and reversible. The chiral pitch of a cholesteric phase tends to unwind with increasing temperature, with a disorder-order transition to the higher symmetry nematic phase at the high end. By applying a temperature gradient perpendicular to the direction of emission varying the location of stimulation, frequency may be selected across a continuous spectrum. Similarly, a quasi-continuous <b>doping</b> <b>gradient</b> yields multiple laser lines from different locations on the same sample. Spatial tuning may also be accomplished using a wedge cell. The boundary conditions of the narrower cell squeeze the helical pitch by requiring a particular orientation at the edge, with discrete jumps where the outer cells rotate to the next stable orientation; frequency variation between jumps is continuous.|$|E

However, electric fields transverse {{to the surface of}} the CCD -with diverse origins such as <b>doping</b> <b>gradients,</b> guard rings around the imaging area of the sensor, and physical stresses on the silicon lattice- displace this charge, effectively modifying the pixel area and producing noticeable signals in astrometric and photometric measurements. We use data from the science verification period of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to characterize these effects in the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) CCDs. The transverse fields mainly manifest as concentric rings ("tree rings") and bright stripes near the boundaries of the detectors ("edge distortions") with relative amplitudes of about 1 % and 10 % in the flat-field images, respectively. Their nature as pixel size variations is confirmed by comparing their photometric and astrometric signatures. Using flat-field images from DECam, we derive templates in the five DES photometric bands (grizY) for the tree rings and the edge distortions as a function of their position in each DECam detector. These templates can be directly incorporated into the derivation of photometric and astrometric solutions, helping to meet the DES photometric and astrometric requirements.
