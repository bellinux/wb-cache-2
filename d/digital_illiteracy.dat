40|$|This article {{concerns}} the dreams, practices and future for digital media for public history. Has the digital revolution changed the public history discipline? Thanks to {{characteristics such as}} flexibility, interactivity and capacity, digital media offer public historians new ways to present history and interact with the public. Wikipedia and the Children of the Lodz Gettho are two interesting public history cases that experiment with the potential of new media for public history. Looking at history online {{in general and the}} role public historians play there, some problems appear: a lack of historical narratives, a lack of self-criticism and <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> to name three. Based on some online field experience we distill some hands-on lessons concerning narratives, media and the public. Public historians {{have a lot of work}} ahead if they want to understand and use the Internet as a new arena for history...|$|E

Today, when we think of both values it is necessary to look at them under the educational, economical and cultural perspectives because the information process is global and has to do with every country directly or indirectly in a greater or a lesser extent. Therefore, Latin American countries must use infomation transfer in order to solve great problems such as <b>illiteracy,</b> <b>digital</b> exclusion and the lack of a contents industry. The solution to these problems will determine the growth of the scientific production and improve the quality of life of the populations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{findings}} from an ethnographic study of fifteen participant households in North Hobart and Midway Point, Tasmania. Key themes emerging from this research have been gathered and presented here through the metaphor &# 039;digital literacy&# 039;. The {{first half of}} the article is concerned with developing a critical understanding of what is at stake in the notion, or metaphor, of digital literacy. The second half tests these understandings against our research. In our conversations with the people of North Hobart and Midway Point, we found evidence of <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy,</b> and also evidence of the weaknesses of digital literacy as an explanatory trope. We group these findings using three themes: (1) the presence of instrumental literacy; (2) the illegibility of the NBN and its HSB services; and (3) structural conditions limiting the acquisition of the NBN and its HSB services. These three draw upon the digital literacy metaphor, but make its shortcomings clear, and the latter two in particular extend the metaphor from a personal deficit model to one that embraces technologies and social structures...|$|E
40|$|A {{very poor}} {{neighborhood}} in Argentina that has many features of {{lower middle class}} is called “barrio carenciado”. Many heads of the families are unemployed and although children have access to schools it is common {{that they do not}} finish their basic instruction. In many cases NGOs play a fundamental role in changing this reality. In this presentation we detail the implementation of a test bed where 14 families and a school are provided with computers, Internet access and are educated out of <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy.</b> Connectivity is provided by Wireless Mesh Networking (WMN). The research project, is being carried out by a group of researchers from the Universidad de La Plata with different backgrounds in collaboration with the NGO Barrios del Plata (a chapter of Muhammad Yunus´s Grameen Bank). The study monitors the changes in families ’ life (in particularly children education and parents opportunities related to obtaining work). The deployment of WMN in a such a broad area, aims to define the possible lowest cost implementation, and conforms {{an important part of the}} research activities. The project was financed through an award given in a public competition by Microsoft research...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of scholars, political activists, humanitarian workers, and peacebuilding strategists are now advocating ICTs for fostering democratic participation and good governance in Africa. For their part, governments are devising policies geared towards helping citizens controlling their own destiny {{through the use of}} ICTs. They are backed by international development organizations that are implementing numerous programmes and projects centered on the notions of e-government, e-governance, and e-democracy. All those concerned actors and development workers are particularly encouraged by the fact that digital devices are becoming increasingly available for public use on the continent. However, so far, we lack clear evidence that African citizens are actually using, in their everyday lives, digital tools for governance, political participation, and peacebuilding purposes. Based on the case of Niger Republic, this study seeks to contribute to answering this question through semi-structured interviews carried out with Nigerien social media users. It shows that many factors including illiteracy, and particularly <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy,</b> lack of political will, inefficient methods and poor understanding of social media potential contribute to strongly mitigate digital activities when it comes to access, governance, political participation and peacebuilding...|$|E
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> {{is one of}} {{the great}} {{challenges}} of education. In our information society, an adequate level of digital proficiency is an important requirement and teachers’ skills, personality, competence and professional experience are important factors in determining the efficiency of the teaching-learning process. This research has two goals. First, we tried to find out what characteristics a “good” and a “bad” teacher would have based on the trainee teachers’ own experience as secondary school students. We also wanted to know what they think about the social roles of teachers; about the importance of native language in education; what expectations they have regarding the computer skills and competences of secondary school teachers; and what experience they have regarding the use of ICT equipment in the education process. The answers to the open questions about teachers were grouped into four categories: professional expectations, preparedness, teaching skills, personality traits and behaviour. We developed four statistically relevant factors to determine the level of teachers’ computer skills and we used a set of questions containing 10 items to examine the experience of trainee teachers regarding the use of ICT in education. Our study reveals the situation of Hungarian vocational training from Romania, which is a key factor for high-quality teacher training...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} countries like India, the onus of development lies mainly with the government, which faces the predicament of multiple demands and limited resources. This {{leads to a}} situation where even fundamental objectives such as basic literacy for all are not met. On the other hand, there exists a vibrant private sector, which has resources {{and the desire to}} undertake social responsibility. This sector is also coming up with innovative approaches to overcome barriers to education and is targeting the have-nots. This paper discusses results obtained from Madangir (New Delhi), one of the sites where Minimally Invasive Education learning stations were installed. Minimally Invasive Education (MIE) is one such endeavour. It encourages children to learn on their own, with minimal, or no intervention. Children are provided with free access to computers in an open outdoor location. The informal environment enables children to acquire computer literacy, enhance their academic levels and imbibe other life skills. This project is an illustration of a public-private partnership between the Government of NCT of Delhi and NIIT Ltd (India’s leading private sector corporation offering IT education, training and global IT learning solutions) to overcome <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy.</b> Public-private partnership, minimally invasive education, computing skills, social networking, academic achievemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{refugee crisis}} is {{currently}} a major world event. However, not much {{is known about the}} technology adoption and digital skills of those fleeing these conflicts and seeking asylum in foreign countries. To study this, a qualitative study was conducted in Umeå, Sweden. Data was collected through interviews, written responses and observations. The results show that refugees and asylum seekers have positive attitude towards digital technology adoption. However, they perceived digital technology primarily as tools to fulfil their recreational needs. A strategic use of technology for improving productivity was not evident. While formal internet skills were generally common among every user, most interviewees were not able to carry out more complex tasks, such as finding facts online, as they found it particularly challenging to select appropriate search systems and to construct meaningful queries. This research wants to contribute to the literature in IT and social inclusion. The findings reported here suggest that digital divide can be conceptualized as <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> because of lacking awareness over data management and information processing capabilities. Moreover, identifying the digital practices of these minority groups could be extremely meaningful for the digital inclusion strategy efforts of Sweden and for a better design of public services...|$|E
40|$|Based {{upon the}} {{research}} project Access to and Knowledge and Use of the Internet in the University of Antioquia, {{this paper presents}} a model that will enable any university to diagnose and analyze its situation relative to the utilization of the Internet as a support medium for instruction, research, extension and administrative management and, consequently, to determine the possible actions that would be necessary {{in order for the}} Internet to become a "digital opportunity" in every university. This model would also enable each university to address the four great threats or limitations to which universities are often exposed: the digital divide, information and <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy,</b> the poor quality of the digital information that is so often used (information asymmetry), and information overload (infoxication). The methodology utilized in this study included the following steps: creation of a matrix for the information compiled, definition of the macroconcepts-macrovariables of analysis, {{the state of the art}} on the subject, the contextualization of the situation of the university, the selection of the sample group, and, finally, the recommendations to the agencies. As a general conclusion, this study notes the urgent necessity for all of the universities to assume, as one of their principal strategies for action, the incorporation of the TIC and the Internet into their tools and services as well as their mission statements. This incorporation must include the integration of plans, programs, and projects and ongoing evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Social media {{platforms}} {{are being}} considered new podiums for political transformation as political dictatorships supposedly convert to overnight democracies, {{and many more}} people are not only able {{to gain access to}} information, but also gather and disseminate news from their own perspective. When looking at the situation in several sub-Saharan African countries, it becomes clear there are various challenges restricting social media and its palpable yet considerably constrained ability to influence political and social changes. Access to the internet, or lack thereof, is a recognised social stratification causing a “digital divide” thanks to existing inequalities within African and several other societies throughout the world. This article reports on a study that analysed a popular Facebook page in Malawi using a discursive online ethnographic examination of interactions among social media participants seeking to determine the level of activism and democratic participation taking shape on the Malawian digital space. The study also examined potential bottlenecks restraining effective digital participation in Malawi. The article argues that while social media's potential to transform societies is palpable, keeping up with the pace of transformation is no easy task for both digital and non-digital citizens. The study demonstrated social media's potential but also highlighted the problems facing online activists in Malawi, including chief among them <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy.</b> Therefore, the digital sphere is not a political podium for everyone in Malawi as shown by the analysis of digital narratives emerging from the country's online environment, which opens its doors to {{only a tiny fraction of}} the population...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{government}} (e-government) {{has become}} one of the most evolving and important applications of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in recent years. Due to its positive impact on Citizens, government and society alike, most developed and developing countries have attempted to apply e-government projects with mixed success. Many developing countries were facing difficulties in applying successful e-government projects due to different electronic readiness (e-readiness) problems, such as poor ICT infrastructure and a high percentage of <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> among Citizens that have lead to e-government projects abandoned by users. Despite the various efforts by developing countries to overcome these problems, the factors that particularly affect Citizens and their use of e-government have not been adequately identified and tested. This research proposed a model based on e-readiness assessments and relevant literature that investigates the impact of Citizens' readiness for e-government (CREG) on e-government success within developing countries. The C R E G model explores a new vision for e-government success by introducing a combination of e-readiness and trust factors that together directly affect e-government projects in developing countries. The focus of the research is on government to citizen (G 2 C) services. Egypt was selected as an example of a developing country in which to conduct the study and three e-government services were selected for focused investigation. The research confirmed the importance of the CREG model to achieve successful e-government projects in developing countries. The proposed CREG factors including e-readiness, trust and other factors were found to be crucial in Citizens' use or non-use of e-government services. E-readiness factors showed a significant impact on increasing Citizens' usage of e-government services as Citizens who used online e-government services were more e-ready than non-users. The results also highlighted that e-readiness factors need to be combined with trust in both the technology and e-government in order to encourage more Citizens to use e-government services. Adequate security and privacy measures that ensure information protection combined with providing a credible service that satisfies Citizens' needs were shown to be important factors to encourage trust in technology and e-government...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo tem por objetivo descrever e interpretar o fenômeno da prática docente de professores universitários de inglês que se percebem iletrados digitalmente e que ministram aulas para alunos que consideram digitalmente letrados. Trata-se, portanto, de um estudo que visa a refletir sobre a prática pedagógica e sobre questões de letramento digital que emergem quando se torna necessário inserir o computador como mediador em aulas de língua inglesa, ministradas de acordo com a Abordagem Instrumental. Esta pesquisa se fundamenta nos conceitos de reflexão (Dewey, 1933, 1938, 1967; Perrenoud, 2002; Schön, 1983, 1987, 1992, 2000), de letramento digital (Buzato, 2001; Soares, 2002), e nos pressupostos da Abordagem Instrumental ao ensino-aprendizagem da língua inglesa (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Strevens, 1988; Robinson, 1991; Dudley Evans & St. John, 2000; Ramos, 2005; Celani, 2005). A abordagem metodológica utilizada é a hermenêutico-fenomenológica (van Manen, 1990; Ricouer, 1986 / 2002; Freire, 2006, 2007). A descrição e a interpretação do fenômeno em foco partem de registros textuais (narrativa e entrevista) de duas professoras sobre as experiências que viveram no Ensino Superior e sobre como buscam lidar com sua falta de letramento digital para atender as demandas da tecnologia, da instituição e de seus alunos. 	Os resultados da pesquisa indicam que busca e reflexão são os temas que constituem a manifestação do fenômeno investigado, revelando sua natureza, sua identidade. Tais resultados podem contribuir para que docentes de inglês reflitam sobre questões de letramento digital e sobre a Abordagem Instrumental aplicada a contextos universitários em que professores e alunos têm conhecimento e domínio diferenciado do uso de recursos tecnológicosThis study aims at {{describing}} {{and interpreting}} the classroom practice of English teachers who {{perceive themselves as}} digitally illiterate while evaluating their university Technology students as digitally literate. By addressing such a phenomenon of lived experience, this investigation therefore aims at reflecting upon teaching practice and digital literacy issues that emerge from instructional contexts in which computers must be used as mediators in ESP classes. To achieve its purpose, this study is founded on the concepts of reflection (Dewey, 1933, 1938, 1967; Perrenoud, 2002; Schön, 1983, 1987, 1992, 2000), digital literacy (Buzato, 2001; Soares, 2002) and English for Specific Purposes (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Strevens, 1988; Robinson, 1991; Dudley Evans & St. John, 2000; Ramos, 2005;Celani, 2005). The methodological approach adopted is the hermeneutic-phenomenological one (van Manen, 1990; Ricouer, 1986 / 2002; Freire, 2006, 2007). The phenomenon description and interpretation emerged from two teachers textual registers (narrative and interview) on their university teaching experiences in Technology courses {{and on the way}} they deal with their perceived <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> in order to fulfill the institutions and learners demands. This research results indicate that searching and reflection are the themes that constitute the phenomenon on focus, thus revealing its nature, its identity. Such outcomes may provide teachers of English with input to reflect upon digital literacy and upon the ESP approach applied to university contexts in which teachers and students have a different level of knowledge and expertise in managing technological resource...|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become an}} indispensable part of daily life, and businesses realize that the internet can be another channel for e-commerce that reaches local and global consumers. This research is an examination of three hypotheses that demonstrate {{the significance of the}} user-interface, the online payment system and consumers relationships within their social environments as elements that may impact on an individuals’ decision to buy online. H 1. There is a positive relationship between the quality ofonline shopping websites and customers’ decision to purchase online in Saudi Arabia and New Zealand. H 2. Relationships and the experience of others is an important factor that has an impact on the customer behavior and decision making to buy online. H 3. There is a positive relationship between the existence of good online payment systems and the tendency of the consumers to shop online. This study is an exploration of the factors that influence e-shoppers’ purchases using a comparative case study with interviews that explore the post-experience perceptions of a sample set of online shoppers. The researcher takes the view that consumers from different cultures recognize different factors affecting their consumer attitudes. This research is a comparison of online buying behavior in Saudi Arabia and New Zealand. Due to the underdeveloped state of online shopping in Saudi Arabia despite it being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the research was motivated by a desire to identify the factors that may give rise to this situation. It was deemed impractical to study all factors, so the researcher focused on factors that affect consumers’attitudes. The selection process was {{based on the belief that}} consumers are the most important agents in the e-commerce process. An exploratory, qualitative research method is adopted to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors that affect consumers’ behavior in purchasing online. A semi-structured interview was designed and 12 participants were interviewed (four participant from New Zealand, four participants from Saudi Arabia and the last four are from Saudis living in New Zealand). A content analysis was undertaken with the assistance of the qualitative software NVIVO 9. 2 to answer the questions designed for this thesis project. The key findings of this research are thatthe elements tested in the hypotheses were not as important to the selected participants (sample selected for the study). The evidence showed that privacy and security issues, late delivery service and credit cards fees were the most important factors for the New Zealand case study, whereas the key factors in the Saudi case study were the failure of the postal system, <b>digital</b> <b>illiteracy</b> (ignorance of this service) and a lack of motivation to purchase online. Future studies using a large quantitative sample are recommended to build on these exploratory findings. It is hoped that this research will provide a guideline to improve the state of online shopping in Saudi Arabia by taking advantage of the information provided by this research...|$|E
