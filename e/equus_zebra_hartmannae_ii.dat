50|$|The Hartmann's {{mountain}} <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>hartmannae)</b> is a subspecies of {{the mountain}} zebra found in far south-western Angola and western Namibia.Hartmann's mountain zebras prefer to live in small groups of 7-12 individuals.

50|$|The {{mountain}} zebra has a dewlap, {{which is more}} conspicuous in <b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra</b> than in <b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>hartmannae.</b> Like all extant zebras, {{mountain zebra}}s are boldly striped in black or dark brown and no two individuals look exactly alike. The whole body is striped except for the belly. In the Cape mountain zebra, the ground colour is effectively white, but the ground colour in Hartmann's zebra is slightly buff.|$|R

50|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30-50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and {{there is no evidence that}} they interbred.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 African horse {{sickness}} (AHS) {{was reported}} in the south-western Khomas Region, central Namibia (22 ° 24. 063 ´ S, 17 ° 01. 791 ´ E; 23 ° 32. 617 ´ S, 15 ° 53. 870 ´ E), contrary to expectations that the arid conditions in the area would limit its occurrence. This prompted investigation into the occurrence of AHS in horses, a possible reservoir animal, the Hartmann’s mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra.</b> <b>hartmannae)</b> and the occurrence of the Culicoides midge vector (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) of the disease in the area. Questionnaires were used to explore the geographic characteristics of the study area, the occurrence of an expected AHS virus reservoir animal, E. z. hartmannae and AHS in horses in the study area. According to the questionnaire, rainfall patterns seem to follow topography of the area, where the north-east formed the higher rainfall (420 mm/a) high-ground and the south-western formed the lower rainfall (120 mm/a) pediment zone in the south-west. Cases of AHS occurred mostly in mid-rainfall zones. E. z. hartmannae were present throughout the area. They migrated from the southwest towards the north-eastern high-grounds during droughts, presumably along ephemeral river beds. E. z. hartmannae were sampled for blood and tissues and analysed for evidence of African Horse Sickness Virus (AHSV) infection by indirect ELISA, RT-PCR and virus isolation techniques. All useable samples tested positive for anti-AHSV antibodies. Viral RNA was demonstrated in 26 % of all the zebra sampled. No viable viruses were isolated from these samples, however further research is required, as difficult sampling conditions may have yielded false-negatives. From 6 July to 21 September 2009, Culicoides midges were collected during the dry winter season in suction UV-light traps installed at five selected sites along a rainfall gradient. In 38 collections, a total of 9091 Culicoides individuals, representing 25 species were collected. The dominance of the proven vector of AHSV, Culicoides imicola Kieffer, varied in dominance from 94 % near Windhoek with high altitude and relatively higher annual rainfall, to 12 % at the site situated farthest southwest, with the lowest altitude and annual rainfall. From what was observed of the occurrence of AHS in horses, E. z. hartmannae and the distribution and abundance of the AHSV vector (Culicoides spp.), it was concluded that AHS can be maintained in the south-western Khomas Region even in the lowest mean annual rainfall zones.
