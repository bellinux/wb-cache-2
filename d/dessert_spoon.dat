25|$|A {{number of}} world records in egg-and-spoon racing are held by New-Yorker and serial record-holder Ashrita Furman; these include, as {{published}} by Guinness World Records, fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race (19.39 seconds); fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race while holding the spoon in the mouth (25.13 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race (7 minutes, 8 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon with both hands (8 minutes, 5 seconds); and fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon in the mouth (9 minutes, 29 seconds). In 1990 a runner completed the London Marathon in three hours forty-seven minutes while carrying a <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon</b> with an uncooked egg balanced upon it.|$|E
2500|$|The silver {{tableware}} in the hoard comprises three strainers and 33 spoons, of two types. [...] Seventeen of the spoons are cochlearia, {{with long}} tapered handles, {{and the other}} sixteen are the larger ligulae or cigni, with bowls {{about the size of}} a modern <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon</b> and short, coiled handles ending in birds' heads. [...] Many of the spoons bear pagan inscriptions to Faunus, a minor Roman god who had many characteristics in common with the Greek Pan. [...] There is no overtly Christian symbolism in the hoard, though one spoon is decorated with the figure of a fish, which can often be an oblique reference to Christianity. [...] Bacchic iconography is obvious in the group, and was traditional in Roman culture, but in the late Roman period, many Bacchic motifs were adopted and given new interpretations by Christians. Nevertheless, at this date, the end of the 4th century AD, there was no obstacle to placing unequivocally Christian symbols and inscriptions on personal possessions, so that their absence here is noteworthy. The openly, and probably exclusively, pagan iconography remains one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the assemblage.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{known as}} a parfait spoon, it is also {{commonly}} used for eating ice cream, especially floats and sundaes. As these desserts are usually served in tall glasses, regular teaspoons or <b>dessert</b> <b>spoons</b> become inconvenient choices due to their limited reach.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain was}} helped to pudding in a soup plate, that being {{relatively}} a rather small dessert plate for him.

6000|$|But, in the meanwhile, {{there are}} animals in which results so strange, fantastic, even {{seemingly}} horrible, are produced, that fallen man may be pardoned, if he shrinks {{from them in}} disgust. [...] That, at least, must be a consequence of our own wrong state; for everything is beautiful and perfect in its place. It may be answered, [...] "Yes, in its place; but its place is not yours. You had no business to look at it, and must pay the penalty for intermeddling." [...] I doubt that answer; for surely, if man have liberty to do anything, he has liberty to search out freely his heavenly Father's works; and yet every one seems to have his antipathic animal; and I know one bred from his childhood to zoology by land and sea, and bold in asserting, and honest in feeling, that all without exception is beautiful, who yet cannot, after handling and petting and admiring all day long every uncouth and venomous beast, avoid a paroxysm of horror {{at the sight of}} the common house-spider. At all events, whether we were intruding or not, in turning this stone, we must pay a fine for having done so; for there lies an animal as foul and monstrous to the eye as [...] "hydra, gorgon, or chimaera dire," [...] and yet so wondrously fitted to its work, that we must needs endure for our own instruction to handle and to look at it. Its name, if you wish for it, is Nemertes; probably N. Borlasii; (18) a worm of very [...] "low" [...] organization, though well fitted enough for its own work. You see it? That black, shiny, knotted lump among the gravel, small enough to be taken up in a <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon.</b> Look now, as it is raised and its coils drawn out. Three feet - six - nine, at least: with a capability of seemingly endless expansion; a slimy tape of living caoutchouc, some eighth of an inch in diameter, a dark chocolate- black, with paler longitudinal lines. Is it alive? It hangs, helpless and motionless, a mere velvet string across the hand. Ask the neighbouring Annelids and the fry of the rock fishes, or put it into a vase at home, and see. It lies motionless, trailing itself among the gravel; you cannot tell where it begins or ends; it may be a dead strip of sea-weed, Himanthalia lorea, perhaps, or Chorda filum; or even a tarred string. So thinks the little fish who plays over and over it, till he touches at last what is too surely a head. In an instant a bell-shaped sucker mouth has fastened to his side. In another instant, from one lip, a concave double proboscis, just like a tapir's (another instance of the repetition of forms), has clasped him like a finger; and now begins the struggle: but in vain. He is being [...] "played" [...] with such a fishing- line as the skill of a Wilson or a Stoddart never could invent; a living line, with elasticity beyond that of the most delicate fly- rod, which follows every lunge, shortening and lengthening, slipping and twining round every piece of gravel and stem of sea- weed, with a tiring drag such as no Highland wrist or step could ever bring to bear on salmon or on trout. The victim is tired now; and slowly, and yet dexterously, his blind assailant is feeling and shifting along his side, till he reaches one end of him; and then the black lips expand, and slowly and surely the curved finger begins packing him end-foremost down into the gullet, where he sinks, inch by inch, till the swelling which marks his place is lost among the coils, and he is probably macerated to a pulp long before he has reached the opposite extremity of his cave of doom. [...] Once safe down, the black murderer slowly contracts again into a knotted heap, and lies, like a boa with a stag inside him, motionless and blest. (19) ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{finger bowl}} is {{a bowl of}} water used for rinsing one's fingers after the last course of a formal meal served à la russe.

If a separate fruit course is to follow dessert, the finger bowl should be brought in at that time, with the fruit fork and knife. Alternatively, a full array of dishes can be brought out at once, with the finger bowl atop the dessert plate with its fork and <b>spoon,</b> and the <b>dessert</b> plate atop the fruit plate, with doilies between each dish; in this type of service, the fruit fork and knife are brought out after the dessert plates and silver are cleared. [...] "Where there are plenty of servants, the finger bowl may not come in on the fruit plate but may be brought on its own serving plate, replacing the used fruit plate before the guests leave the table for coffee." [...] A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon</b> is a spoon {{designed}} specifically for eating dessert and sometimes used for soup or cereals.

50|$|A French sauce spoon or saucier spoon is a spoon that is {{typically}} {{the size and}} shape of a <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon,</b> but with a flattened bowl that has a thinner edge and a small notch on one side.

Modern soup spoons are usually stainless steel or silver-plated, but in the past wooden and horn spoons were more common. The idea of including a separate soup spoon in a table setting originated in the eighteenth century, when the bowl shapes varied widely, deep or shallow, oval, pointed, egg-shaped or circular. Spoon shapes became more standardized in nineteenth-century silverware.|$|E

Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon,</b> the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for used with the small type of coffee cup. Another teaspoon, called an orange spoon (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.|$|E
50|$|The huesillos, {{or dried}} peaches, are washed and soaked the night prior to {{preparation}} {{in order to}} rehydrate them. Once hydrated, they are cooked for thirty minutes or more in a sugar and water mixture, optionally with some natural cinnamon sticks. To give the drink its honey hue, sugar is heated in a sauce pan in order to caramelize it {{and bring it to}} a rich orange ruby color, which is added to the syrup mixture although this method is not always used. While the huesillos are cooking, the mote, or husked wheat, is cooked in water until tender. Once the mote are cooked, they are drained and added to the sweet huesillos drink, and left to cool. This combination is served chilled, in a tall glass with a tall <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon</b> for easy serving.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{phytotherapy}} {{is increasingly}} being implemented into medical practice, {{especially for the}} prevention and treatment of many diseases. Acute respiratory viral infections are most common in childhood and in adults. Acute rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngitis and acute laryngitis refer to diseases of the upper respiratory tract. The main reason for respiratory diseases in recurrent respiratory infection child is disorders of mucociliary and immune protection. The therapeutic value of medicinal plants is determined by their biologically active substances. The method of application of phytotherpy {{is an integral part}} of traditional medicine. Herbal medicine can be used at home and does not require special equipment. The main indications for the herbal medicine use in pediatrics are the initial stage of the disease as a primary method of treatment due to mild and low toxicity; as a supporting treatment for enhancing the protective forces of the child’s body during the disease deterioration. During the recovery period herbal medicine again occupies a leading position, especially in case of chronic diseases because it can be used for a long time and is well combined with synthetic drugs. The terms of appointment of herbs for children: prescription of medicinal plants for children must be individual according to indications, taking into account the child’s age; it is recommended to take into account the form and nature of the course of the main disease and comorbidities as well; at the initial stage of the treatment it is better to use some medicinal plants or species consisting of 2 – 3 plants and in the future a more complex composition; therapy with medicinal plants requires a long period to be used use, especially in chronic diseases; in the treatment of chronic diseases a good effect preventive courses of herbal medicine was revealed, which are appointed during seasonal exacerbations; in case of intolerance symptoms (nausea, vomiting, itching, altered defecation) after receiving medicinal plant its use should be discontinued; pediatricians should not recommend using herbs with potential toxic effects (for example, high concentrations or prolonged use of shoots of wild rosemary, tansy and other). The dosage is a very important question, which depends on the age of a child. The scheme proposed by N. P. Menshikova et al. is convenient for practice. The daily dose in terms of dry plant material is: for сhildren under 1 year old — 1 / 2 teaspoon, from 1 to 3 years — 1 teaspoon, 3  to 6 years — 1 <b>dessert</b> <b>spoon,</b> 6 to 10 years — 1 tablespoon, 10 and older — 1 – 2 tablespoons. In case of the appointment of herbal me­dicine pediatrician should take into account the characteristics of the therapeutic effects of medicinal plants, their dosing and possible side effects; it is necessary to monitor treatment to assess its efficacy and safety. In the treatment of respiratory diseases inhalation is effective, using inhalation devices. Aerosol inhalation for treatment of respiratory disease may have different effects: antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, a bronchodilator, and may promote the liquefaction of sputum evacuation, improve the function of the ciliated epithelium. For the purpose of inhalations medicinal plants containing essential oils are used: Calendula, Peppermint, Chamomile, Salvia, Eucalyptus, Thyme, birch, Plantain. The first inhalation lasts for 1 – 2 minu­tes and later 5 – 10 minutes. Also ready officinal herbal drugs can be used in pediatric practice: essential oils, teas, juices. A good effect of essential oil of Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Salvia and others, tincture of Calendula, Eucalyptus, Salvia, Peppermint. Relative contraindications are considered: a) allergic conditions in children, b)  acute, life-threatening conditions and diseases, c) pregnancy — for medicinal plants causing changes in hormonal balance. In pediatric practice, taking into account the characteristics of acute respiratory viral infections the medicinal plants of several pharmacological groups mainly used are: plants with a tonic effect (plants containing vitamins and minerals — rose hips, black currant, sea buckthorn, citrus fruits), adaptogens and immune modulators should be used in pediatric practice with caution (Ginseng, Rhodiola Rosea, Aralia Manchurian), plants containing biogenic stimulators — the aloe latex, kalanchoe, plant with bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect (sage leaves drug, eucalyptus switchgrass), plants with anti-inflammatory effect, containing tannins — oak bark, Potentilla rhizome, rhizome of Polygonum snake, burnet, alder cones, etc; plants containing essential oils, azulene derivatives — Chamomile flowers; plants containing mucus — Farfara leaves, Plantain; Linden flowers; plants with antipyretic and diaphoretic action — plants containing vitamins (fruits of raspberry, black currant fruit, cranberry); plants containing salicylic acid derivatives — Viola tricolor, raspberry fruit; plants with protective, emollient, expectorant action containing mucus — Farfara leaves; Linden flowers, plantain leaves are large; containing alkaloids, with antitussive effect —codeine phosphate; glaucine hydrochloride grass of Thermopsis lancet; bronchodilators plants; plants with anti-allergic effect, containing flavonoids — herb of Viola tricolor, the roots of Licorice. The article presents the re­commendation of professor O. D. Barnaulov, a pediatric phytotherapist O. A. Daniluk on herbal medicine using in children, the rules of the certain medicinal plants use by Y. I. Korshikova, dosage regimen for herbal remedies for children, proposed by N. P.
