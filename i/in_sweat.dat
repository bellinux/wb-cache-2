25|$|Potassium is {{eliminated}} from the body through the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands. In the kidneys, elimination of potassium is passive (through the glomeruli), and reabsorption is active in the proximal tubule and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is active excretion of potassium in the distal tubule and the collecting duct; both are controlled by aldosterone. <b>In</b> <b>sweat</b> glands potassium elimination is quite similar to the kidney, its excretion is also controlled by aldosterone.|$|E

25|$|The protein spans this {{membrane}} {{and acts}} as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell (cytoplasm) to the surrounding fluid. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell; however, in the sweat ducts, it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat duct into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not resorb ions <b>in</b> <b>sweat</b> ducts, chloride and thiocyanate released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin. Additionally hypothiocyanite, OSCN, cannot be produced by the immune defense system. Because chloride is negatively charged, this modifies the electrical potential {{inside and outside the}} cell that normally causes cations to cross into the cell. Sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space. The excess chloride within sweat ducts prevents sodium resorption by epithelial sodium channels and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt, which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.|$|E

25|$|I-131 will be {{eliminated}} from the body {{over the next several}} weeks after it is given. The majority of I-131 will {{be eliminated}} from the human body in 3–5 days, through natural decay, and through excretion <b>in</b> <b>sweat</b> and urine. Smaller amounts will continue to be released over the next several weeks, as the body processes thyroid hormones created with the I-131. For this reason, it is advised to regularly clean toilets, sinks, bed sheets and clothing used by the person who received the treatment. Patients may also be advised to wear slippers or socks at all times, and avoid prolonged close contact with others. This minimizes accidental exposure by family members, especially children. Use of a decontaminant specially made for radioactive iodine removal may be advised. The use of chlorine bleach solutions, or cleaners that contain chlorine bleach for cleanup, are not advised, since radioactive elemental iodine gas may be released. Airborne I-131 may cause a greater risk of second-hand exposure, spreading contamination over a wide area. Patient is advised if possible to stay in a room with a bathroom connected to it to limit unintended exposure to family members.|$|E

Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that an undercut, overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible {{had it not been for}} the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it was a good one at least.

40|$|Isometric {{handgrip}} exercise (IHG) increases sweating rate {{without changing}} core or skin temperatures. The contribution of central command resulting <b>in</b> increases <b>in</b> <b>sweating</b> rate during IHG is unknown. To investigate this question, seven subjects performed IHG (35 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min) followed by 2 -min of post-exercise ischaemia (PEI), {{with and without}} partial neuromuscular blockade (PNB). PNB was performed to augment central command during the IHG bout. These trials were conducted while the subject was normothermic, mildly heated, and moderately heated. On the non-exercising arm, forearm sweating rate was monitored over a microdialysis membrane perfused with neostigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), and at an adjacent untreated site. In normothermia with PNB, despite reduced force production during IHG (17 ± 9 versus 157 ± 13 N; P < 0. 001), the elevation <b>in</b> <b>sweating</b> rate at the neostigmine-treated site was greater relative to the control IHG bout (P < 0. 05). During subsequent PEI, for the PNB trial mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and sweating rate returned towards pre-IHG levels, while during the control trial these variables remained elevated. During IHG while mildly heated, the elevation <b>in</b> <b>sweating</b> rate was greater during the PNB trial relative to the control trial. In contrast, during moderate heating sweating increased during IHG for both trials, however the elevation <b>in</b> <b>sweating</b> rate during the PNB trial was not greater than during the control trial. These results suggest that central command is capable of modulating <b>sweating</b> rate <b>in</b> all thermal conditions, however its effect is reduced when body temperatures and/or sweating rate are substantially elevated...|$|R

500|$|The third {{attempt to}} poison Litvinenko {{took place at}} around 5pm of 1 November in the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square. The bus he {{travelled}} in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity – but large amounts had been detected at the hotel. Polonium was subsequently found in a fourth-floor room and in a cup in the Pine Bar at the hotel. After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped {{at the office of}} Boris Berezovsky. He used a fax machine, where radioactive contamination was found later. At 6pm, Akhmed Zakayev picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so significant that the car was rendered unusable. Everything that he touched at home during the next three days [...] was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later. His wife tested positive for ingesting polonium, but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun). The patterns and levels of radioactivity the assassins left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Lugovoy and Kovtun handled it directly. The human body dilutes polonium before excreting it <b>in</b> <b>sweat,</b> which results in a reduced radioactivity level. There were also traces of Po-210 found at the Hey Jo/Abracadabra bar, Dar Marrakesh restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxis.|$|E
