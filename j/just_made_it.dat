5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it,</b> for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E

In {{the first game of}} the season, he gave up seven runs on 11 hits and <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into the fifth inning before being {{replaced}} in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He recovered from the loss by pitching a complete game two-hit shutout in his next outing against the Dodgers. In an eight-start period from April 26 to June 4, Richard threw six complete games, including two back-to-back shutouts, and lowered his ERA from 4.15 to 3.05. He struck out 67 and gave up only 39hits in the 63total innings he pitched. On a June 9 start against the Cardinals, Richard struck out 12batters but also walked six and gave up five earned runs. By the end of the first half of the season Richard had pitched back-to-back games with nine and 12 strikeout performances, against the Reds and Dodgers, respectively. At the All-Star break, he had an 8–9 record with a 3.49ERA but also had 157strikeouts in 139innings of work.|$|E

At the next race at Texas Motor Speedway, he qualified 4th, and ran in the top-15 all day, coming home with an eleventh-place finish. Hines ran his last two races that season at Martinsville Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway. At both races, Hines qualified the No. 7 in 22nd place, and finished 13th.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} the irony of Manilius's {{relative}} obscurity, because he wrote the Astronomica {{in the hope of}} attaining literary immortality. Housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory Latin poem written for his edition, contrasting the movement of celestial objects with mortality, and with the fate of Manilius and his work. He compared the Astronomica to a shipwreck (carmina ... naufraga), seeing that it had only <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the present day in an incomplete and imperfect state, and mused that because Manilius's ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed, his work should serve as an example of why [...] "no human being should ever wish to trust the gods" [...] (ne quis forte deis fidere vellet homo).|$|E

[...] However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it [...] "the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode {{is an example of the}} [...] "danger of needlessly dragging things out, as we have seen the waste of ending things before they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past."

500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day.

He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood how he did it. I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life".

During his time at Leeds University he lived with Maya Lahan (Laila Rouass). While enrolled at Leeds he visited Dakar, Senegal, where he engaged in shipping cannabis to Hamburg in exchange for money. When he was caught the authorities took the shipment and his money, stranding him in Dakar. To gain enough money {{to get back to the}} UK, he worked in a casino. [...] While working there John Bateman was approached by Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen), who persuaded him to deliver packages for him. One of the packages delivered by Bateman was a bomb that exploded at a British Embassy, killing 17 people. To escape the country Bateman killed a friend of his named Lucas North. [...] North had <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> past the first battery of tests for admission to MI5. Bateman assumed North's identity and left Maya behind. Bateman/North would later suppress these memories, believing that Vaughn was solely responsible for the bombing and for his friend's death. He would later join MI5 in place of the real Lucas North and become head of Section D. He was also once married to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza). During an operation in Russia, Lucas North was captured and imprisoned for eight years, during which time he was often subjected to torture.|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business.

When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.
