60|$|I was {{a little}} child (was born in 1819,) but tramp'd freely about the {{neighborhood}} and town, even then; was often on the aforesaid New Ferry; remember how I was petted and <b>deadheaded</b> by the gatekeepers and deckhands (all such fellows are kind to little children,) and remember the horses that seem'd to me so queer as they trudg'd around in the central houses of the boats, making the water-power. (For it was just {{on the eve of}} the steam-engine, which was soon after introduced on the ferries.) Edward Copeland (afterward Mayor) had a grocery store then at the corner of Front and Catharine streets.|$|E
60|$|I think I {{could go}} near to {{be a perfect}} Christian if I were always a visitor, as I have {{sometimes}} been, {{at the house of}} some hospitable friend. I can show a great deal of self-denial where the best of everything is urged upon me with kindly importunity. It is not so very hard to turn the other cheek for a kiss. And when I meditate upon the pains taken for our entertainment in this life, on the endless variety of seasons, of human character and fortune, on the costliness of the hangings and furniture of our dwelling here, I sometimes feel a singular joy in looking upon myself as God's guest, and cannot but believe that we should all be wiser and happier, because more grateful, if we were always mindful of our privilege in this regard. And should we not rate more cheaply any honor that men could pay us, if we remembered that every day we sat at the table of the Great King? Yet must we not forget that we are in strictest bonds His servants also; for there is no impiety so abject as that which expects to be <b>deadheaded</b> (ut ita dicam) through life, and which, calling itself trust in Providence, is in reality asking Providence to trust us and taking up all our goods on false pretences. It is a wise rule to take the world as we find it, not always to leave it so.|$|E

50|$|Monardella odoratissima {{will grow}} {{in full sun}} to medium shade. It can be pruned lightly in the late fall or early winter to create a bushier plant, as they can {{otherwise}} be sprawling. They bloom profusely anytime from April through August. Because they are floriferous, they look best when spent blooms are <b>deadheaded.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is the {{practice}} of removing any spent, faded, withered, or discoloured flowers. The purpose is to encourage the plant to focus its energy and resources on forming new shoots and blooms, rather than fruit production. Deadheading may also be performed for aesthetic purposes, if spent flowers are unsightly. Any roses such as Rosa glauca or Rosa moyesii that are grown for their decorative hips should not be <b>deadheaded.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oakville Transit also {{originally}} {{stored and}} maintained the buses at their garage. Buses were later stored and serviced at the Mississauga Truck and Bus Collision (MTB) facility, located in Milton. This eliminated unnecessary travel to/from Oakville as the buses previously had been <b>deadheaded</b> {{to and from}} Oakville each day. Prior to the agreement with MTB, Milton's buses were stored at GO Transit's Milton garage. The Town of Milton extended the contract for conventional transit services with Oakville Transit for a further three years, effective March 1, 2008.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, on April 4, 1993, {{the entire}} New Orleans - Jacksonville route {{reestablished}} passenger train service with {{the extension of}} the Sunset Limited to Miami, using the route of Amtraks Silver Meteor south of Jacksonville. It was serviced at Amtraks Hialeah yards for the return trip but schedule unreliability caused the Sunset Limiteds eastern endpoint to be shortened to Sanford on November 10, 1996. Service was re-extended to Orlando, Florida on October 26, 1997, with the train <b>deadheaded</b> (operated empty) between Orlando and Sanford for servicing. Sanford was, and still is, the servicing point for Amtraks Auto Train.|$|E
50|$|North Star Rail and the National Railroad Museum {{came to an}} {{agreement}} in November 1991 for a ten-year lease (which was later renewed ten years later). 261 was moved from Green Bay to Minneapolis to the GE shops at Humboldt Yard in September 1992. There, a full-time staff rebuilt the engine. Work progressed quickly, allowing for a hydrostatic test in June 1993, a test fireup in July, and the eventual restoration completion in September. After passing the FRA inspection on September 14, the engine <b>deadheaded</b> over Wisconsin Central in time for its first public excursions on September 18-19, 1993. The engine later returned to its new home at the leased Burlington Northern Minneapolis Junction.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{participated in}} the Steamtown National Historic Site's grand opening in July 1995. Over five days, 261 <b>deadheaded</b> from Minneapolis to Scranton, Pennsylvania. The {{locomotive}} stayed in Scranton {{for the next year}} pulling numerous excursions, including rare mileage trips, a rare snow plow run, and the engine's first steam doubleheader with Susquehanna 142. A Hancock 3 chime whistle was temporarily added to the locomotive and then replaced with an AT&SF 6 chime whistle, which it remains with today, but still also keeping its original non-Hancock 3 chime whistle and airhorn. 261 returned to the Midwest after almost a year at Steamtown. On its way home, the engine made its first runs over the newly formed Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. It pulled a few sets of excursions in 1997 and 1998 over BNSF and TC&W trackage.|$|E
50|$|Sweet peas {{have been}} {{cultivated}} since the 17th {{century and a}} vast number of cultivars are commercially available. They are grown for their flower colour (usually in pastel shades of blue, pink, purple and white, including bi-colours), and for their intense unique fragrance. They are grown by gardeners for private enjoyment or for exhibition, and in the floristry trade. The large, pea-shaped seeds are sown in cold frames in Spring or Autumn. The seeds benefit from pre-soaking or chipping with a sharp blade. The plants are also available later in the season, as young plants or plugs. They are grown up canes, with the new shoots being regularly pinched out to promote a bushy habit and higher flower yields. Plants typically reach heights of 1-2m, with the flowers appearing in midsummer and continuing for many weeks if regularly <b>deadheaded.</b>|$|E
50|$|Conrail {{agreed to}} {{maintain}} the commuter line, but after six month test run by Conrail, the agency officially ended service from Cleveland Union Terminal to Youngstown, due to loss of money. On a snow-covered January 14, 1977, numerous passengers, including railfans, historians and people interested in seeing or riding the train. People crammed themselves into the three cars attached with Engine 4014, playing games, talking and having refreshments as Train 28 left the Union Terminal at 5:24. The train made stops along the line to Youngstown including East 55th Street, Lee Road, North Randall, Solon, Mantua, Aurora, Geauga Lake, Garrettsville - Hiram, Warren, Niles and into Youngstown. At {{the end of the}} ride in Youngstown, the train stayed for twenty minutes while the train got photographed by the railfans of the Railroad Enthusiasts. After that, the train <b>deadheaded</b> into Brier Hill Yard for the passenger cars to be detached, while the locomotive, 4014, was converted for use to freight service.|$|E
40|$|In high {{frequency}} transit operations, randomness and incidents often result in highly irregular headways which can significantly decrease service quality. Deadheading is one commonly used real-time operations control strategy that can improve service quality in such situations. When a vehicle is <b>deadheaded,</b> it runs empty from a terminal skipping {{a number of}} stations, typically {{in order to reduce}} expected large headways at later stations. The real-time deadheading problem is to determine at dispatching time which vehicles to deadhead and how many stations to skip in order to minimize the total passenger cost in the system. This paper formulates this problem, optimally solves a simplified version of the general formulation, and demonstrates that the solutions of the simpler problem are good approximations to the solutions of the more general problem. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} found in the International Journal of Management Sciences Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 1 - 20 which was {{published}} in 2014. It focuses on Train Schedule Optimization with a case of National Railways of Zimbabwe. The locomotive assignment problem involves assigning a set of locomotives to each train in a pre-planned train schedule so as to provide sufficient power to pull them from their origins to their destinations. An integrated model that determines the set of active and <b>deadheaded</b> locomotives for each train, light travelling locomotives and train-to-train connections is presented. The model explicitly considers consist-busting and consistency. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the problem that contains about 92 integer variables and 56 constraints is presented in the study. Three models are discussed for assigning locomotives to wagons and coaches and the results are compared amongst the models themselves and compared to the existing scenario at National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). The models generally improve the number of saved locomotives and number of used locomotives. The Locomotive Assignment Model(LAM) solution obtained showed savings of over 70 locomotives, which translates into savings of over one-hundred thousand dollars weekly...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 115 Magnetic {{drive and}} canned motor pumps have many common {{features}} including bearing and rotor designs, internal cooling, and lubrication. The primary differences {{center on the}} manner in which the rotating magnetic field is created and the makeup of the stationary isolation device. Proper bearing lubrication is essential to long, reliable operation. Fluid film journal bearings are used to support the rotor and flatfaced thrust bearings to limit its axial travel. Hydraulic balance can be used to limit the loads transmitted to the thrust bearings. This can accomplished by either balance holes and set clearance throttling devices or pumping vanes, as in standard pumps or by variable clearance throttles that automatically adjust to maintain axial balance. A rotating magnetic field is generated by either an electrical stator coil or a rotating permanent magnet assembly. This drives an inner rotor consisting of induction motor laminations or permanent magnets. The barrier between the inner rotor and the atmosphere contains the process, but has nonmagnetic properties to allow the passage of the field undisturbed. Eddy currents are set up in the barrier and generate heat that must be removed. A clean cooling stream with sufficient margin from vaporization is required to carry of the heat generated by magnetic hysteresis and bearing friction loses. The pressure/temperature characteristics of the process dictate the type of circulation needed to maintain a liquid state. Instrumentation is offered to help monitor the condition of the cooling stream and avoid <b>deadheaded</b> and dry-running operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{locomotive}} {{scheduling problem}} (or the locomotive assignment problem) is to assign a consist (a set of locomotives) to each train in a pre-planned train schedule {{so as to}} provide them sufficient power to pull them from their origins to their destinations. Locomotive scheduling problems {{are among the most}} important problems in railroad scheduling. In this paper, we report the results of a study of the locomotive scheduling problem faced by CSX Transportation, a major US railroad company. We consider the planning version of the locomotive scheduling model (LSM), where there are multiple types of locomotives and we need to decide the set of locomotives to be assigned to each train. We present an integrated model that determines the set of active and <b>deadheaded</b> locomotives for each train, light traveling locomotives from power sources to power sinks, and train-to-train connections (specifying which inbound train and outbound trains can directly connect). An important feature of our model is that we explicitly consider consist-bustings and consistency. A consist is said to be busted when the set of locomotives coming on an inbound train is broken into subsets to be reassigned to two or more outbound trains. A solution is said to be consistent over a week with respect to a train, if the train gets the same locomotive assignment each day it runs. We give a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of the problem that contains about 197 thousand integer variables and 67 thousand constraints. An MIP of this size cannot be solved to optimality or near-optimality in acceptable running times using commercially available software. Using problem decomposition, integer programming, and very large-scale neighborhood search, we developed a solution technique to solve this problem within 30 minutes of computation time on a Pentium III computer. When we compared our solution with the solution obtained by the software in-house developed by CSX, we obtained a savings of over 400 locomotives, which translates into savings of over one hundred million dollars annual...|$|E
40|$|Crew {{scheduling}} is {{an extensive}} and important subject for scheduling problems in optimization. It {{is concerned with}} the assignment of crew members to create work timetables (schedules) for an organization depending on the requirements and aims of the organization. There are several factors that have to be taken into consideration to decide the assignment of crew members. Apart from the required number of staff and required skills of employees, assignments should conform to the rules and regulations of the specific sector. The basic input of most crew scheduling problems is the set of crew members and the set of tasks that should be carried out according to the definition of tasks and skill levels of employees. The common features of these problems are that the tasks should be completed in the defined time window, in an actual task environment by taking into consideration the legal and contractual requirements. According to these characteristics, the solution methods searches for the best allocation of staff members in general. In this study we aim to evaluate reasonable solution methods for a cost minimization problem based on changes in the scheduling of vessel crews. The focus of this study will be based on crew scheduling in transportation settings specific to the maritime industry. The crew cost for this transportation cost problem depends on different variables. The cost includes the salary of the crew members, accommodation and food expenses and movement cost of crew members. Movement cost is calculated with respect to the travel expenses from a gateway city near their home to the departure port of the ship, airfare, visa expenses, hotel, meals, and crew members return expenses after their duty. As a result, crew cost is a comparatively significant cost factor for shipping companies [25]. Apart from the importance of the crew costs, crew scheduling problems are inherently intractable problems and this feature makes them attractive as optimization problems. To obtain an optimal solution with a solver in a reasonable time is not generally possible for problems of a realistic size. Most of the crew scheduling problems are known to be NP-Hard problems; as the size of the problem becomes larger, the complexity level of this kind of problems also increases. Even though crew scheduling problems in the transportation industry have a significant place in the scheduling literature, maritime crew scheduling problems are not as popular as airline settings. There are several reasons to explain the lack of studies for crew scheduling problems in vessels. These reasons {{can be explained by the}} long planning time horizons in maritime context, lower visibility of the shipping industry compared to rail, road and air, and the higher level of uncertainty and the greater need for recovery schedules [10]. In our study, instead of scheduling the crew members from scratch, we are more interested in how the current schedule could be recovered in the face of environmental uncertainty. Since crew schedules in vessels tend to be affected by environmental factors, such schedules need to be adjusted or updated. This feature changes the basis of the study to the field of recovery scheduling problems. Barnhart et. al. [4] give a place to the recovery problem in their study by presenting a crew recovery model developed by Lettovsky et. al. [38]. In this model, the cost of adjusted pairings, reserve crew, <b>deadheaded</b> crews and cancellation are aimed to be minimized. However, there are not too many studies for the recovery problem: some heuristic search algorithms, dynamic programming algorithm, and column generation methods play a role in the existing literature [4]. A good survey paper is provided by [12] which includes recent disruption management (recovery) methods in the airline industry. The authors give comprehensive information about the recovery problem in an airline setting with respect to different objective functions for the different resources of the disruptions. Wei et. al. [51] developed a multi commodity network flow for the crew management problem during airline irregular operations. Their objective is to minimize the cost of returning to the original schedule. They gave a depth-first branch-and-bound search algorithm to solve their set covering formulation for this problem. Their algorithm provides flexibility in terms of the constraints defined by business. Guo [27] has a different approach to the recovery problem. His study is aimed at minimizing the changes in the current schedule. The problem is formulated as a set partitioning problem and he used both a column generation approach and a hybrid of a genetic algorithm with a local search. In relation to the above studies, it is hard to have a completely deterministic data set and construct a model without making strong assumptions. Since we aim to obtain practical results for a real life problem, we want to explore the source of uncertainty in this problem setting and to look for contributions from robust optimization...|$|E
