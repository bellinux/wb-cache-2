Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E

5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, {{such as the}} solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg {{with a number of}} live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in <b>her</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{utilizing}} anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) {{as sources of}} NO and murine fibroblasts expressing the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (<b>HER</b> 14 <b>cells),</b> we showed that tyrosine phosphorylation {{of a set of}} proteins (126, 56 and 43 kDa) was stimulated when cells were incubated with either SNP or SNAP and abolished by Methylene Blue and oxyhaemoglobin. Inhibition by Methylene Blue suggested an involvement of cyclic GMP in the process, which was evidenced by the effects of 8 -bromo cyclic GMP. This analogue of cyclic GMP stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the same set of proteins phosphorylated after incubation with the NO source. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the same set of proteins was stimulated when cells were incubated simultaneously with SNP and EGF, showing that NO also potentiates EGF-evoked tyrosine kinase activity in <b>HER</b> 14 <b>cells.</b> However, stimulation of the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor, above the levels obtained for EGF alone, was not observed under those conditions. Additionally, we investigated the effects of NO on EGF-receptor tyrosine phosphatase activities in <b>HER</b> 14 <b>cells.</b> Increasing concentrations of NO correlate with a gradual inhibition of these activities in <b>HER</b> 14 <b>cells,</b> either in intact cells or in cell lysates. Taken together, these observations suggest that NO modulates tyrosine phosphorylation in <b>HER</b> 14 <b>cells...</b>|$|R

5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
