5|$|If a cell {{containing}} the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot {{be in the}} table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not present in the dictionary.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell.

The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not present.|$|E

In addition, the no-charge semicircle formally called the restricted area arc was also created. The change took effect in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key.

5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' <b>key</b> <b>is</b> pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register <b>key</b> <b>is</b> a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register <b>key</b> <b>is</b> harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} involved in this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that <b>Key</b> <b>is</b> under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a <b>key</b> <b>is</b> computed by using each byte {{of the key}} as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's <b>key</b> <b>is</b> its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} <b>key</b> <b>is</b> to be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after {{the time of}} revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The <b>key</b> <b>is</b> to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
50|$|For each correct response, {{one of the}} bad <b>keys</b> <b>was</b> {{eliminated}} from the pool of nine.

40|$|Transformation of {{a source}} schema with its {{conforming}} data to a target schema with its conforming data {{is an important}} activity in XML as two schemas in XML can represent same real world information. Specifically in XML data integration, transformation of a source to a target is regarded as an important task. An XML source schema can often be defined with XML <b>key</b> which <b>is</b> an important integrity constraint. Thus when a source schema with <b>keys</b> <b>is</b> transformed, <b>keys</b> need to <b>be</b> transformed as they are defined on the schema. Moreover {{there is a need}} to investigate whether the transformed <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> valid and preserved. In this paper, we study how XML <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> transformed, and whether the transformed <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> valid and preserved to the target schema. Towards this problem, we firstly define XML keys and their satisfactions. We then show how the XML <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> transformed using transformation operations. Finally, we study the key preservation property of important XML transformation operators. We show that the important XML transformation operations <b>are</b> <b>key</b> preserving with necessary and sufficient conditions. ...|$|R
