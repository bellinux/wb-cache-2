25|$|Pollock v.

The decision was superseded in 1913 by the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A separate holding regarding the taxation of <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> on certain bonds was overruled by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of South Carolina v. Baker.|$|E
25|$|The Debs Memorial Radio Fund {{launched}} its fundraising campaign with a mailing of 15,000 letters soliciting {{funds for the}} establishment of a Socialist Party-owned radio station. This first round of solicitation brought in just over $2650 — barely more than 1% of the declared goal $250,000 sought for the project. The Radio Fund's trustees estimated cost of launching a station at $100,000 and hoped to invest the balance to generate sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> to allow for perpetual operations. While this grand vision of substantial funding proved overly optimistic, the necessary funds for the acquisition of a station were successfully raised from party members and sympathetic labor unions during the first half of 1927.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that {{the savings and loan crisis}} was in part caused by this problem, that the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of the {{financial}} crisis in September 2008, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained. The preferred stock yielded an annual interest rate of 10% earning Berkshire $500 million in <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> per year. Berkshire also received warrants to purchase 43.5 million shares with a strike price of $115 per share, which were exercisable at any time for a five year term. Goldman maintained the right to purchase back the preferred stock and in March 2011 exercised this right paying $5.5 billion to Berkshire (the preferred stock could only be purchased back at a 10% premium). The warrants have been exercised and Berkshire holds 3% of the share capital of Goldman Sachs. Profit on the preferred stock was estimated at $1.8 billion and exercising the warrants has yielded a profit of more than $2 billion (Berkshire still owns shares in Goldman Sachs so the entire profit cannot be quantified).|$|E
25|$|In 1895 the United States Supreme Court, in its {{ruling in}} Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., held a tax based on {{receipts}} {{from the use}} of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on rents from real estate, on <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes dividend income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations). Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax. Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical {{from the time of the}} Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).|$|E
25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (there was hardly any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 percent of the Gross National Product at the time). This debt burden rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal debt burden militated against other provinces agreeing to fiscal reform. Fiscal reform was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their <b>interest</b> <b>income,</b> but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E
