50|$|Pyrargyrite is a sulfosalt mineral {{consisting}} of silver sulfantimonide, Ag3SbS3. Known also as <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ore</b> or ruby silver, {{it is an}} important source of the metal.|$|E
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{famous in the}} 18th century for its finds of rare and exotic {{minerals}}, which were sold inter alia through a mineral depot in Clausthal. Especially sought after were the silver minerals pyrargyrite (<b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ore),</b> dyscrasite (silver antimony) and pyrostilpnite (feuerblende), the calcite crystals in various forms (paper spar - Papierspat, leaf spar - Blätterspat, cannon spar - Kanonenspat, cube spar - Würfelspat, composite spar - Compositenspat), analcime crystals (Andreasberger Tautropfen), pink apophyllite, scherbenkobalt (native arsenic), ganomatite (Gänsekötigerz) breithauptite, native antimony, chlorargyrite (Buttermilcherz) and others. The very rare mineral samsonite was named after the pit.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} allied to, and {{isomorphous}} with, the corresponding sulfarsenide known as proustite or light <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ore.</b> Ruby <b>silver</b> or <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ore</b> (German Rotgiiltigerz) was mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546, {{but the two}} species so closely resemble one another {{that they were not}} completely distinguished until chemical analyses of both were made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{color of}} {{pyrargyrite}} is usually greyish-black and the lustre metallic-adamantine; large crystals are opaque, but small ones and thin splinters are deep ruby-red by transmitted light, hence the name, from the Greek pyr and argyros, [...] "fire-silver" [...] in allusion to color and silver content, given by E. F. Glocker in 1831. The streak is purplish-red, thus differing markedly from the scarlet streak of proustite and affording a ready means of distinguishing the two minerals. The Mohs hardness is 2.75, {{and the specific}} gravity 5.85. The refractive indices (nω=3.084 nε=2.881) and birefringence (δ=0.203) are very high. There is no very distinct cleavage and the fracture is conchoidal. The mineral occurs in metalliferous veins with calcite, argentiferous galena, native silver, native arsenic, &c. The best crystallized specimens are from Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz, Freiberg in Saxony, and Guanajuato in Mexico. It is not uncommon in many silver mines in the United States, but rarely as distinct crystals; {{and it has been}} found in some Cornish mines.Although the <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ores</b> afford a good example of isomorphism, they rarely form mixtures; pyrargyrite rarely contains as much as 3% of arsenic replacing antimony, and {{the same is true of}} antimony in proustite. Dimorphous with pyrargyrite and proustite respectively are the rare monoclinic species pyrostilpnite or fireblende (Ag3SbS3) and xanthoconite (Ag3AsS3): these four minerals thus form an isodimorphous group.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to raise a}} regiment of Walloon Guards was taken on 17 October 1702 by Philip V of Spain and the new unit arrived in Spain in December the following year. They were linked with the Spanish Guards (Gardes Espagnoles) raised shortly before. Both regiments had the same organisation, disciplinary regulations and uniforms of <b>dark</b> blue, <b>red</b> and <b>silver.</b> The model for both were the French Guards (Gardes Françaises) of the French Maison du Roi, a detachment of whom were sent to Spain in 1703 to act as instructors.|$|R
50|$|Proustite is a sulfosalt mineral {{consisting}} of; silver sulfarsenide, Ag3AsS3, known also {{as light}} <b>red</b> <b>silver</b> or ruby <b>silver</b> <b>ore,</b> {{and an important}} source of the metal. It is closely allied to the corresponding sulfantimonide, pyrargyrite, from which it was distinguished by the chemical analyses of Joseph L. Proust (1754-1826) in 1804, after whom the mineral received its name.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{amalgamation}} {{was first}} used on <b>silver</b> <b>ores</b> {{with the development of}} the patio process in Mexico in 1557.
