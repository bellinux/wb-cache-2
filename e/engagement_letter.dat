5000|$|The {{alternative}} and legal [...] "comp check" [...] {{is not a}} comp check at all but an appraisal. If an appraiser believes a value for a particular property can be reliably determined without leaving the office and inspecting the property, and that the necessary approaches to value to determine a reliable opinion can be completed from a desk, an appraiser can accept the [...] "comp check" [...] as an appraisal request, and provide an opinion of value for a subject property verbally. An <b>engagement</b> <b>letter</b> (i.e., a detailed order identifying the user {{and the use of}} a request) for such an assignment is necessary, and a written workfile with a signed certification must be maintained by the appraiser on this report, even if the results are verbally reported. This workfile must contain all data necessary to support the opinion of value provided. Such an appraisal is wrought with liabilities and the competent appraiser will refuse any such assignment unless the house being appraised and its immediate market are very well known by the appraiser. Because any such report would have to be made based on extraordinary assumptions in regards to condition and quality of the house, the appraiser, even when the area and subject property are well known, is wise to make such a report based on the hypothetical condition that an inspection was made, and the report [...] "subject to a physical inspection" [...] open to change should differences in assumptions be observed. Most of the better appraisers will not complete this type of an assignment, even if they are very familiar with the area, because there is more work to it than meets the eye and brokers expect it free of charge. What most mortgage brokers do not realize, however, is that a comp search appraisal will often not fit their needs, as an appraisal for lending purposes with a different scope of work can reasonably result in a significantly different value, and the direction of the difference is not predictable.|$|E

Alwa recalls his mother's death, and how he had hoped that Lulu would replace her, while Lulu observes that his father put her on the stage in the hope that somebody rich would marry her and take her off his hands. Lulu emerges in a ballet dress, Alwa appears smitten and they drink. At the sound of a bell, Lulu leaves to take the stage. Alwa watches her leave and then contemplates writing an opera based on Lulu's life, but as he draws out the scenes he comes to the conclusion that they are too gruesome. Applause can be heard, and the Prince enters and reveals his wish to marry Lulu. It is apparent her sudden fame is due to favourable reviews published by Schön. Suddenly the bell starts ringing incessantly and an uproar is heard off stage. Alwa appears startled and Lulu enters suddenly, flinging herself in a chair, followed by the dresser and theatre manager who explain that she fainted. She implies it was because she saw Schön with his fiancée, Mit seiner Braut! (With his bride!) whereupon Schön himself enters and Lulu refuses to continue because his fiancée is in the audience. All try to persuade Lulu to return to the stage, in a sextet Das hättest Du Dir besser erspart! (This you could have spared yourself!), then Schön dismisses the company leaving Lulu and himself alone. He admonishes her, Wie kannst Du die Szene gegen mich ausspielen? (how can you play this scene to get me?), they argue and she taunts him with the Prince and his inability to break off their relationship. It is apparent that he is torn between the two women, and she begins to exploit his weakness, compelling him to write a letter that she dictates, breaking off the <b>engagement</b> (<b>Letter</b> duet: Sehr geehrtes Fräulein …; Most respected Fräulein ...).

First, it briefly summarizes the history of auditing throughout the world and in the Czech Republic. It analyses the meaning and objectives of the statutory audit and explains the triangular relationship between the auditor, management of the entity and its owners. The description of a typical course of assurance engagement is accompanied by cautionary advice for intricate aspects of acceptance of an audit engagement and the preparation of <b>engagement</b> <b>letter.</b> Attention is paid to materiality levels used during the statutory audit and to the expression that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the entity. Different types of auditor's report are distinguished and a variety of errors frequently made not only by users of financial statements from the common public but also by experts participating in management of audited entities is mentioned as well. The three chapters dealing with auditor's liability discuss the civil, disciplinary and criminal issues related to assurance activities. As regards auditors' civil [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen many changes in audit {{liability}} regimes of the US and the UK, and more {{may be on the}} way. These include LLP status for audit firms, proportional liability, and the introduction of various forms of liability caps through contract in <b>engagement</b> <b>letters.</b> These changes may affect audit quality, price and profitability, the organization of the market for audit services, as well as domestic and cross-national mechanisms for regulation of this market. What have been, or will be the consequences of these changes? Will the auditors, who advocate many of these reforms, benefit from them? Will the investors, who advocate other reforms, benefit from them? Answers to these questions are relevant to policy decisions at hand. We analyze the recent changes and the proposals for future changes on the basis of available research on the market for audit services, including some studies commissioned by regulators. We find it difficult to establish a correspondence between the self-interest of the advocates of various changes and the observed and anticipated effects of such changes. More evidence is needed to inform the debate in the corridors of power. Such evidence could be obtained by requiring audit firms to publish information about their true litigation costs. Moreover, the regulatory process might benefit from somewhat greater reliance on market forces. Auditor liability, U. K. and U. S. comparison, International accounting...|$|R

40|$|The auditor {{ratification}} vote allows shareholders {{to voice}} their opinions on audit-related issues. Motivated by regulatory concerns about third party proxy advisors that provide summarized voting recommendations to subscribing shareholders, this study investigates: i) the determinants of proxy advisors 2 ̆ 7 recommendations on auditor ratification (For or Against), ii) whether these recommendations affect voting outcomes, and iii) whether an Against recommendation leads to subsequent changes in the auditor-client relationship. The results indicate that proxy advisors {{are more likely to}} recommend that shareholders vote Against auditor ratification when the <b>engagement</b> <b>letter</b> limits the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s liability, when the auditor provides excessive nonaudit services, and when audit quality appears to be low.

Finally, when using a matched sample design, neither proxy advisor recommendations nor shareholder voting outcomes are associated with subsequent changes in the auditor-client relationship, suggesting that companies do not respond to voiced concerns about the auditor. These findings should be of interest to researchers examining the impact of the auditor ratification vote and to regulators evaluating the involvement of proxy advisors in auditor ratification...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} what variables are significant in predicting the type of professional liability insurance, if any, an accounting firm would have. The three dependent variables are firms that: purchased commercial liability insurance, are members of a captive company or risk retention group, and have no commercial liability insurance coverage. Independent variables include characteristics of the firm (form of the business, size of the firm) and of the client (recently merged clients, clients that are financial institutions). The study uses the multinomial logit model with maximum likelihood. The Hausman-McFadden test is used to test for independence of irrelevant alternatives. Various methods are used to detect multicollinearity, the most sophisticated of which is the Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch test. Correlation tables and stepwise backward elimination are also used. The seven significant variables identified by the model as useful for predictors are: (1) Is the firm a sole practitioner? (2) What is the size of the firm?

40|$|This {{article is}} part of an {{exchange}} including Anthony Alfieri and William Simon in the Georgetown Law Journal on the implications of law firms 2 ̆ 7 increasing reliance on the concept of risk management as the focus of efforts to ensure ethical conduct by lawyers. A risk management program involves the adoption of various policies and procedures designed to minimize conduct that may lead to individual and firm liability. Conflicts checking procedures, standard terms in <b>engagement</b> <b>letters,</b> and the requirement of a second signature by a disinterested partner on legal opinions are but a few of such measures. On one hand, the risk management paradigm reflects appreciation of the importance of situational incentives and pressures in shaping behavior in organizational settings. This is an advance over conceptions of legal ethics that assume that behavior is principally a function of individual character. Law firms are now major business enterprises, and their systems of rewards and sanctions, as well as their cultures, necessarily influence the conduct of those who work in them. Attending {{to the ways in which}} these influences can reinforce or discourage certain types of behavior can help firms establish and maintain environments that enhance the likelihood that lawyers will act ethically. On the other hand, a risk management approach risks inculcating an instrumental view of legal and ethical provisions. To the extent that it conceptualizes ethics as a matter of avoiding liability, risk management may foster the attitude of Holmes 2 ̆ 7 s bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which... knowledge [of the law] enables him to predict. The bad man wants to avoid punishment, but has no commitment to legal compliance as a good in itself. This can lead to an impoverished view of law and ethics, in which the choice of behavior is contingent on the costs and benefits of a given course of action. This tension in the risk management model has been examined in the context of corporate legal compliance programs, and law firms may draw useful lessons from that research. Social psychologists and management theorists have identified complex connections among program characteristics, group dynamics, individual perceptions and motives, and employee behavior in the business setting. In particular, they have suggested that instrumental and values-based programs proceed on different premises and contribute to compliance in different ways. Instrumental programs can be effective by affecting employee cost-benefit calculations, while values-based programs can foster appropriate behavior because the employee identifies with the values that this behavior expresses. Scholars suggest that compliance programs with both dimensions generally are necessary, but integrating them into a single program requires careful consideration of how they may interact. The article closes by suggesting that this research on corporate programs may offer useful insights for law firms. It cautions, however, that applying this research will need to take account of the ways in which law firms both resemble and are different from typical business corporations...|$|R

40|$|With the {{financial}} crisis, {{socially responsible investment}} (SRI) has gained attention. SRI designates a variety of rationales and techniques for including non-financial criteria into investment decisions. One technique of SRI consists of investors engaging with investee corporations on issues of concern. The aim is twofold. First, the investor hopes {{to get more information}} on corporate policies and practices with regard to allegations of improper behaviour, made by third parties (NGOs, unions, press). Second, the investor tries to influence these practices by signalling investor concern to top management over certain issues. However, the engagement process itself remains opaque, especially in Europe where shareholder activism (SRI activists voting at AGM) is relatively unknown, and where ‘soft engagement’ (behind-closed-doors-dialogue) is more popular. This article takes an organizational rhetoric approach to provide insights into the complexities and ambiguities that are at play in the interaction between representatives of SRI investors and corporations. We use data from an investor <b>engagement</b> process (<b>letters</b> to and from management and boards of investee corporations) on three cases of corporate activities in Myanmar. Our findings are that the investor initiative has a hard time getting investees to answer a number of straightforward questions about the investee's risk exposure and risk management with regard to being involved in breaches of International Labour Organization core conventions. From our organizational rhetoric analysis we offer plausible explanations for this both on investor side (ambiguity of intent, lack of credibility on investor side) and on corporate side (ambiguity of audience to respond to, lack of engagement experience, the assumption that moral arguments are expected rather than proper risk management) ...|$|R
