500|$|The {{story was}} {{negatively}} received by several critics, {{with a number}} of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; one critic praised the original idea but criticised its [...] "Bollywoodization". The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite Ra.One being promoted as a children's film. Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's [...] "incoherently hackneyed morality". A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a [...] "mess"; one review commented, [...] "It's convenient to say that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, but I would say that I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
500|$|The 808 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} inventions in popular music. According to Sound on Sound, the machine [...] "spawned an industry of clones and sample libraries"; samples of its sounds are common in modern music software. Flavorwire wrote that [...] "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own — you know the sounds even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea what a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts." [...] The New Yorker wrote in 2015 that the 808 is the bedrock of the modern [...] "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that [...] "embraces and fetishizes... street music from the past." [...] According to Slate, it was instrumental in pop music's shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to [...] "thinking in terms of sequences, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum." ...|$|E

2500|$|July 12, 2011 – Days after gaining {{entry into}} the 3,000 hit club, Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter elected to sit out of the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game citing [...] "physical and {{emotional}} exhaustion" [...] and recovery from {{a recent visit to}} the disabled list. Jeter, who throughout his career had been praised by people in and out of baseball for good behavior, was criticized by some players and officials including Mets outfielder Carlos Beltrán. Beltran stated that [...] "I do believe, as a ballplayer, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> injuries, you should be here...the fans are the ones that vote for you and want to see you here." [...] Mets shortstop José Reyes, who also was injured, also opined on the incident saying [...] "I want to come no matter what happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Wolk {{said the}} {{earliest}} Consumer Guide columns were generally brief and detailed, but [...] "within a few years, though, he developed his particular gift for 'power, wit and economy,' a phrase {{he used to}} describe the Ramones in a dead-on 37-word review of Leave Home." [...] In his opinion, the Consumer Guide reviews were [...] "an enormous pleasure to read slowly, as writing, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> particular interest in pop music. And if you do happen to have more than a little interest in pop music, they're a treasure." [...] Fans of Christgau's [...] "Consumer Guide" [...] like to share lines from their favorite reviews, Wolk writes, citing [...] "Sting wears his sexual resentment on his chord changes like a closet 'American Woman' fan" [...] (from Christgau's review of the 1983 Police album Synchronicity); [...] "Calling Neil Tennant a bored wimp is like accusing Jackson Pollock of making a mess" [...] (reviewing the 1987 Pet Shop Boys album Actually); and [...] "Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home" [...] (in a review of Prince's 1980 album Dirty Mind).|$|E
2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never {{tell you what you}} should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E

The agency that insures banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) says about 40 percent of Baltimore households are unbanked or underbanked. That means they use check-cashing outlets, money orders, and payday or auto title loans, instead of formal banking services. These alternative services can come with high fees and a reputation for predatory practices. This hour, University of Baltimore law professor Cassandra Jones Havard tells us {{why so many people}} are excluded from formal financial institutions, and why brick-and-mortar banks are vital to communities...|$|R

2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her. [...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
