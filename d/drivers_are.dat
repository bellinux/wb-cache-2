5|$|By 2008, Eurostar's {{environmental}} credentials {{had become}} highly developed and promoted. In 2006 Eurostar's Environment Group was set up, {{with the aim}} of making changes in the Eurostar services' daily running to decrease the environmental impact, the organisation setting itself a target of reducing carbon emissions per passenger journey by 25% by 2012. <b>Drivers</b> <b>are</b> trained in techniques to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and lighting has been minimised; the provider of the bulk of the energy for the Channel Tunnel has been switched to nuclear power stations in France.|$|E
5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. <b>Drivers</b> <b>are</b> required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other racing series such as Formula One, Formula E has a specific qualifying mode, {{in which the}} twenty <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> divided up into four groups, leaving enough space on track for everyone to produce lap times without interference by other drivers. Each group had ten minutes on track and the fastest time of each driver determined the grid position. A lottery determined which drivers started in which group. With five-minute breaks between the groups, qualifying had an overall length of 55 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Its two <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> a 180mm paper woofer and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a {{flat sheet}} of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. Against the black finish of the cabinet, the white bass/mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic {{feature of the}} product.|$|E
5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. <b>Drivers</b> <b>are</b> often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, elk and moose crossing the highway {{add to the}} risk compared to urban highways.

5|$|Several {{private and}} public motor {{carriers}} such as Frito-Lay, United Parcel Service, and Werner Enterprises, have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> {{in compliance with the}} federal regulations, to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment. EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged. Any violation of the HOS will automatically be recorded and reported to the company. The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E
5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> charged {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths they pass through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|<b>Drivers</b> <b>are</b> {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score points for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E

5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game modes {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their scores are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E
5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined {{from the surface of the}} Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively).
