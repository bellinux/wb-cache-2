500|$|Stardust {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most publications, both on its original release {{and for its}} various reissues. Rolling Stone praised the album: [...] "For all the sleek sophistication of the material, Stardust is as down-home as the Legion dance. Heard coast to coast in lounges and on elevator soundtracks, these tunes {{have become part of}} the folk music of exurban America. And that's the way Nelson plays them—spare and simple, with a jump band's verve and a storyteller's love of a good tale. By offering these songs, he's displaying the tools of a journeyman musician's trade—worn smooth and polished by constant use—and when he lays them out this way, they <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> like works of art. Willie Nelson may be acknowledging both his own and country music's debt to Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but he's also showing these hallowed musical institutions how the country makes their music its own".|$|E
500|$|At first, Jim's and Dwight's sales call {{appears to}} be a fiasco, but it is soon clear that the joint force of Jim's straight-and-honest sales approach, along with Dwight's aggressive, erratic tactics, is a very {{successful}} partnership. Ryan asks Stanley if he could lead on this call so Stanley can critique him, which Stanley obliges. [...] However, Ryan freezes up and fails when he realizes that Stanley's clients are all black. [...] Stanley laughs at an annoyed Ryan during the entire trip back to the office. [...] Phyllis and Karen first stop at a beauty parlor, emerging with gaudy makeovers. [...] Their sales call is a success because, as Phyllis knew, the client obviously likes women with that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> as evidenced by the photo of his wife. Returning to the office, Phyllis tells Karen that she's pleased that Jim got over his crush on Pam. Karen confronts Jim with this information, and he reassures her that his crush has passed.|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E

For The Long Goodbye, {{he insisted that}} Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects. Zsigmond states that Altman [...] "wanted to do something different" [...] in this film, {{and told him he}} [...] "wanted the camera to move—all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side." [...] Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, [...] "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working." ...|$|E

One of his chamber of commerce associates recalled that Fitzmorris ran committee meetings [...] "railroad-style. When an agenda was scheduled for 9 a.m., he would look at his railroad watch and start the meeting at 9 a.m. sharp (not 9:01) - even if I was the only member who had shown up on time. If the meeting was scheduled for one hour, Jimmy Fitz would look at his watch again at 10 a.m. sharp and summarily close the meeting, even if a pontificating member was in mid-sentence! When people came in late, he would give them the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> that only railroad men give late passengers sprinting after a moving train." ...|$|E
2500|$|Video game creators have {{realized}} the asset of incorporating supercouple romances within their products by stringing together epic stories {{of love and}} intrigue. While writing epic romances into video games {{is not a new}} phenomenon, the idea of capturing a video game player through emotionally charged moments via the death of a hero's lover in order to produce feelings of attachment to the fictional environment has expanded, especially within action-adventure/role-playing games (RPGs). The goal is to make the gamer actually become emotionally invested in the characters and their actions, ultimately resulting in heightened gaming experience. Video game designer Peter Molyneux, when speaking of the main component he wanted in his game Fable 2, spoke of more than just the romantic aspect, stating, [...] "We want you to feel loved. You can have sex and you can have a baby. That baby will grow up and will <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> like you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since his {{departure}} Greg {{has become an}} iconic villain on the soap. His romance with Caroline {{has been described as}} one of Shortland Streets most memorable couples. Writer, Rachel Lang, thought Balme was perfect for the role, stating:"I was at the bank and there was this guy over at the counter and I thought, 'ooh he looks dodgy', he had that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> about him, he's quite a chameleon." [...] A reviewer of the soap stated in 2000 that Greg should be brought back because he made the show addictive with his [...] "badboy" [...] ways. Balmes portrayal was so realistic, a pharmacist refused him service whilst he was on the show fearing he was drug seeking. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. His final scene with Caroline has been voted by fans as one of the show's most iconic moments.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impression of}} two paintings by the Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershøi (1864 - 1916) on Rilke, "Self-Portrait" from 1889 and "Portrait of a Young Girl" from 1892, which is {{a portrait of the}} artist's fiancée Ida Ilstedt. Rilke admired the Danish poet Jens Peter Jacobsen (1847 - 1885). The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> serves as a common point of reference both of the visual arts and of literature. When he visited Copenhagen during his stay in Sweden in 1904 Rilke was influenced by his admiration for Jens Peter Jacobsen. Rilke had gained access to the art collection of Alfred Bramsen, Hammershøi's patron. Thus he got the opportunity to see others of Hammershøi's works. Here comes the analysis of two paintings. The conscious <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>of</b> the two persons was what Rilke was interested in. In "Self-Portrait" a concentrated and objective view; in the Portrait of Ida Ilsted an innocent and meaningless open view somewhere between inside and outside. The two portraits thus thematize the conscious view that Rilke admired at Jacobsen. The works highlight the importance <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> view in later works of Rilke and in the Letters on Cézanne...|$|R

40|$|The {{films that}} I make are part documentary, part film essay, part visual poem. They are created {{out of a}} series of up to 30 {{drawings}} that are animated. The process from research to completion takes about 2 years, {{and at the end of}} it there is a film and a number of drawings that can be exhibited. This paper emerges out of the realisation that in the different stages of making a drawing and a film—from planning a drawing and seeking an image as a starting point through to the finished film being projected onto a screen in a gallery—I am looking at the image in different ways. There is a close-up <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> when I am drawing and a reflective <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> when I step back to take stock. There is a way <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at darks and lights as they are built up that is different from the way <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at the lines crossing the edges of the grid being used to transfer an image to the drawing paper. Seeing the drawings on the wall of my studio is different from seeing the same drawings in a museum setting...|$|R
