40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the impacts of the new {{ecological}} paradigm, environmental collective efficacy, environmental knowledge, and collectivism on the <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention of Korean and Chinese consumers. Although some studies have researched the relationship between cultural influences and <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> behaviour, {{a study on the}} moderating effect of collectivism on the formation of <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention is rarely found. Therefore, based on 357 consumers in Korea and 398 consumers in China, this study proposes a new model of <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention and empirically tests a model using moderated regression analysis (MRA). The results show that the new ecological paradigm, environmental collective efficacy, environmental knowledge, and collectivism are direct antecedents of <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention in China. In particular, collectivism positively moderates the relationship between environmental collective efficacy and <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention in China. However, the results from Korean consumers show that collectivism has neither a direct impact nor moderating impact on <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention. However, it was found that environmental collective efficacy and environmental knowledge have direct impacts on <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention in Korea.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to address}} the <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> gap by: {{exploring}} environmentally conscious consumers’ mental representation of the barriers responsible for the <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> gap; assessing which barriers are perceived as the most relevant in hampering the <b>purchase</b> of <b>green</b> products for environmentally conscious consumers; and investigating the relationships among these barriers. Although consumers are increasingly concerned about environmental deterioration, the current market share of green products remains fairly low. Design/methodology/approach – An introspective qualitative study is conducted; 51 environmentally conscious consumers showing a <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> gap are interviewed, and the data are analysed with a cognitive mapping technique (Decision Explorer software) and Freeman’ structural indices (UCINET software). Findings – Higher price and scarce availability of green products are the main barriers to <b>green</b> <b>purchasing.</b> However, consumers’ perceptions of price and availability may vary by changing other barriers (e. g. green products displacement inside the store and in-store communication). Originality/value – This work reconstructs the decisional premises of environmentally conscious consumers’ choices to not <b>purchase</b> <b>green</b> products, identifies the most relevant barriers to <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> behaviour and the relationships between these barriers.

This study applies four original concepts – green perceived value, green perceived risk, green trust, and <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intentions – to develop an integral model to enhance <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intentions. In addition, this research employs an empirical study by means of the questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and to explore its managerial implications. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to verify the research framework. The empirical results show that perceived value will positively affect trust green and <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention, while perceived risk negatively affects the good green from them. Furthermore, this study shows that the relationship between purchase intention of green and two of their predecessors - the green felt values and perceived risks of green - the green partially mediated by trust. Therefore, environmentally friendly goods with efficient marketing to increase the perceived value of the green and to reduce the perceived risk is beneficial to increase the confidence of green and <b>green</b> <b>purchase</b> intention.

The {{primary purpose of}} the study is to understand the green consumer behaviour in a community so that the findings would fill the knowledge gap in green marketing and facilitate marketers to formulate their green marketing strategies. Hopefully, green marketing would become an effective measure for sustainable development. The study takes a quantitative approach and uses self-completion questionnaire to obtain data from a student sample by convenient sampling. Two hundred and sixteen completed questionnaires were collected for analysis. Besides descriptive statistics, structural equation modelling was used to test the mediator effect of environmental concern, and the moderator effect of materialism on <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> behaviour. The findings support that environmental concern is a mediator of the relation between environmental beliefs and <b>green</b> <b>purchasing</b> behaviour. This may explain why environmentally responsible purchase is much less than the level of environmental awareness.
