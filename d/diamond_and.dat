5|$|Mercyful Fate was {{originally}} formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1981, following {{the dissolution of}} the band Brats. Brats had been a punk/metal band, featuring future Mercyful Fate members, vocalist King <b>Diamond,</b> <b>and</b> guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner. After two studio albums and several line-up changes (including the addition of <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> the departure of Denner), <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Shermann began writing new material that was much heavier than any of Brats' previous work. The band's record label CBS was not pleased with the material, and demanded they stop singing in English and become more commercial. As a result, <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Shermann quit the group and went on to form Mercyful Fate. After several line-up changes and semi-professional demo tapes, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982. This line-up, consisting of King Diamond, Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen, drummer Kim Ruzz and guitarist Michael Denner, would go on to record the group's first two studio albums.|$|E
5|$|After Storm {{departed}} ECW, Psaltis {{became a}} color commentator on ECW pay-per-views {{and the television}} series ECW on TNN. On December 3, 2000 at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, {{as part of a}} new angle, she announced that she would become the manager of the winner of the opening match pitting Simon <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Swinger against Christian York and Joey Matthews. Although York and Matthews won the bout, Psaltis opted to join forces with <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Swinger, whom she managed until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{hardness}} of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> {{its ability}} to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. Therefore, the crystallographic structure of the diamond to be cut is analyzed using X-ray diffraction to choose the optimal cutting directions.|$|E

5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a <b>diamond,</b> <b>and</b> may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{had good}} {{relations}} with other towns, Silver Reef had the usual labor disputes between mining camp wage laborers and mine owners. After a major dispute with the Stormont Mining Company, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed to support wages. Gambling, prostitution, and shootouts were also commonplace. One shootout involved Town Marshal Johnny <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> mine guard Jack Truby. Tensions between <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Truby temporarily shut down the Kinner mine. Truby was hired by Colonel Enos Wall, foreman {{and owner of the}} Kinner, to guard the mine until told otherwise. Diamond went to the Kinner mine to serve the closure warrant, but Truby refused to allow Diamond into the mine, and forced Diamond to leave the property immediately.|$|E
5|$|Both Neil <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Arnold Schwarzenegger lobbied {{hard for}} the role, but were ignored. James Caan, James Brolin, Lyle Waggoner, Christopher Walken, Nick Nolte, Jon Voight, and Perry King were approached. Kris Kristofferson and Charles Bronson were also {{considered}} for the title role.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, {{the same as that of}} <b>diamond,</b> <b>and</b> is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E

In promotion of the games, Nintendo sold a limited-edition Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, and held a release party celebrating their North American release.|$|E

5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E

5|$|In 1722, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur {{demonstrated}} that iron {{was transformed into}} steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon. In 1772, Antoine Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> found that neither produced any water and that both released {{the same amount of}} carbon dioxide per gram.|$|E

5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD <b>diamond,</b> <b>and</b> though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
