The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having [...] "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme", and by The Times newspaper as [...] "quintessential to being British". Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: [...] "p to the age of 40, I don't think there was a science-fiction book I hadn't read. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> because they're a marvellous way—and a safe way, I might add—of saying nasty things about our own society." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, it was {{revealed}} on-screen that Dylan {{is in fact the}} long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this story! Now, I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular. That’s all you need; good actors performing a good script, and our fabulous new directing team, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> all. I have not been this happy at work in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2007, Abrams {{accepted}} Paramount's {{offer to}} direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer. He explained that he had decided {{to direct the}} film because, after reading the script, he realized that he [...] "would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie." [...] Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [...] I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable. I didn't love Kirk and Spock when I began this journey – but <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was because}} <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> so," [...] {{she said at}} last, brokenly. [...] "That was why it was, even from the first--even before I knew that they--they were all I should ever have. And <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> so!" ...|$|R

60|$|I was touched. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> still, and yet I was {{conscious}} of reservations concerning them. They, too, seemed {{a little on the}} defensive with me, {{and once in a while}} Mary was caustic in her remarks.|$|R
500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them.</b> I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{was born}} in Sweden {{and grew up in}} Canada; she has [...] "conflicting feelings" [...] for the two countries. In an {{interview}} for Toronto Star, she said, [...] "Every time I'm in Canada I feel more Swedish, and every time I'm in Sweden I feel more Canadian. I belong in both places and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences." [...] She has revealed that she is dyslexic and said that it took her [...] "a long time" [...] to learn her lines. [...] "I get horrified when I have to do table reads with the whole cast, because there’s a lot of stuttering coming from me, so I {{have to do a lot}} of prep", she explained. Because of this, she prefers to improvise her lines.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> as well as most fathers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Glad, undoubtedly," [...] replied Hamilton, [...] "but {{sorry to}} part from our old companions there. I had no idea, Harry, that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> all so much.

60|$|I was all alone, {{and it was}} bitter. The roses, much as <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them,</b> {{could not}} give me {{sufficient}} companionship. I wanted the clasp of a human hand, and the love-light in human eyes. And then I fell to thinking of Hugh, though I tried not to.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standoff}} with police lasted for approximately four hours.

2500|$|When Porat {{refused to}} produce the story, Loevy {{resigned}} from Channel 1. It {{was the end of}} a 31-year relationship. Channel 2 bought the rights to the series and Loevy directed it for them. Nevertheless, Loevy insists, [...] "I had no intention of settling accounts with Channel 1. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> like family." [...] But the underlying story behind Murder in Television House had haunted him almost since he began working at Israeli television. It was a story that he needed to tell, and it made no difference where he told it.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the role}} of writing in her life, she says: [...] "I think of writing simply in terms of pleasure. It's the most {{important}} thing in my life, making things. Much as I love my husband and my children, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> only because I am the person who makes these things. I, who I am, is the person that has the project of making a thing. Well, that's putting it pompously – but constructing. I do see it in sort of three-dimensional structures. And because that person does that all the time, that person is able to love all these people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be useless, master.

I could do naught for their comfort.... I thought it would be best for them ..." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: [...] "I left EastEnders because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break. I wanted {{to do other things}} and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. But throughout everything that has happened in my life I have had tremendous support from the people in EastEnders. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line when I left the show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and that is how I feel. It is nice that they have left the door open for Kathy to return." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{has been}} noted for still {{standing}} up today as a [...] "varied and highly entertaining listen" [...] and the band themselves remain proud of the album. Both drummer Don Powell and Holder rate it as their favourite Slade long player. In a 1987 interview, Holder said: [...] "That {{is the only one}} I can really sit down at home and listen to from start to finish." [...] In a 1976 interview, Lea said: [...] "I am really proud of the album and believe it is the best album we have ever done. I have no especial favourite track on the album - <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> all. I'm sure you will see quite an American influence on a lot of the tracks and we believe the hard work we put in, in America had paid dividends." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} recorded at recording studios MSR Studios NYC, Cake Studio, British Grove Studios and the Sotogrande Studios in New York, London and Spain, respectively {{over the course}} of three weeks, although sessions took place throughout 2009 and 2011, although Duffy had been recording songs she had written using her computer and iPod since the release of Rockferry, some of which remained in demo form until the final stages of the recording process. Duffy had formed a songwriting partnership with Albert Hammond for the record, which resulted in nine of the ten final songs released being written, composed and produced by Duffy and Hammond together. Aside from her partnership with Hammond, Duffy also forged collaborative efforts with other musicians who she felt reflected the sound change she was aiming for, including hip hop group The Roots. Duffy {{said in an interview that}} their involvement would be limited to [...] "a rhythm section" [...] going on to say [...] "if you know The Roots you will know just how cool [...] is. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> and they are so cool." [...] She was also heavily involved with the recording process. The Daily Telegraph reports that often Duffy was a perfectionist regarding her songs, and that she often stayed in the studio with her mix engineer to ensure the composition sounded exactly as she wanted. This was often done without the help of Hammond, and she was quoted [...] "this is all I care about. I keep a tight rein when it comes to quality control." [...] Billboard reported in November later that year that Duffy had experimented with a new dance sound, confirming that neither Bernard Butler nor Steve Booker, who produced the bulk of Duffy's debut album, Rockferry, had returned for the record.|$|E
6000|$|... "A whim," [...] {{said the}} Vicomtesse. [...] "I had always written {{twice a year}} either to Monsieur de St. Gre or Antoinette, and {{although}} I had never seen <b>them,</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them.</b> Perhaps it was because they had the patience to read my letters and the manners to say they liked them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of them--I heard--she saw. And knew. Hers! Not for me. I didn't know at first. Perhaps I was jealous.
