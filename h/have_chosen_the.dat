5|$|Before {{the start}} of the championship, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. A country that had selected fewer than the maximum allowed must <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> remaining players prior to {{the start of}} the tournament. After {{the start of the}} tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players to their roster, for a maximum of 25 players. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.|$|E
5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before {{approaching}} {{the town of}} the first Gym Leader, the protagonist first encounters Team Magma/Aqua in the Petalburg Woods, {{where he or she}} rescues a worker from Devon (a company that manufactures Pokéballs) and recovers Devon merchandise. Upon arriving in Fallarbor Town (after defeating the third Gym Leader), the protagonist discovers that Professor Cozmo, an astronomer, has been kidnapped by Magma/Aqua. The protagonist traces them to a cave, Meteor Falls, but is too late to stop them from escaping to Mt. Chimney with a meteorite. The protagonist follows Magma/Aqua to Mt. Chimney where they are preparing to use the meteorite to alter the climate of the region. The protagonist defeats the Team's leader, however, and returns the meteorite to Professor Cozmo. Shortly after the protagonist defeats the fifth Gym Leader (the protagonist's father, the first time such a character appears), Magma/Aqua again attempts to change the region's climate by stealing a Castform, a Pokémon with the ability to change the weather, from the Weather Institute. After the protagonist defeats the sixth Gym Leader, Magma/Aqua steals an orb with the ability to control a legendary Pokémon (Groudon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire). Magma/Aqua then steals a submarine from Captain Stern in Slateport City; the protagonist, however, infiltrates the team's hideout, but fails to prevent the submarine from being used. Magma/Aqua, then travel with the orb to the Seafloor Cavern, where Groudon or Kyogre resides; the team then uses the orb to awaken the legendary Pokémon, but they <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> wrong one and have instead enraged the Pokémon instead of putting it under their thrall. Once awakened, the Pokémon travels to the Cave of Origin and causes a region-wide drought (Ruby) or severe rainstorms (Sapphire). When the protagonist defeats (or captures) the Pokémon, the region's weather returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|St. Catharine's College, Cambridge {{was founded}} on St Catharine’s Day (25 November) 1473 by Robert Woodlark (the then-provost of King's College Cambridge) who sought to create a small {{community}} of scholars who would study exclusively theology and philosophy. Wodelarke may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> name in homage to Catherine of Valois, mother of Henry VI of England, although {{it is more likely}} that it was named as part of the Renaissance cult of Saint Catharine, who was a patron saint of learning. At any rate, the college was ready for habitation and formally founded on Saint Catharine’s Day, 1473.|$|E

25|$|One to be {{influenced}} by Rodion was his own nephew Fondane: according to Ornea, it was Rodion and poet Iacob Ashel Groper who first got Fondane interested in Judaism as a distinct literary subject. Fondane is also believed to <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> title of his column in the Zionist journal Lumea Evree, Idei și oameni ("Ideas and People"), as a quote from and homage to Steuerman. In 1919, the same magazine hosted a philosemitic essay by Romanian cultural promoter Gala Galaction, which deplored the marginalization or persecution of Jewish writers, from Barbu Nemțeanu to Rodion. Excluding reprints in the various Romanian magazines, three posthumous selections of Rodion's work were published, as books, after the war: Frontul Roșu ("The Red Front", sonnets, 1920); Cartea Băiatului meu ("My Boy's Book", memoirs, 1924); Îndepărtări ("Detachments", essays, 1936).|$|E

25|$|From 2021, choice {{will matter}} {{when it comes}} to {{secondary}} school admissions. Pupils will get a choice of six schools and have to rank these choices in order of their preference. If two pupils have the same PSLE score and <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> same school, the one who has put it down as a first choice will get priority over the one who listed it as a second choice. Computerised balloting will be used as a tie-breaker if there are two pupils with the same PSLE score and citizenship status, vying for a place in a school for which they have both listed in the same choice order.To get into the Express stream, pupils need to get a PSLE score of 22 or less, instead of a PSLE aggregate score of around 188 currently. For the Normal (Academic) stream, a score of 25 or less is needed, and for the Normal (Technical) stream, a score of 30 or less.|$|E
25|$|The National Football League Draft, {{also called}} the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event in which the National Football League (NFL) teams select {{eligible}} college football players. It serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given {{a position in the}} drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> best player available.|$|E

She found it [...] "striking" [...] {{that many women}} who had no lesbian experiences indicated {{they were interested in}} sex with women, particularly because the question was not asked. Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents' experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses. Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s, she also acknowledged that women may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> political identity of a lesbian.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Rebecca Epstein Matveyev, Pushkin's [...] "The Stationmaster" [...] {{serves as}} a [...] "thematic subtext, {{as a basis for}} Devushkin's {{literary}} experiments, and as a resource for his epistolary relationship." [...] Both, [...] "The Stationmaster" [...] and [...] "The Overcoat", are mentioned in the letters between Dobroselova and Devushkin. Dostoyevsky may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> epistolary genre to include his personal critical observations, similar to real-life letters between writer and addressee. According to Yakubovich, Dostoyevsky uses Poor Folk as his diary. However, as an external narrator is missing the only source for the character's motivation and personality is available in the letters and Dobroselova's diary. The numerous different voices, that is Devushkin's quotations from stories, his commentaries about these books and his own works, is an example of polyphony. These effects confuse the reader and hide the narrator.|$|E
500|$|Some {{writers have}} focused on Mulberry Streets {{connections}} to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life Mulberry Street in Springfield. However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> street {{mainly because of the}} sound and rhythm of its name. Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 {{on the occasion of the}} book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation [...] "there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may have taken him back." [...] Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in Mulberry Street resemble Indian motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood. Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles Fordis C. Parker, who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.|$|E

Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson's {{arrival in}} the House of Commons {{attracted}} considerable press comment, much of it related to her bright red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing. She informed MPs: [...] "I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world—I know I do not look like it, but I do". The Woman's Leader [...] described her as a [...] "vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician". As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson achieved {{one of her first}} parliamentary victories in 1925, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill. She combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches, in March 1926, to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's ODNB biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while [...] "women's issues" [...] were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> former.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the ending, the team {{intended}} {{for it to be}} open to interpretation. Straley has stated that it's [...] "not your typical ending, but it’s still a nice resolution". Both he and Druckmann stated their frustration when players told them they wanted a choice at the game's ending; Straley said that most of these players told him they would <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> same ending as the game anyway. Early in the game's development, the team envisioned an ending in which Ellie was forced to kill someone in order to save the incapacitated Joel; this ending was scrapped, as the team felt that it was not conforming to the character arcs. While the game's focus testers hated the ending, suggesting alternative methods, Druckmann continued with it; when the game's music and gameplay became closer to completion, the focus testers began appreciating the ending more. When discussing the ending, VentureBeat writer Dean Takahashi referenced the quote [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire", from Schindler's List (1993), highlighting its inaccuracy: [...] "You save a life and doom the whole world," [...] he wrote.|$|E
