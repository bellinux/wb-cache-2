50|$|During {{this time}} period, Europeans made {{remarkable}} inroads in maritime innovations. These innovations {{enabled them to}} expand overseas and set up colonies, most notably during {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries.

Starting in 1670, the entire world was measured using essentially modern latitude instruments and the best available clocks. In 1730 the sextant was invented and navigators rapidly replaced their astrolabes.|$|R
