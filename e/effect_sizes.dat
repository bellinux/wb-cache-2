5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
40|$|It is {{regarded}} as best practice for psychologists to report <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> when disseminating quantitative research findings. Reporting of <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> in the psychological literature is patchy – though this may be changing – and when reported {{it is far from}} clear that appropriate <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> is more robust and versatile than standardized <b>effect</b> <b>size.</b> Guidelines for deciding what <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: i) a preference for simple <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> over standardized <b>effect</b> <b>size,</b> and ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers...|$|R

25|$|The <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> of very-low-dose doxepin in the {{treatment}} of insomnia range from small to medium. These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Conversely, very-low-dose doxepin shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure. This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset. A positive dose–response relationship on sleep measures was observed for doses of doxepin between 1 and 6mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this dose range in both young and older adults. However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration. A dose of doxepin as low as 1mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep. This, along with greater <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6mg doses of doxepin for insomnia and not the 1mg dose.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy, as {{measured}} with the PCL-R in institutional settings, shows in meta-analyses small to moderate <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> with institutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent crime with similar effects {{for the three}} outcomes. Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength {{to that of the}} PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted {{to be used as a}} general theory of crime.|$|E
