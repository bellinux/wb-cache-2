40|$|The Persian {{fallow deer}} (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica)</b> {{formerly}} {{widespread in the}} Middle East was described scientifically {{at the end of}} the 19 th century and considered extinct ever since. In 1956 it was rediscovered in south-western Iran. As a result, several countries have undertaken actions to reintroduce this subspecies in its native territory. In 2007 the Christian Oswald Foundation, in close cooperation with Iranian institutions, launched plans of in situ and ex situ breeding actions, with its centre in the German Von Opel Zoo and with cooperative Mediterranean partner coun-tries as Israel, to support conservation efforts under scientific control. We performed genetic studies to study the suspected hybridization with European fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>dama)</b> and a commitment to preserve pureblood populations.

This thesis reviews the ethological literature on four main prey species found in southwest Asia faunal assemblages during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene: gazelle (Gazella sp.), Fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> wild goat (Capra ibex) and wild sheep (Ovis sp.). This ethological review is used to develop models which predict the age and sex composition of archaeological faunal assemblages that were produced during different seasons and by different hunting techniques.

2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica),</b> wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|R
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{epidemics}} recur in Israel almost every year. Wild even-toed ungulates are seldom affected during these epidemics. The sero-prevalence of FMD in wild ungulates during 2000 and 2005 - 13 was estimated using anti non-structural proteins (NSP) ELISA. Overall, 209 samples were tested, comprising sera of 120 wild boar (Sus scrofa lybicus), 64 mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella gazella), six water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), and 19 Persian fallow deer (<b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>mesopotamica).</b> None of the tested animals presented clinical signs of FMD during blood collection. Sixteen samples (7. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI 95 %) = 4. 4 - 12. 1 %)) {{were found to}} be sero-positive. Fifteen out of 120 samples (12. 5 %) from wild boar were sero-positive, compared with only one out of 89 samples (1. 1 %) from all other species combined (Fisher's Exact test: p= 0. 003). Most of the positive samples obtained from wild boar (13 / 15 (86. 7 %)) were collected during 2007 and analysis was restricted to that year and species only. The sero-prevalence of FMD in this species during 2007 was estimated at 54. 2 % (CI 95 %= 32. 8 - 74. 5 %; n= 24). A significant infection cluster, comprising nine sero-positive samples collected in three different locations, was identified in the north-eastern part of Israel. These findings indicate that wild boar were affected during the 2007 FMD epidemic, even though wild boar presenting FMD typical clinical signs were not observed during that year. The actual role of wild boar in the spread of FMD virus in this epidemic, however, could not be determined. The negligible sero-prevalence of FMD found for all other surveillance years indicates that ongoing circulation of FMD among wildlife in Israel is unlikely. It is concluded that while the role of wildlife species in the dynamics of FMD in Israel is usually limited, there might be occasions in which wildlife play a part in the spread of the virus...|$|R

More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, and {{at least two or three}} species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).Reptiles and amphibians: Al-shouf cedar reserve is home to a rich variety of reptiles, 26 species were documented with two species endemic to Lebanon and the chouf area in particular. The reserve is also home to four species of amphibians, almost the same number of species found in the whole of Lebanon. The species include: Palestinian viper (Vipera palaestinae), Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), Mediterranean chameleon (Chamaeleon chamaeleon), European copper skink (Ablepharus kitaibelii), common toad (Bufo bufo), European green toad (Bufo viridis), Arouss Al Ayn (Salamandra infraimmaculata), Middle East tree frog (Hyla savignyi).|$|R

40|$|The fossil {{assemblage}} {{from the}} Camino Cave, {{corresponding to the}} late MIS 5, constitutes a key record to understand the faunal composition of Central Iberia during the last Interglacial. Moreover, the largest Iberian fallow deer fossil population was recovered here. Other ungulate species present at this assemblage include red deer, roe deer, aurochs, chamois, wild boar, horse and steppe rhinoceros; carnivores and Neanderthals are also present. The origin of the accumulation has been interpreted as a hyena den. Abundant fallow deer skeletal elements allowed to statistically compare the Camino Cave fossils with other Pleistocene and Holocene European populations. The morphological comparison of the dentition and morphometrical analyses of the metapodials suggest that the fallow deer from the Camino Cave are closer to the subspecies <b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> geiselana and <b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> tiberina than to the recent <b>Dama</b> <b>dama</b> <b>dama.</b> Estimations of the age at death in several fallow deer young individuals provided information on seasonality, suggesting that the cave was occupied by the hyenas almost all year round.
