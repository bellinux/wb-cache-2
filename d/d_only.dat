25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{consonant}} clusters can occur in Crow. All consonants except for /h/ can be geminated. Voiced labials and dentals (phonemic m and n, allophones b, m, w and d, n, l) are resistant to clustering. Because they only occur intervocallically, l and w do not occur in clusters. The plosive allophones b and <b>d</b> <b>only</b> occur in clusters as the second consonant and only at morpheme boundaries. The nasal allophones m and n can only occur with each other {{with the exception of}} nm, or occur with h at a morpheme boundary. Clusters in general occur at morphemic boundaries.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the massive}} land size of the 48 states of the {{continental}} United States, and the match locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from Los Angeles or San Francisco {{all the way to}} Detroit and back again, covering 2,300mi (3,680km) and 3 time zones one way. The teams in Groups C and <b>D</b> <b>only</b> played in Foxborough (Boston), Chicago and Dallas – a trip from Boston to Dallas is 2,000 miles (3,200km), but only covers one time zone; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still 1,000 miles away from both Dallas and Boston. The teams in Groups E and F's travel was a bit easier – they played exclusively in East Rutherford, New Jersey (New York City), Washington and Orlando. A few teams such as Cameroon and Italy did not have to travel great distances to cities to play matches.|$|E
25|$|Collapsible Boat A {{reached the}} deck {{the right way}} up and was being {{attached}} to the falls by Murdoch and Moody when it was washed off Titanic at 2:15a.m. In the chaos, the canvas sides were not pulled up and the boat drifted away from the ship partially submerged and dangerously overloaded. Many of the occupants climbed in from the water but many (at least seven or eight, including the first class passenger Thomson Beattie, the third class passengers Arthur Keefe, Edvard Lindell and Gerda Lindell, {{and a couple of}} firemen) died of hypothermia or fell back into the sea. By the time the survivors were transferred into Collapsible Boat <b>D,</b> <b>only</b> about 12 or 13 people were left alive, Rhoda Abbott, who had lost her two young sons in the water, being the only female. Three bodies, including that of Mr. Beattie, were left in Collapsible A, which was allowed to drift off; they were not recovered until a month later, by , another White Star Line ship.|$|E

Group A only played at the Olimpico and in Puebla (except for the Bulgaria-Italy opening tournament match, which was played in the Azteca), Group B only played at the Azteca and in Toluca (hosts Mexico were part of this group; they played all their group stage matches at the Azteca), Group C played in León and Irapuato, Group <b>D</b> <b>only</b> played in Guadalajara (including the Guadalajara area town of Zapopan; the last match of this group was played in Monterrey), Group E exclusively played in Querétaro and Nezahualcóyotl, and Group F played in the northern city of Monterrey (including the Monterrey area town of San Nicolas de los Garza; the last match of this group was played in Guadalajara).

500|$|... « Allemande I & II »: Aue {{describes}} his service {{as an officer}} {{in one of the}} Einsatzgruppen extermination squads operating in Ukraine, as well as later in the Caucasus (a major theme is the racial classification, and thus fate, of the region's Mountain Jews). Aue's group is attached to the 6th Army in Ukraine, where he witnesses the Lviv pogroms and participates in the enormous massacre at Babi Yar. He describes in detail the killing of Soviet Jews, Communists, alleged partisans and other victims of the [...] "special operations". Although he seems to become increasingly indifferent to the atrocities he is witnessing and sometimes taking part in, he begins to experience daily bouts of vomiting and suffers a mental breakdown. After taking sick leave, he is transferred to Otto Ohlendorf's Einsatzgruppe <b>D</b> <b>only</b> to encounter much hostility from his new SS colleagues, who openly spread rumours of his homosexuality. Aue is then charged with the assignment of proving to the Wehrmacht that the Mountain Jews were historically Jewish rather than later converts to Judaism. After he fails in this task, due to political pressure from the beleaguered Army, his disappointed commanding officer arranged that he be transferred to the doomed German forces at Stalingrad in late 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Bridge trains {{ran over}} the north side (Sixth Avenue) from 1988 to 2001; at this time, the skip-stop pattern was eliminated, and the D became a {{full-time}} local service, while the Q ran express during the day. The 2001 shifting of trains back to the south side (Broadway) led to the <b>D</b> <b>only</b> running north of Midtown Manhattan; the Brighton express portion of the Q became the diamond <Q>. When {{both sides of the}} bridge were finally reopened in 2004, the <Q> became an extension of the B rather than of the D; the B was already running only during the day, and s [...] this change allowed the Q to remain a full-time local service. This Brighton-Broadway combination was made permanent, rather than a return to the pre-1986 patterns where most Brighton Line trains ran along Nassau Street or Sixth Avenue, because Brighton Line residents preferred Broadway service, and West End Line residents from Chinatowns in Brooklyn wanted full-time access to Grand Street, on the Sixth Avenue Line in the Manhattan Chinatown. The restored Brooklyn B service was moved to the Brighton Line instead of returning to the West End Line on which it had run since 1967, except for periods of construction rerouting, in order to avoid running two separate shortened services (the B and D) outside weekday hours. The plan was for the B to run only on weekdays on its Bronx segment, while the restored service on the Brighton Line (formerly the D) was to run only on weekdays on its Brooklyn segment. Thus, moving the B to the Brighton Line meant it would only need to be operated on weekdays, while the D could now provide 24-hour service to both the Concourse Line in the Bronx and the West End Line in Brooklyn. This eliminated the need to run late-night and/or weekend shuttles on either the Concourse Line or the West End Line.|$|E
