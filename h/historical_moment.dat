5|$|Final Symphony is an {{official}} concert tour featuring music from Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X. The world premiere took place May 11, 2013 in Wuppertal, Germany {{where it was}} performed twice by the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra at the venue Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal. A performance by the London Symphony Orchestra took place May 30, 2013 in London at the Barbican Centre. It marked the first live performance of video game music by the London Symphony Orchestra, making a <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> for the Final Fantasy franchise and video game music in general. At Final Symphony in Wuppertal and London, Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu were in attendance. At the performances by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, both composers talked about their work on the series on stage of the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan concert venue. Final Symphony Tokyo was the first video game music concert ever to be greeted with standing ovations in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the lone}} 2013 International Origin game, England thrashed their opponents by 20 points. At {{the end of}} the year, the 2013 World Cup was held in England and Wales. England, who were now known as the 'Wall of White', {{featured}} a new record of three brothers in their squad: Sam and twins George and Tom Burgess. England played their first game against Australia in Cardiff. England got off to a surprising early lead for many when they were up 10–0 after 20 minutes. England, however, went on to lose in what was one of their best displays against the Kangaroos in years, losing 20–28. They then went on to thrash Ireland to nil in front of a record crowd in Huddersfield, in a game which saw Ryan Hall become the new England top try-scorer after a hat-trick took him to tally 17 total tries for his country. England also beat a determined Fiji in front a sold-out crowd at the KC Stadium to advance to the quarter-finals. They took on European rivals France in Wigan and after trailing 6–0 early, England went on to advance to the semi-finals to meet defending World Champions New Zealand at Wembley. It was a see-saw affair which saw England leading 18–14 with one minute on the clock remaining until New Zealand play-maker Shaun Johnson produced a <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> to level the scores and then convert his try after the siren to win the match and make the Kiwis advance to a third consecutive World Cup Final. This was the first time England or Great Britain had lost to New Zealand in England since 2005.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley {{described}} Midas as a [...] "short mythological comic {{drama in}} verse". Her efforts {{to publish it}} as a children's drama suggest that she {{thought of it as}} children's literature. At this time, [...] "instructional" [...] literature for children was most often written by women, who were viewed as having superior knowledge regarding the raising of the young. While placing women in a traditional maternal role, this literature also allowed them the opportunity to participate in the public sphere as authors and directors of morality. Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, had written two such works, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and Original Stories from Real Life (1788) that she undoubtedly knew. As Purinton writes, [...] "Mary Shelley's seemingly simple plays are complicated by their position with this context of 'instructional' literature at a <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> when the boundaries of private and public discourse are blurred." ...|$|E

Lipnick has not actually entered the military but declares himself ready to fight the [...] "little yellow bastards". Originally, this <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> just after the United States entered World War II was to {{have a significant impact on}} the Hotel Earle. As the Coens explained: [...] "e were thinking of a hotel where the lodgers were old people, the insane, the physically handicapped, because all the others had left for the war. The further the script was developed, the more this theme got left behind, but it had led us, in the beginning, to settle on that period." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Fourier, a Utopian Socialist and French philosopher, is {{credited}} with having coined the word [...] "féminisme" [...] in 1837. The words [...] "féminisme" [...] ("feminism") and [...] "féminist" [...] ("feminist") first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872, Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910, and the Oxford English Dictionary lists 1852 as {{the year of the}} first appearance of [...] "feminist" [...] and 1895 for [...] "feminism". Depending on the <b>historical</b> <b>moment,</b> culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. [...] Those historians use the label [...] "protofeminist" [...] to describe earlier movements.|$|E

500|$|The {{competition}} between 50 Cent and West, {{when the two}} released their studio albums on the same day, was penultimate {{in a series of}} articles that lists fifty key events in the history of R and hip-hop music, written by Rosie Swash of The Guardian. Swash wrote that it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] Similarly, according to DJBooth, while Graduation is far from being West's best studio album, it nevertheless is a pretty good piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> in hip-hop culture: [...] "Graduation isn’t Kanye's best, it's very few people's favorite, but it’s still an okay body of work. He’s literally transitioning into stardom right before our very eyes and attempting to embody that moment in time. Kanye's victory over 50 is the bookmark for when rap changed, it was no longer ran by the gangsters, the doors opened for Drake, Kid Cudi and J. Cole. Graduation is a monument, a hip-hop treasure, a Kanye classic." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{generated}} huge {{controversy in}} Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as [...] "profane". According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of [...] "defaming the larger-than-life reputation {{of a historical}} figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world". The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: [...] "The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> and ignorance of its consequences... It has served the enemies of Latin America, who care only that they can now denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us." [...] Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{credited}} West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, [...] "establishing a {{style of}} introspective yet glossy rap [...] ", and called him [...] "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful {{things to say about}} college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up." [...] West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a <b>historical</b> <b>moment</b> in hip-hop, because it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing. In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a [...] "new art-pop era" [...] in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.|$|E

In the first instance, we may think of something like a historical progression, of newer media remediating older ones and in particular of digital media remediating their predecessors. But ours is a genealogy of affiliations, not a linear history, and in this genealogy, older media can also remediate newer ones. (p. 55) ...|$|E
