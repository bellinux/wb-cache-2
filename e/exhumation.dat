5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the <b>exhumation</b> of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the <b>exhumation</b> and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the First World War, the British Army remained {{responsible for the}} <b>exhumation</b> of remains. The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man <b>exhumation</b> units. Between the Armistice and September 1921, the <b>exhumation</b> units reburied 204,695 bodies. After 1921, no further comprehensive search for bodies was undertaken, and in February 1921 responsibility for the cemeteries {{was transferred to the}} Commission. Nevertheless, despite the rigour of the searches, bodies continued to be discovered in large numbers. In the three years {{following the}} conclusion of the general search 38,000bodies were discovered. In the mid 1920s, 20 to 30bodies were being discovered weekly.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exhumation</b> of Yagan's head {{eventually}} proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating {{six feet}} {{down the side}} of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the <b>exhumation</b> was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E
50|$|Seventy-four Chinese burials were {{registered}} in Croydon between 1889 and 1951, {{although there are}} possibly around 130 graves. On at least four occasions <b>exhumations</b> occurred. Two bodies were exhumed in 1907, one in 1909, nine in 1913 and one in 1915. These <b>exhumations</b> reflect the spiritual importance for the Chinese to return permanently to their ancestral homeland, but given this, the number of <b>exhumations</b> seems small.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze the <b>exhumations</b> of mass graves of the Spanish Civil War (1936 – 39) and {{dictatorship}} (1939 – 75) as spaces where processes of attribution of meaning take place, and I’ll propose a provisional thesis on how {{cultural and political}} meaning is formed through the performance of forensic <b>exhumations</b> of mass graves. Hereby {{the focus is on}} the attribution of meaning to the <b>exhumations</b> in the public sphere, or, to say it with the words of Johannes Fabian, I consider death ‘a prime datum of communication’ (Fabian 2004). I argue that not only forensic truth is the object of the <b>exhumations,</b> but also the ‘making of’ truth, as a process of public acknowledgement and identification with the dead...|$|R

The use of visual media to capture social action in the surroundings of the <b>exhumations</b> serves as both a recording and as a triggering device for this emerging social memory. In {{the first part of this}} article we shall reflect on the different forms of visual and audiovisual interventions by different social actors that shape around mass grave <b>exhumations.</b> In the second part we will focus on the visual methods used by social scientists, particularly the recording of video-testimony of survivors and witnesses...|$|R
5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the <b>exhumation</b> illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's <b>exhumation</b> and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E

50|$|Undertaking <b>exhumations</b> is {{a lengthy}} and complex {{process that can}} last {{anywhere}} from several months to several years. ADIVIMA works to facilitate and coordinate this process {{so as to make}} it as simple as possible for {{the families of the victims}}. This process involves identifying sites of clandestine mass graves, gathering testimony from eyewitness survivors, planning traditional Mayan ceremonies before the <b>exhumations,</b> coordinating the efforts of the forensic anthropologists at the FAFG to exhume the graves, creating a petition from information from the forensic anthropologists, presenting the cases before the Public Ministry, and coordinating proper funerals and burial ceremonies with families of the victims.This long process is important in the documentation of the events that occurred during the internal conflict as well as to allow the families of the victims to bury the deceased in legal cemeteries. ADIVIMA has worked on more than 250 investigations and denunciations of clandestine cemeteries in Baja Verapaz and more than 25 in Alta Verapaz. ADIVIMA has provided legal accompaniment in 59 of the <b>exhumations</b> executed in Baja Verapaz and 6 in Alta Verapaz. In 2006 alone, ADIVIMA provided accompaniment and support in more than 14 <b>exhumations</b> of clandestine graves.|$|R

Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon <b>exhumation</b> in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper {{provides an overview}} of three different phases of <b>exhumations</b> that have taken place in Rwanda following the 1994 genocide. Drawing upon qualitative data resulting from interviews with 24 survivors from Kibuye, as well as meetings with Rwandan government officials, aid workers and other relevant experts, the paper argues that previous efforts to exhume and rebury the anonymous victims of the genocide with respect have failed to adequately address the harms affecting survivors. In particular, survivors desire new <b>exhumations</b> that prioritize locating and providing definitive identifications of the victims, after which point the remains should be returned to survivors to rebury in the manner of their choosing. This {{discussion paper}} represents an important first step toward bringing <b>exhumations</b> into conversation with transitional justice discourses and advances an ongoing conversation regarding the state of social reconstruction in post-genocide Rwanda...|$|R

Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed out that a licence for <b>exhumation</b> {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E
