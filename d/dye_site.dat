40|$|Different {{sizes of}} core-functionalized metallodendritic wedges were {{prepared}} by anchoring sensor-active arylplatinum(ii) sites at {{the focal point}} of Fréchet-type polyether dendritic wedges of various generations. The strong color of these metallodendrimers in the presence of SO 2 was used to assess the permeability of nanofiltration membranes (molecular weight cut-off of 400 dalton) at ambient pressure. A primary result of these studies is that dendrimers {{do not have to be}} exceptionally large for successful retention. Hence, nanofiltration, membrane-capped, immersion vials were developed, which operate as sensor devices when loaded with metallodendrimers with good retention properties. Appropriate substitution of the <b>dye</b> <b>site</b> at {{the focal point of}} these metallodendritic wedges by a catalytically active group afforded dendritic catalysts that exhibit essentially the same physical properties (shape, retention) as the corresponding dye-functionalized dendritic wedges. When this homogeneous catalyst is compartmentalized in membrane-capped vials, a unique and convenient method for its retrieval from product solutions is available. Moreover, such immobilized metallodendritic catalysts can be regenerated and stored for months without losing their activity; this provides access for the development of novel sustainable homogeneous catalysts...|$|E

Polypropylene nanocomposites have attracted a considerable interest due to its most widely used and fastest growing classes of thermoplastic polymer with low cost and low density.

However, the size of aggregates in the sample with 2 wt % nanoclay and 4 wt % PP-g-MA (PP 24 I) was larger.

In {{order to}} improve the {{cationic}} dyeing performance of para-aramid fiber, the optimal conditions of fiber pretreatment were determined through the orthogonal test with three-factor (sulfuric acid dosage, temperature and time) and four-level array using the tensile strength and apparent color depth of modified fabrics as the main evaluation criteria.

The {{results of this study}} concluded that the cotton fabrics treated with chitosan had better depth of shade than those of the untreated fabrics dyed with Mangosteen Rind.

The cotton fabrics treated with chitosan not only provided better depth of shade but also provided better wash fastness and light fastness than those of the untreated fabrics when dyed with Mangosteen Rind. The use of different mordants and mordanting methods affected the dye shade and depth of shade differently on the dyed fabrics both with and without chitosan.

30|$|Dyeing {{of fabric}} blends such as Cotton/Nylon (C/N) is {{presently}} dyed by two-bath or one-bath two-step dyeing. Good solidity of hue and depth is more critical in 50 : 50 blends and in union fabrics, such as nylon warp stretch fabrics, containing cotton or nylon/cotton wefts for swim wear and narrow fabrics, crimped nylon warp/viscose filament dress wear, or cotton warp/nylon weft constructions for uniforms, rain wear or work wear. Cotton/nylon {{is also used}} in socks. Nylon being a polyamide contains many amide groups in its structure. It also contains free amine groups {{at the ends of}} its polymeric chains, although the number of these free amine groups is less than the number of carboxylic groups, and the fiber possesses a negative charge unless in the appropriate pH region (Haji et al. 2014). These amine groups provide excellent electrostatic and hydrogen bonding sites and are the main factors contributing to the substantively of the dye molecules. Acid dyes have very little affinity for cotton, but cationic cotton can be dyed readily with acid dyes. The ammonium groups act as <b>dye</b> <b>sites</b> (Run-ling 2010).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} retinal lesions {{in children}} with severe falciparum malaria. METHODS: Color photography and fluorescein angiography were performed in consecutive children admitted to a pediatric high-dependency unit in Kenya during 1 malaria season. The presence and category of retinal lesion was compared with disease severity, clinical outcome, anemia, lactic acidosis, and parasite count. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with cerebral malaria and 14 patients who were prostrate were studied. Thirty-one of the patients had clinical features of ocular disease, including round, flame-shaped, and white-centered hemorrhages; peripheral and foveal retinal opacification; peripheral vascular occlusion; venous dilation; disc edema with hyperemia; and arterial pulsatility. Of 8 patients with retinal opacification, only 2 showed small, infrequent zones of capillary nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography; the leakage of <b>dye</b> at <b>sites</b> of opacification was not seen.

A variety of cave locations with dripping or pooled water were monitored for up to five years following dye injection. Transit times to the cave varied from less than six hours to as much as 4. 8 years.

40|$|Virtually all {{measurements}} of biochemical kinetics have been derived from macroscopic measurements. Single-molecule methods can reveal the kinetic behavior of individual molecular complexes {{and thus have}} the potential to determine heterogeneous behaviors. Here we have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine the kinetics of binding of SNARE (soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complexes to complexin and to a peptide derived from the central SNARE binding region of complexin. A Markov model was developed to account for the presence of unlabeled competitor in such measurements. We find that complexin associates rapidly with SNARE complexes anchored in lipid bilayers with a rate constant of 7. 0 × 106 M− 1 s− 1 and dissociates slowly with a rate constant of 0. 3 s− 1. The complexin peptide associates with SNARE complexes at a rate slower than that of full-length complexin (1. 2 × 106 M− 1 s− 1), and dissociates much more rapidly (rate constant > 67 s− 1). Comparison of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements made using several <b>dye</b> attachment <b>sites</b> illustrates that <b>dye</b> labeling of complexin can modify its rate of unbinding from SNAREs.

Our aim was to characterize the level of heterogeneity of bis-ANS binding sites in a thermally stressed monoclonal antibody (IgG) formulation by steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and to obtain apparent dissociation constants (K(d)) by data fitting. Because the methods differ in their underlying measurement principles, they provide different information on binding properties of bis-ANS to thermally stressed IgG. We found very heterogeneous bis-ANS binding sites on thermally stressed IgG, with apparent K(d) values ranging from as low as 50 nM (time-resolved fluorescence) to 63 μM (ITC). Steady-state fluorescence and ITC gave insight into an overall binding affinity of a wide population of <b>dye</b> binding <b>sites</b> with micromolar K(d) values. Time-resolved fluorescence was particularly sensitive to high-affinity binding sites with nanomolar K(d) s.

Electrical activity was evoked through electrical microstimulation in acute human brain slices containing the LA, signals were recorded as local field potentials combined with fast optical imaging of voltage-sensitive <b>dye</b> fluorescence. <b>Sites</b> of stimulation and recording were systematically varied.

A preferential directional spread of evoked electrical signals was observed from ventral to dorsal, rostral to caudal and medial to lateral regions in the LA. No differences in spread of evoked activity were observed between spontaneously and non-spontaneously active LA slices, i. e. basic properties of evoked synaptic responses were similar in the two functional types of LA slices, including input-output relationship, and paired-pulse depression.
