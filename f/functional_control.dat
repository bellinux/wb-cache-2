5|$|Area {{commands}} {{were the}} major operational and administrative formations of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) between 1940 and 1954. Established {{in response to}} the outbreak of World WarII, they underpinned the Air Force's geographically based command-and-control system {{for the duration of the}} conflict and into the early years of the Cold War, until being superseded by a <b>functional</b> <b>control</b> system made up of Home, Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E
5|$|The area {{commands}} {{and their}} responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands {{to begin with}} in 1940–41: Southern Area, Central Area, Western Area, and Northern Area. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to <b>functional</b> <b>control</b> occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two groups that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central Area itself was disbanded {{and most of its}} units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed No.2 (Training) Group. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War; Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, Northern Command, was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.|$|E
25|$|In March 1918, Russian {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk {{and in doing}} so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire {{territory}} gained during the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the <b>functional</b> <b>control</b> of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasians collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasus states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenia Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dynamic knee valgus and {{internal}} femoral rotation are proposed to be contributory {{risk factors for}} patellofemoral pain and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Multimodal interventions including hip abductor strengthening or <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> programmes {{have a positive impact}} of pain, however their effect on knee kinematics and muscle strength is less clear. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of isolated hip abductor strengthening and a <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> exercise on knee kinematics and hip abductor strength.  Methods: This prospective, randomised, repeated measures design included 29 asymptomatic volunteers presenting with increase knee valgus and femoral internal rotation. Participants completed either isolated hip abductor strengthening or a <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> exercise for 5 weeks. Knee kinematics were measured using inertial sensors during 2 functional activities and hip abductor strength measured using a load cell during isometric hip abduction. Results: There were no significant differences in dynamic knee valgus {{and internal}} rotation following the isolated hip abductor or <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> intervention, and no significant differences between the groups for knee angles. Despite this, the actual magnitude of reduction in valgus was 10 ° and 5 ° for the <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> group and strengthening group respectively. The actual magnitude of reduction in internal rotation was 9 ° and 18 ° for the <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> group and strengthening group respectively. Therefore there was a tendency towards clinically significant improvements in knee kinematics in both exercise groups. A statistically significant improvement in hip abductor strength was evident for the <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> group (27 % increase; p = 0. 008) and strengthening group (35 % increase; p = 0. 009) with no significant difference between the groups being identified (p = 0. 475). Conclusions: Isolated hip strengthening and <b>functional</b> motor <b>control</b> exercises resulted in non-statistically significant changes in knee kinematics, however there was a clear trend towards clinically meaningful reductions in valgus and internal rotation. Both groups demonstrated similar significant gains in hip abductor strength suggesting either approach could be used to strengthen the hip abductors...|$|R

From operating Air Defence systems to fitting missiles, they are involved in all activities of an air base and give support to various technical and non-technical jobs. The airmen of Technical trades are responsible for maintenance, repair and prepare for use the propulsion system of aircraft and other airborne weapon delivery system, Radar, Voice/Data transmission and reception equipment, latest airborne weapon delivery systems, all types of light, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic systems of airborne missiles, aero engines, aircraft fuelling equipment and heavy duty mechanical vehicles, cranes and loading equipment etc. [...] The competent and qualified Airmen from Technical trades also participate in flying as Flight Engineers, Flight Signallers and Flight Gunners. The recruitment of personnel below officer rank is conducted through All India Selection Tests and Recruitment Rallies. All India Selection Tests are conducted among 15 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct <b>functional</b> <b>control</b> of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands. Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, on the basis of their performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman. Some MWOs and WOs are granted honorary commission in the last year of their service as an honorary Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant before retiring from the service.|$|E
