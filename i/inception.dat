40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine <b>inceptions</b> and discontinuations of {{antidepressants}} {{in general}} practice. DESIGN: An observational study analysing data from an ongoing cross sectional postal survey. Every three months {{a representative sample}} of 250 doctors recorded prescribing activity for four weeks. This provided 4000 general practitioner weeks of recording per year. SETTING: A representative panel of general practitioners in England, Wales, and Scotland. SUBJECTS: Patients who began a new course of an antidepressant or had their treatment stopped or changed by the general practitioner between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of patients prescribed a new course of antidepressant; numbers discontinuing treatment; the ratio of antidepressant discontinuations to antidepressant inceptions; reasons for discontinuation; proportion of switches to another antidepressant. RESULTS: There were 13, 619 <b>inceptions</b> and 3934 discontinuations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants during the study. The number of newly prescribed courses of antidepressants increased by 116 %, mostly due to an increase in prescribing of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The ratio of total discontinuations to <b>inceptions</b> was significantly lower for serotonin reuptake inhibitors (22 %) than for tricyclic antidepressants (33 %). Differences persisted when controlled for age and sex of patients and severity of depression. However, there was more switching away from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors when they failed (72 %) than from tricyclic antidepressants (58 %). CONCLUSIONS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less likely than tricyclic antidepressants to be discontinued. A prospective study is needed in general practice to assess the implications of differences in discontinuation rates and switches on clinical and economic outcomes...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Our {{theoretical}} model proposes that insomnia, worry, and negative affect are important determinants of paranoid thinking. Anxiety produces anticipation of threat, depression increases {{the sense of}} vulnerability, worry leads to implausible ideas, and insomnia exacerbates negative affect and creates an altered perceptual state. The study objective was to examine {{for the first time}} these factors as predictors of the onset of new paranoid thinking and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. METHOD: A total of 2, 382 participants in the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were followed-up 18  months after their first assessment. Baseline assessments were used to predict the development and persistence of paranoid thinking at follow-up. Data were weighted to be representative of the general household population. RESULTS: Insomnia, worry, anxiety, depression and depressive ideas were each substantial predictors both of new <b>inceptions</b> of paranoia and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. Worry and insomnia were the strongest predictors. For example, insomnia at the first assessment led to a more than threefold increase in later <b>inceptions</b> of paranoid thinking. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that insomnia, worry, anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for new <b>inceptions</b> of paranoid thinking. The results also corroborate an emerging literature indicating that anxiety, worry and depression may encourage the persistence of paranoid thinking. The study provides the first longitudinal evidence linking insomnia and paranoia. The important clinical implication is that the use of interventions for common mental health difficulties in people with psychosis may have the additional benefit of reducing paranoia...|$|R
