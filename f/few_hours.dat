40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} whether {{use of equipment}} (technological assistance) to cope with disability was associated with use of <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> of help from another per-son (personal assistance). Methods. In a cross-sectional study of 2368 community dwellers older than 65 years with 1 or more limitations in basic {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) from the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey, the relation between technological assistance and personal assistance was examined. Results. Among people with ADL limitations, multivariate models showed a strong and consistent relation between technological assistance and personal assistance, whereby use of equipment was associated with <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> of help. Conclusions. Among people with disability, use of assistive technology was associated with use of <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> of personal assistance. (Am J Public Health. 2003; 93 : 330 – 337...|$|R

40|$|This article helps {{integrate}} {{research on}} work hours and work–family issues by examining how work–family conflict {{is related to}} the desire for more and <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> of work. Using the first wave of the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that work-to-family conflict is associ-ated with a desire for <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> of work. Family-to-work conflict, however, is only weakly associated with desired work hour changes, and we find some evidence that it makes women want {{to increase the number of}} hours they work. We also find evidence of moderating effects: Work-to-family conflict is more likely to make women want <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> when they have preschool children. We conclude that many working parents see work hour reductions as a way to cope with work–family conflict but that people prefer different coping strate-gies depending on their gender and family situation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the financial and}} time pressures associated with spouses' working lives {{play a role in}} the relation between work and divorce during the first years of marriage. Using retrospective data from the Netherlands, the results show that divorce is more likely when the husband works on average <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> and the wife more hours during the first years of marriage. Furthermore, couples facing more financial problems and those spending less time together have a higher divorce risk. The findings partly support the hypothesis that greater financial strains are responsible for the higher divorce risk when husbands work <b>fewer</b> <b>hours.</b> About 15 % of the higher divorce risk of husbands working <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> is explained by the resulting greater financial strains. No support is found for the hypothesis that the higher divorce risk of women who work more hours is due to a decrease in marital interaction time...|$|R
40|$|This study seeks {{explanations}} for working time preferences, using cross-sectional multinomial logits for the 2001 / 2002 Wage Indicator dataset (N= 21, 727). As expected, the preferences are predominately influenced by working hours’ characteristics, showing that employees with long hours prefer to work shorter hours and that short-hours workers prefer longer hours. New is {{the finding that}} salaried employees indeed want to reduce hours whereas hourly paid employees prefer to work longer hours. In contrast to public opinion, female employees show a better fit between preferred and contractual hours compared to male employees. Particularly male employees whose children have left home prefer working <b>fewer</b> <b>hours.</b> The study further shows that wage rates have a large impact on working time preferences, the lowest earnings category preferring far more often longer hours. Regarding job characteristics, employees in a challenging job less often prefer <b>fewer</b> <b>hours.</b> The employees reporting conflicts at the workplace and insufficient staffing more often prefer <b>fewer</b> <b>hours.</b> ...|$|R

While Abby approached the border of Guatemala and Mexico, it had weakened further to a tropical depression. Abby dissipated while situated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on July 16.

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E

Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams.
