40|$|Grandmothers provide {{far more}} {{childcare}} assistance than do grandfathers. This gender gap in <b>grandparenting</b> is well-documented, but not well-understood. The present study investigated whether, {{and to what}} extent, this gap was explained by a <b>grandparent</b> couple’s division of labor into market and domestic work. We analyzed panel data from two waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, comprising respondents from 11 countries. Linear regression models yielded three main findings. First, the trade-off between childcare and market work within <b>grandparent</b> couples was relatively weak, operating roughly on a one-for-eight basis. Second, transitions to retirement substantially reduced the gender gap in grandparenting: if a single-earning grandfather retired, his share of a couple’s total <b>grandparenting</b> hours {{increased by more than}} 30 percent. Third, controlling for couples’ division of market work, the gender gap in <b>grandparenting</b> was smallest in the egalitarian north and largest in the traditional south of Europe, corresponding to a geographical gradient in the societal framing of gender roles. The results direct attention to the employment-family nexus in later life and highlight the importance of understanding <b>grandparenting</b> as a life course phenomenon, performed by the <b>grandparent</b> couple as a unit of interacting providers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} health of 42 <b>grandparent,</b> 44 spouse, and 130 adult-child {{caregivers}} with 1, 669 noncaregivers in 1994 and 1974. In 1994, all three caregiver groups had poorer mental health than the noncaregivers; <b>grandparent</b> caregivers also had poorer physical health and greater activity limitations. Spouse and adult-child caregivers had not differed from the noncaregivers 20 years prior, but <b>grandparent</b> caregivers had experienced poorer health than the noncaregivers and more stressful life events than the other caregivers. Caregiving appears to add new burdens to otherwise normal lives for spouse and adult-child caregivers, while being yet another aspect of a difficult life course for <b>grandparent</b> caregivers...|$|R

5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish <b>grandparents</b> would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish <b>grandparents</b> (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, {{especially}} its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish <b>grandparents</b> were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish <b>grandparents</b> would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
