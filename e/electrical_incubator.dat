50|$|The {{original}} {{architecture of}} the college consisted of one very large building, College Hall, which was approximately 150 m in length and five stories in height. The architect was Hammatt Billings. From its completion in 1875 until its destruction by fire in 1914, it was both an academic building and residential building. On March 17, 1914, College Hall was destroyed by fire, the precise cause of which was never officially established. The fire was first noticed by students {{who lived on the}} fourth floor near the zoology laboratory. It has been suggested that an electrical or chemical accident in this laboratory—specifically, an <b>electrical</b> <b>incubator</b> used in the breeding of beetles—triggered the fire.|$|E

Four models of bird eggs incubators were highlighted using three different phases of incubation technologies. Model one, a still-air, oil lamp incubator is developed to incubate considerable few numbers of eggs, while model two, a semi-electric forced-air, oil lamp incubator demonstrated an incubator’s efficiency when an inherent hot-spot is diffused within the incubator box {{by means of}} a low-speed fan. This ensures that more eggs can be hatched, provided temperature and humidity are closely monitored. The third model, a semi-automatic, <b>electrical</b> <b>incubator</b> using an analogue thermostat with an improvised humidifier is constructed, eliminating constant human monitoring inherent in the previous models of incubators. The final model, an embedded computer based incubator was developed with negligible human monitoring with higher hatching capacity. Results from different models testing show that with an embedded computer-based model of incubator preset at temperature of 37 ◦ Celsius, humidity level of 60 - 75 %, and proper egg turning interval, embryos ’ casualty level will be reduced and increased hatchability rate will be achieved, if eggs fertility rate is high. This will eventually increase the commercial production of chickens for local consumption and commercial demands in tropical country like Nigeria.
