50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Society's first year of business, 104 policies had been written for a total coverage of $129,016. Expenses for the first year of Society business equaled $300.69 including salaries and rent. Detailed accounts were kept, noting charges of $1.33 for a pewter <b>ink</b> <b>stand</b> and $.50 for 50 quills.|$|E
5000|$|A 1938 {{issue of}} The Bankers Monthly {{describes}} the concept: [...] "The pen also gives a better write than the ordinary counter pen. The <b>ink</b> <b>stand</b> cannot be stolen, {{for it is}} fastened to the counter or desk. Besides, a chain between pen and stand prevents anyone from wandering away with the pen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephens' {{invention}} is acclaimed as {{superior to}} others. A long letter published in Mechanics' Magazine, Register, Journal and Gazette dated 2 July 1836 about <b>ink</b> and <b>ink</b> <b>stands</b> contained the following paragraph: ...|$|R

50|$|This type {{of message}} board uses {{a small number of}} {{low-power}} LEDs for illumination. Fluorescent Ink Menu Boards typically have a black background that allows the fluorescent <b>ink</b> to <b>stand</b> out with little illumination. These factors together result in a small power requirement even compared to LED Marquee style message boards.|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} of an antique vase in the Naples museum. The author's {{theory is that}} it is an <b>ink</b> <b>stand.</b> Title vignettes engraved by Francesco La Marra. Title printed in red and black; title vignettes; head and tail pieces; decorative initials. Mode of access: Internet. Bound in vellum; embossed stamp on front and rear boards; gilt label on spine; marbled edges; bookplate with monogrammed initials on front pastedown...|$|E
60|$|Peeping {{in through}} the doorway Harvey {{observed}} that the municipal dust-bin had been pierced with holes to accommodate the muzzles of imaginary cannon, and now represented the principal fortified position in Manchester; John Stuart Mill had been dipped in red <b>ink,</b> and apparently <b>stood</b> for Marshal Saxe.|$|R
500|$|Elsewhere, {{the books}} remain [...] "dusty but tidy" [...] in the {{abandoned}} school, {{and the church}} still contains its pulpit, [...] "dumb and hung with ragged red tassles" [...] with prayer books [...] "left to be trampled upon by heathen sheep and nibbled by rabbits and rats." [...] In the former post office, forms and licence applications {{and a bottle of}} dried <b>ink</b> still <b>stand</b> on the counter, while in a back room stands [...] "a nice dresser, upon which [...] a teapot and a jug and some sheet music: 'Red Sails in the Sunset', 'The General's Fast Asleep' and 'You Can't Do That There 'Ere.' Nobody on Stroma will ever sing those songs now." ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} result of using light cyan and light magenta inks is {{the removal of}} a distinct and harsh halftoning dot appearance that appears in prints that use light shades of cyan or magenta on the pure CMYK ink configuration. Usually when printing a dark color the printer will saturate the area with colored ink dots, but will use fewer ink dots to create {{the effect of a}} light color. The result is hard to notice with yellow because yellow is perceived as a very light color. However, the individual cyan and magenta <b>ink</b> dots will <b>stand</b> out in a sparse pattern due to their darker color against a white background; the result is undesirable when it is noticed.|$|R
5000|$|Inside {{some of the}} houses, Bathurst writes, {{everyday}} objects {{still remain}} where they were left decades ago; [...] "the bed and the limed matchboard ceiling are intact, untouched even by the damp. The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out {{from the top of}} the mantelpiece." [...] In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas, [...] "was a rank of family photographs, shades in Victorian dress staring out forever into a room now desolate and holed, but which had once held the life of a warm family."Elsewhere, the books remain [...] "dusty but tidy" [...] in the abandoned school, and the church still contains its pulpit, [...] "dumb and hung with ragged red tassles" [...] with prayer books [...] "left to be trampled upon by heathen sheep and nibbled by rabbits and rats." [...] In the former post office, forms and licence applications and a bottle of dried <b>ink</b> still <b>stand</b> on the counter, while in a back room stands [...] "a nice dresser, upon which stands a teapot and a jug and some sheet music: 'Red Sails in the Sunset', 'The General's Fast Asleep' and 'You Can't Do That There 'Ere.'

Also, {{observe that}} before we trouble {{ourselves}} about differences of color, {{we must be}} able to lay on one color properly, in whatever gradations of depth and whatever shapes we want. We will try, therefore, first to lay on tints or patches of gray, of whatever depth we want, with a pointed instrument. Take any finely pointed steel pen (one of Gillott's lithographic crowquills is best), and a piece of quite smooth, but not shining, note-paper, cream laid, and get some <b>ink</b> that has <b>stood</b> already some time in the inkstand, so as to be quite black, and as thick as it can be without clogging the pen. Take a rule, and draw four straight lines, so as to inclose a square, or nearly a square, about as large as a, Fig. 1. I say nearly a square, because it does not in the least matter whether it is quite square or not, the object being merely to get a space inclosed by straight lines.|$|R
40|$|One {{object of}} documenting {{languages}} {{is to make}} their data available not only to oneself, but to speakers and nonspeakers who have no direct access {{because they are in}} different places or in later epochs of time. The enabling event in collecting data is the capture in written form, by native speakers or linguists, of a suitable quantity of utterances in the language whose meaning is approximated by translation into a world language. Getting this material together is an inherently messy process, however much we idealize crisp audio recordings and well transcribed and annotated text files, with or without an analysis. No matter how astute the language consultant or how gifted the linguist, initial transcriptions are inevitably sprinkled with skips, mishearings, on-the-spot editing, slips of the pen or the keyboard, initial stabs at translation that miss the point, interference of discourse patterns between spoken and written media â€“ even when the recording is fresh and the language consultant is doing the work. This is the reason many linguists find it makes their final archivable reporting more accurate to go through a phase of making notes on paper, going back and reconsidering everything, reannotating it until they and their consultants are collectively satisfied that they've got it. And those records can be a source of insight to later scholars if they are in a form that can be preserved. Recently I had occasion to revisit data collected in field work decades ago, before practical archiving standards for language were worked out and more stable media came on the scene. The paper phase, especially the mundane realities that go along with paper, <b>ink,</b> and storage, <b>stood</b> out as a necessary prerequisite to being able to do anything at all with the data. In an isolated field situation, it was necessary to develop a disciplined approach to the handling of manuscript materials. Even in the so-called electronic age, we do well not to play down the handwritten parts of the process...|$|R
