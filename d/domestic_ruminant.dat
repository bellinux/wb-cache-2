40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, a {{scientific}} opinion was prepared by EFSA‘s Animal Health and Welfare Panel to determine the magnitude, distribution, impact and significance of infection and disease in domestic ruminants and humans, risk factors for the maintenance (in <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> populations) and spillover (from these populations to humans) of Coxiella burnetii (the causative agent of Q fever), and control options in <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> populations. A range of approaches were used, including an assessment of monitoring/surveillance data, {{the development of a}} simple conceptual model, a critical review of available literature, and several country case studies. Control options for C. burnetii infection in small ruminants were qualitatively assessed. Infection is endemic in domestic ruminants in most, if not all, EU member states, however, disease is rare and impact is limited. In the EU, Q fever is a zoonotic disease with limited public health impact, except under certain epidemiological circumstances and for particular risk groups. Human cases are often associated with proximity to small ruminants (particularly at parturition or during abortions) and dry, windy weather. Currently, there is no clear evidence of an association between bacterial genotypes/isolates and virulence. A number of longer-term options to control C. burnetii infection i...|$|E

The main goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the prevalence of nymphal stages of L. serrata in <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> in Hamedan province, western Iran. The mesenteric and mediastinal lymph node of 1080 animals were taken randomly from different slaughterhouses of Hamedan province. All lymph nodes were examined for nymphal stage of L. serrata using parasitological methods (digestion technique). The nymph of L. serrata was found in 31. 4 % (69 / 220) of goats, 15 % (60 / 400) of sheep, and 7. 4 % (34 / 460) of cattle (P= 0. 457). The infection rate in beef cattle, dairy cattle and native cattle was 1. 3 %, 6. 4 % and 12. 6 %, respectively (P= 0. 981). No evidence of correlation between gender, age groups, and L. serrata infection rate in sheep and cattle (P> 0. 05).

A dataset on voluntary feed intake, digestibility and composition of basal diets and supplements of the respective <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> species was compiled by pooling data from previously published studies. A total of 45 studies were found to meet the required criteria. Data were analysed by mixed model regression methodology. Discrete(domestic ruminant species) and continuous predictor variables (chemical composition of diet) were treated as fixed effects, while different studies were considered as random effects. Significant linear relationships were observed between log-transformed bodyweight and log-transformed dry matter intake (DMI) for all ruminant species (P< 0. 05). Within species, this scaling factor was lower for sheep and goats than for cattle and buffalo. Crude protein (CP) concentration affected DMI of ruminants positively with variations among the species; buffaloes were more responsive to CP, followed by sheep, goats and cattle. In contrast, acid detergent fibre (ADF) negatively influenced DMI across all species except buffaloes, and had a much stronger effect on DMI of sheep and cattle than on DMI of goats. The impact of CP on DM digestibility (DMD) was similar to its influence on DMI. The strongest effect was observed in cattle and was only significant in cattle and buffaloes (P< 0. 05). Neutral detergent fibre reduced DMD only in cattle, while sheep were positively influenced and goats tended to be positively affected.

This paper will review different results from in vivo and in vitro feeding approaches describing a programmed sequence in circulating insulin concentrations. The stimulatory effect of insulin and IGF 1 on follicle growth has been previously demonstrated, especially on small follicle growth prior to superovulation. Thus, in vivo feeding strategies have been recently tested to enhance embryo development.

Current classification system assumes that the host species in which a PV was firstly detected, is the original host, and the identified types are therefore named after it.

Our results deepen the knowledge on circulation of BPV types in Italy and further contribute to a better understanding on their intra-genus variability. Besides observing that BPVs can contribute to the spread of other epitheliotropic viruses, we confirmed the host-jumping ability of the Delta PVs.

We tested the affinity of different conjugates for immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from these species, performed checkerboard tests to determine the optimal dilutions of samples and conjugates, and established cut-off values using two different methods: a Receiver Operational Curve on a panel of known samples for elk, and an alternate method involving a panel of unknown serum samples for the three species. Results: We found that the anti-bovine conjugate included in the IDEXX ELISA kit has limited affinity for elk, bison, and caribou IgG. Protein G showed good affinity for IgG of all three species, while anti-deer conjugate also bound elk and caribou IgG.

In Chile, information about Map isolation from both <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> and wildlife species has been accumulating, {{but it has}} to be extended to other species. The present study focuses specifically on one wild grazing species, the pudu (Pudu puda), one of the less known South American deer considered an endangered species that shares pastures with cattle in southern Chile, where the greatest part of the country's dairy cattle population is located. Convenient samples from 3 pudus were collected from one dairy farm where Map infection had previously been confirmed in cattle. All three pudus shed the bacterium in feces and the isolates are the same type of Map as described for cattle. This study represents the first case report of Map isolation in the pudu captured from the wild. It is also the first documented association between a Map-infected dairy herd and free-ranging wildlife species, such as pudu in the Los Ríos region, Chile. Since interspecies transmission of Map and other pathogens from livestock to pudu has already been demonstrated, the results from this study suggest that this free-ranging wildlife specie, inhabiting a dairy district in southern Chile, might represent another case of spillover host...|$|E

Bluetongue Virus, the causative agent, has a worldwide distribution {{and a large number}} of antigenically different serotypes (at least 26), with vector-borne transmission.

Expansion of the virus to Northern Europe changed the epidemiology of the disease and highlighted the existence of hitherto unknown vectors and susceptible hosts. A possible epidemiological role of wildlife as hosts of the virus must be considered, complicating the control strategies. In this review, facts regarding the disease in Europe and its impact in wildlife are presented; concerns are also discussed regarding implication of wild ruminants in surveillance of the disease and formulation of novel control strategies. Further, preliminary results of a study into the presence of Bluetongue Virus in cervids in Greece, performed during the outbreak currently (2014 - 15) prevailing in the country, have indicated (by using molecular techniques) presence of the virus in 3 of 19 samples from roe deer in areas adjoining <b>domestic</b> <b>ruminant</b> farms.
