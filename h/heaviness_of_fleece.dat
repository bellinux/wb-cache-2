40|$|INTRODUCTION: Smoking behaviors, {{including}} <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> {{smoking and}} smoking cessation, {{are known to}} be under a degree of genetic influence. The enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is of relevance in studies of smoking behavior and smoking cessation due to its presence in dopaminergic brain regions. While the COMT gene is therefore one of the more promising candidate genes for smoking behavior, some inconsistencies have begun to emerge. METHODS: We explored whether the rs 4680 A (Met) allele of the COMT gene predicts increased <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking and reduced likelihood of smoking cessation in a large population-based cohort of pregnant women. We further conducted a meta-analysis of published data from community samples investigating the association of this polymorphism with <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking and smoking status. RESULTS: In our primary sample, the A (Met) allele was associated with increased <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking before pregnancy but not with the odds of continuing to smoke in pregnancy either in the first trimester or in the third trimester. Meta-analysis also indicated modest evidence of association of the A (Met) allele with increased <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking but not with persistent smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a weak association between COMT genotype and <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking, which is supported by our meta-analysis. However, {{it should be noted that}} the strength of evidence for this association was modest. Neither our primary data nor our meta-analysis support an association between COMT genotype and smoking cessation. Therefore, COMT remains a plausible candidate gene for smoking behavior phenotypes, in particular, <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> smoking...|$|R

40|$|Background Previous {{research}} has reported a significant genetic correlation between <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence (AD), but this association might {{be driven by}} the influence of AD on consumption rather than the reverse. We test the genetic overlap between AD symptoms and a <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> consumption measure among individuals {{who do not have}} AD. A high genetic correlation between these measures would suggest that a continuous measure of consumption may have a useful role in the discovery of genes contributing to dependence risk. Methods Factor analysis of five alcohol use measures was used to create a measure <b>of</b> <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> alcohol consumption. Quantitative genetic analyses of interview data from the 1989 Australian Twin Panel (n = 6257 individuals; M = 29. 9 years) assessed the genetic overlap between <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> consumption, DSM-IV AD symptoms, DSM-IV AD symptom clustering, and DSM-IV alcohol abuse. Results Genetic influences accounted for 30 %– 51 % {{of the variance in the}} alcohol measures and genetic correlations were. 90 or higher for all measures, with the correlation between consumption and dependence symptoms among nondependent individuals estimated at. 97 (95 % confidence interval:. 80 – 1. 00). Conclusions <b>Heaviness</b> <b>of</b> consumption and AD symptoms have a high degree of genetic overlap even among nondependent individuals in the general population, implying that genetic influences on dependence risk in the general population are acting to a considerable degree through <b>heaviness</b> <b>of</b> use and that quantitative measures of consumption will likely have a useful role in the identification of genes contributing to AD...|$|R
