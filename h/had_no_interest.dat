He defeated United Farmers of Alberta candidate and former speaker Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. Dawson was re-elected seven consecutive times and held his seat for twenty-eight years.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger {{to take the lead}} part. Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E

5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in {{working outside the}} film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear {{in a series of}} television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced {{at the age of}} nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{repeatedly}} refused {{to become a}} Member of Parliament, saying he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in politics. In 1742, however, the government of Sir Robert Walpole fell, and Murray's brother-in-law, the Earl of Nottingham, became First Lord of the Admiralty in the new Cabinet. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when Sir John Strange resigned as Solicitor General, Murray was made a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the CHA and one of the teams that had {{rejected}} Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in the league, Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.|$|E

5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E

5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in removing De la Rúa from power, {{because he was so}} unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E
5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E
5|$|George {{donated the}} royal library to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation.

In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became Columbia University. The province of Georgia, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.|$|E

She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson is the self-titled debut studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson. It {{was released on}} September 21, 1982, by A Records. Jackson's career as a {{recording artist}} was established by her father and manager Joseph Jackson, who arranged her recording contract with her recording company. Prior to her rise to fame, the singer <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in pursuing a musical career.

After acting in the variety show The Jacksons, she began starring in several TV series and commenced recording her debut album. Its artwork depicts Jackson in a swimming pool.|$|E

They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who {{refused to accept the}} resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht).|$|E
