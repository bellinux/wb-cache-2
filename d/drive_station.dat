5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae <b>Drive</b> <b>station.</b> This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd <b>Drive</b> <b>station</b> has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass transit}} system would pass along the Aguinaldo Highway {{and would have}} {{stations}} in Niog, Tirona Station, Imus Station, Daang Hari Station, Salitran Station, Congressional Avenue Station, and Governor's <b>Drive</b> <b>Station.</b> The project will improve passenger mobility and reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in the Cavite area by providing a higher capacity mass transit system. It also aims to spur economic development along the extension corridor.|$|E

40|$|A {{method and}} {{facilities}} for delivering payload and people into outer space are presented. This method uses, in general, engines {{located on a}} planetary surface. The installation consists of a space apparatus, power <b>drive</b> <b>stations,</b> which include a flywheel accumulator (for storage) of energy, a variable reducer, a powerful homopolar electric generator and electric rails. The <b>drive</b> <b>stations</b> accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed. The estimations and computations show the possibility of making this project a reality {{in a short period}} of time (for payloads which can tolerate high g-forces). The launch will be very cheap at a projected cost of 3 - 5 dollars per pound. The authors developed a theory of this type of the launcher. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The method, installation, and {{estimation}} {{for delivering}} payload and missiles into outer space are presented. This method uses, in general, the engines and straight or closed-loop cables disposed {{on a planet}} surface. The installation consists of a space apparatus, power <b>drive</b> <b>stations</b> located along trajectory of the apparatus, the cables connected to the apparatus and to the power stations, a system for suspending the cable, and disconnected device. The <b>drive</b> <b>stations</b> accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed. The estimations and computations show the possibility of making these projects a reality {{in a short period}} of time (see attached project: launcher for missiles and loads). The launch will be very cheap $ 1 -$ 2 per LB. We need only light strong cable, which can be made from artificial fibers, whiskers, nanotubes, which exist in industry and scientific laboratories...|$|R
25|$|Non-medical affiliations of {{the health}} system include the San Diego Padres, Club Tijuana, the UC San Diego Tritons, the San Diego State Aztecs, and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System. In 2015, UC San Diego Health spent $30 million for a 30-year naming rights deal to the Blue Line {{operated}} by San Diego Trolley, Inc. The deal changes the line's name to the UC San Diego Blue Line and grants UCSD the right to wrap three trolleys with advertising. It also changes three station names in the future: the planned Voigt <b>Drive</b> <b>station</b> near Jacobs Medical Center will be called UCSD East, the planned Pepper Canyon station will be called UCSD West, {{and the opening of}} the Mid-Coast Extension will change Old Town Transit Center to Old Town UC San Diego Health South (to denote its shuttle connection to the nearby Hillcrest hospital).|$|E
25|$|Prior to October 22, 2016, the Millennium Line shared tracks {{with the}} Expo Line from Waterfront station to Columbia station in New Westminster, then {{continued}} along its own elevated route through North Burnaby and East Vancouver, ending at VCC–Clark station, near Vancouver Community College's Broadway campus. It {{was built on}} a $1.2-billion budget and the final extension from Commercial <b>Drive</b> <b>station</b> (now Commercial–Broadway station) to VCC–Clark station was opened on January 6, 2006. From October 22, 2016 to December 1, 2016, the Millennium Line operated from VCC–Clark to Lougheed Town Centre station. Since December 2, 2016, the Millennium Line has operated between VCC–Clark station in Vancouver and Lafarge Lake–Douglas station in Coquitlam. The Millennium Line has 17 stations, three of which are transfer stations with the Expo Line (Commercial–Broadway, Production Way–University, and Lougheed Town Centre) and two which connect with the West Coast Express commuter train (Moody Centre and Coquitlam Central). The original Millennium Line's stations were designed by British Columbia's top architects and {{are very different from}} those on the Expo Line. In 2004, Busby and Associates Architects, designers of the Brentwood Town Centre station in Burnaby, were honoured for their work with a Governor General's Medal in Architecture.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1959, Electras didn't have four VentiPorts in 1981. The 1981 model saw very few changes from the 1980 restyle but it got a {{modified}} grille and new powertrains. [...] The top-line Electra Park Avenue model continued to show 4 small depressions with stickers in the chrome moulding on its front fenders until they were completely gone in 1985. Production of the rear-wheel drive Electra ceased in April 1984. Technically this was the last year of the rear wheel drive C-body, as it was renamed the D-body and would continue on under the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, and later the 1987–92 Cadillac Brougham and finally the 1993–96 Cadillac Fleetwood. The next large rear wheel drive Buick sedan would be the 1992–96 Roadmaster, sharing the same B-body as the Chevrolet Caprice and GM's last full-size rear wheel <b>drive</b> <b>station</b> wagons.|$|E
