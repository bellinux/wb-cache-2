40|$|Kinetochores bind to microtubules and are {{responsible}} for chromosome segregation and the accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division. Kinetochores are DNA-protein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA sequences. In budding yeast, the kinetochores consist of approximately fifty proteins that are organized into a large multi-subunit complex. Multiple <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> are thought {{to work together in}} establishing, sensing and maintaining the microtubule attachment. Following attachment, kinetochores act to couple microtubule force generation to chromosome movements. Microtubule associated proteins are also thought to {{play a key role in}} this process by regulating plus-end microtubule dynamics and tensile force generation. However, the actual molecular mechanism of force generation is unclear. We have used a combination of live-cell imaging, biochemical and genetic techniques in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, to identify ten kinetochore subunits and elucidate their roles in microtubule attachment. Among these proteins are microtubule binding proteins and a molecular motor with homologues in animal cells. By analyzing the changes in chromosome positioning and dynamics in various kinetochore mutants, we show that different <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> are required for the imposition of tension on paired sister kinetochores and for correct chromosome motion throughout the cell cycle. Utilizing 3 D comparative motion analysis of the chromosomes has revealed that <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> essential for microtubule attachment in early S-phase are not required at other points in the cell cycle.

40|$|The {{kinetochore}} is the macromolecular {{complex that}} assembles onto centromeric DNA and orchestrates the segregation of duplicated chromosomes. More than 60 components {{make up the}} budding yeast kinetochore, including inner kinetochore proteins that bind to centromeric chromatin and outer proteins that directly interact with microtubules. However, {{little is known about}} how these components assemble into a functional kinetochore and whether there are quality control mechanisms that monitor kinetochore integrity. We previously developed a method to isolate kinetochore particles via purification of the conserved Dsn 1 <b>kinetochore</b> <b>protein.</b> We find that the Mub 1 /Ubr 2 ubiquitin ligase complex associates with kinetochore particles through the CENP-C(Mif 2) protein. Although Mub 1 /Ubr 2 are not stable kinetochore components in vivo, they regulate the levels of the conserved outer <b>kinetochore</b> <b>protein</b> Dsn 1 via ubiquitylation. Strikingly, a deletion of Mub 1 /Ubr 2 restores the levels and viability of a mutant Dsn 1 protein, reminiscent of quality control systems that target aberrant proteins for degradation. Consistent with this, Mub 1 /Ubr 2 help to maintain viability when kinetochores are defective. Together, our data identify a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the conserved Dsn 1 <b>kinetochore</b> <b>protein.</b> We propose that Mub 1 /Ubr 2 are part of a quality control system that monitors kinetochore integrity, thus ensuring genomic stability...|$|E

40|$|Background: Kinetochores {{are large}} multi-protein {{structures}} that assemble on centromeric DNA (CEN DNA) and mediate the binding of chromosomes to microtubules. Comprising 125 base-pairs of CEN DNA and 70 or more protein components, Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores {{are among the}} best understood. In contrast, most fungal, plant and animal cells assemble kinetochores on CENs that are longer and more complex, raising the question of whether kinetochore architecture has been conserved through evolution, despite considerable divergence in CEN sequence. Results: Using computational approaches, ranging from sequence similarity searches to hidden Markov model-based modeling, we show that organisms with CENs resembling those in S. cerevisiae (point CENs) are very closely related and that all contain a set of 11 <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> not found in organisms with complex CENs. Conversely, organisms with complex CENs (regional CENs) contain proteins seemingly absent from point-CEN organisms. However, at least three quarters of known <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> are present in all fungi regardless of CEN organization. At least six of these proteins have previously unidentified human orthologs. When fungi and metazoa are compared, almost all have kinetochores constructed around Spc 105 and three conserved multi-protein linker complexes (MIND, COMA, and the NDC 80 complex). Conclusion: Our data suggest that critical structural features of kinetochores have been well conserved from yeast to man. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis reveals that human <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> are as similar in sequence to their yeast counterparts as to presumptive Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs.

In contrast, regional centromeres are complex in architecture, can be up to 5 Mb in length, and typically support many kinetochore-microtubule attachments. We used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to {{count the number of}} core structural <b>kinetochore</b> <b>protein</b> complexes at the regional centromeres in fission yeast and Candida albicans. We find that the number of CENP-A nucleosomes at these centromeres reflects the number of kinetochore-microtubule attachments instead of their length. The numbers of <b>kinetochore</b> <b>protein</b> complexes per microtubule attachment are nearly identical to the numbers in a budding yeast kinetochore.

To better understand how kinetochores attach to microtubules and how this attachment is regulated, we sought to characterize the interactions among <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins,</b> especially with respect to the microtubule-binding Dam 1 complex. The Dam 1 complex plays {{a crucial role in the}} chromosome-spindle attachment and is a key target for phospho-regulation of this attachment by the Aurora kinase Ipl 1 p. To identify protein–protein interactions involving the Dam 1 complex, and the effects of Dam 1 p phosphorylation state on these physical interactions, we conducted both a genome-wide two-hybrid screen and a series of biochemical binding assays for Dam 1 p. A two-hybrid screen of a library of 6000 yeast open reading frames identified nine <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins</b> as Dam 1 p-interacting partners. From 113 in vitro binding reactions involving all nine subunits of the Dam 1 complex and 32 <b>kinetochore</b> <b>proteins,</b> we found at least nine interactions within the Dam 1 complex and 19 potential partners for the Dam 1 complex.

Identification of Skp 1 p homologs from C. elegans, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens indicates that SKP 1 is evolutionarily highly conserved.

Simultaneously reducing both hKNL 1 and CENP-K function abolishes all aspects of kinetochore assembly downstream of centromeric chromatin and causes catastrophic chromosome segregation defects.
