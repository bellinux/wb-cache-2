Based {{on the characteristics}} of <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms, characteristics of non-fractionated <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms are laid out. Admissible non-fractionated <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms can be identi ed from atlases of geared kinematic chains by checking the redundancy condition in a kinematic equation governing the terminals.

In comparison with these measured data, the effect of tooth bearing on the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> became clear...|$|R

40|$|Now a days {{entire world}} depends upon {{automobile}}s. In an automobile motion {{is transferred from}} engine to rear wheel through various mechanical links. But <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> box plays {{a vital role in}} the automobile for transferring motion from engine to rear axle. Normally single <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> box is used for light weight vehicles but heavy load vehicles two or more rear axles with <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> boxes are used for transferring maximum amount of power from engine to rear axles. So here it is focused on the mechanical design and analysis of double axle <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> box as it transmits the power. This work develops a view to get familiar with the technologies as well as application of theories into practical work done by industries. My research contains the design with the help of CATIA/HYPER MESH and material selection of the double axle differential gearbox. For better efficiency, improvement of power transmission rate is an important phenomenon. In the present work, it is proposed to find the effect of deformation, strength variations in the Back Rear crown wheel by static analysis of <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> box of Ashok Leyland tipper (Taurus 2516 / 2 model) design on the predicted stress by using ANSYS/CATIA Software.

40|$|The {{product range}} of the rail vehicle {{industry}} comprises the construction of railroad material for long-distance and short-distance transport. This includes, for example, locomotives and cars, subway, light railway and tramway cars as well as rail vehicle equipment. The development of the industry {{is determined by the}} demand for transport services and government actions for the extension of railways and procurement of suitable vehicle types. In contrast to road vehicles, <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> are only used in a negligible percentage of rail vehicles. Primarily in the short-distance rail transport sector, the demand for <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> is growing due to increased drive power, smaller wheel diameters, lower vehicle mass with higher load capacity, the introduction of low-floor technology as well as the requirement of employing ever more quiet vehicles. In hydrostatic self-locking <b>differential</b> <b>gears,</b> oil is supplied to the <b>gears</b> within the <b>differential</b> gearbox. They only rotate relative to each other when the <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> performs a compensation movement. In this case, oil is transported in the tooth space to the meshing of the gears, where it is displaced due to the meshing and must drain through tight gaps. The pressure generated by this process acts against the compensation movement of the gear, and the drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that has the higher friction. The achievable locking torque is linearly dependent on the differential speed of the drive wheel. This locking effect is achieved without wear-prone components and works automatically without active external intervention. The design space required corresponds to that of conventional <b>differential</b> <b>gears,</b> as the locking effect is integrated in the existing design. (orig.)
