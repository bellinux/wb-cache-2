Below the flight deck is the dock and vehicle deck. The latter has the capacity to hold thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles or six Challenger 2 tanks and thirty armoured personnel carriers. The dock can hold four Landing Craft Utility MK10, each large enough to carry vehicles up to main battle tank size, which are then launched by flooding of the dock area. Four smaller LCVP MK5 that can carry thirty-five men or two light trucks are carried on davits, two each side of the ship's superstructure. Each ship also carries a fifty-two ton tracked beach recovery vehicle for assisting with landing craft recovery, as well as two tractors: one that can lay a track-way across a landing beach, and the second fitted with an <b>excavating</b> <b>bucket</b> and forks.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be <b>excavated.</b> The <b>bucket</b> is then lowered and the dragrope is then drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The bucket is then lifted by using the hoist rope. A swing operation is then performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope is then released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Overburden soils {{from open}} pit mines {{of the company}} RWE Power AG are <b>excavated</b> with <b>bucket</b> wheels and transported with band {{conveyors}} to dump heaps. The deposition of the waste soils takes place within so-called regular sections. In order to perform stability computations one needs a geotechnical characterization of the involved soils, and in particular representative values of shear strength. Undrained shear strengths from laboratory and field testing are subjected to enormous scatter which makes {{the definition of the}} representative values difficult. Therefore, a concept for a reliable determination of the undrained shear strength of waste soils in mine heaps has been introduced. It is based on a hypoplastic constitutive model for fine-grained soils which takes into account the influence of soil state (in this case represented by consistency) on the undrained shear strength. The accompanying experimental investigations include extensive laboratory testing as well as large-scale field tests suitable for a statistical evaluation. The results of numerical calculations yield an experimentally justified statistical distribution of undrained shear strengths immediately after the soil deposition. A subsequent FE analysis of the consolidation behaviour provides the time-dependent values. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{automating}} an excavation task it {{is required}} to define a nominal trajectory for {{the motion of the}} excavator tool, so that its motion can be programmed and controlled. During the motion, the <b>excavating</b> tool (the <b>bucket</b> for instance, {{in the case of a}} loader), experiences the excavating forces that must be overcome by the active forces for moving the bucket, in order for the excavation to take place. The excavating forces depend not only on the characteristics of the media to be excavated, the tool itself and the operation (combination of cutting, digging and scooping), but on the trajectory selected for the tool, as well. Moreover, the energy consumed during the excavation process is related to the forces and the trajectory. The importance of a proper trajectory becomes more evident considering that such an operation is repeated many many times. In the long run, the associated cost depends on the consumed energy and the speed at each operation. This paper is concerned with the require [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{depletion}} of fossil fuel and {{the ozone layer}} has been a global concern for decades. The International Organization for Standardization has published earth-moving machine sustainability standards for the industry to provide information to satisfy their customers' interests in their construction projects. Furthermore, steeply rising energy prices {{and the collapse of}} financial institutions in recent years have sparked demand for ways to improve individual energy efficiency. Original equipment manufacturers of earth-moving machines must address sustainability requirements, as well as remaining competitive and they aim to do this by improving machine efficiency, adopting advanced fleet management systems, providing operator training courses etc. Clearly high fuel efficiency is important to reduce {{depletion of}} fossil fuels and damage to the environment. However, the objectives of achieving the highest possible productivity (m 3 /h) and improving fuel efficiency (kg/l) are often considered separately. Many equations have been formulated to measure a machine's highest possible productivity level, yet {{there is a lack of}} consensus between academia and industry sources on the terms which should be considered within such equations. Perhaps more importantly, none have explicitly considered the relationship between fuel efficiency and productivity, and only scant consideration is given to the role of operators in achieving optimum productivity for fuel efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents an eco-approach to enable operators to achieve optimal productivity for fuel efficiency of a hydraulic excavator. Hydraulic excavators are primarily designed for <b>excavating</b> with a <b>bucket.</b> Their ease of use, versatility and high productivity have won them major segments of the construction equipment market, therefore the focus on hydraulic exactors in this paper is justifiable. The research presented in this paper has adopted an applied research methodology to collect measurable, empirical evidence through scientific experiments in order to test several hypotheses that focus on the reduction of GHG produced by construction machines.

The experimental results show that the combinations of various engine speed settings and bucket cut depths can increase productivity by 30 % and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 24 %, consequentially moving 62 % more spoil every hour for every litre of fuel consumed. The results also suggest that identifying the correct bucket cut depth is the key to significant improvements in productivity and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
