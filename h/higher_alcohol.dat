5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E

The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the associations between <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and progression of kidney damage including chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal dis-ease (ESRD) and proteinuria. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases from inception through August 2014 to identify studies investigating the association between <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and CKD, ESRD or proteinuria. Studies that reported odds ratios, relative risks or hazard ratios comparing the risk of CKD, ESRD or proteinuria in patients consuming <b>high</b> amount of <b>alcohol</b> versus {{those who did not}} consume alcohol were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Twenty studies with 292431 patients were included in our analysis to assess the associations be-tween <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and progression of kidney damage.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to investigate <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols,</b> mechanism of their formation and also factors, which have influence on formation processes. The presented thesis contains a list {{of the most significant}} <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> present in wine together with their physical and chemical properties and their effect on organoleptic wine characteristics. The main part of this thesis focuses on the origin of those <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> in wine. Thesis analyses in detail both possibilities of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> formation. First possibility is represented by catabolism of amino acids, also known as the Ehrlich s pathways. Second possibility is represented by biosynthesis of amino acids. Both mentioned processes intersect at point of the alpha keto acids. For understanding the formation of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> is essential to reveal the system of both reaction types. The issue is that those enzymatic reactions are significantly dependent on genomes encrypting the formation of individual enzymes. For the formation of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> is important, except for the genetic equipment of yeast cell strains, to supply must with nitrogen. The condition of fermentation is then influenced by forms of nitrogen, must aeration, fermentation temperature and other factor...|$|R
25|$|A quick {{estimate}} of the alcoholic strength, or proof, of the distillate (the ratio of alcohol to water) is often achieved by shaking a clear container of the distillate. Large bubbles with a short duration indicate a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content, while smaller bubbles that disappear more slowly indicate lower alcohol content.|$|E
25|$|Cabernet d'Anjou AOC The first rosé wine {{to be made}} {{entirely from}} Cabernet grapes was in 1905 {{but for most of}} the 20th century, this style of rosé took a {{backseat}} to the popularity of Rosé d'Anjou made predominantly from Grolleau. Made entirely from Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these rosés tend to be drier than Rosé d'Anjou with <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> and potentially more character.|$|E
25|$|During the Greek period, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} changed. Ripe grapes were first dried to concentrate the sugars, and these then produced a much sweeter and <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content wine {{that needed to be}} diluted with water to be drinkable. Before this, watered-down wine was disparaged, but {{by the time of the}} Talmud, wine that did not require dilution with water was considered unfit for consumption.|$|E

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} use of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> and several cellulose-derived oxygenates as blend {{components}} in gasoline. Material compatibility issues {{are expected to be}} less severe for neat <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> than for fuel-grade ethanol. Very little data exist on how blending <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> or other oxygenates with gasoline affects ASTM Standard D 4814 properties. Under the Clean Air Act, fuels used in the United States must be 'substantially similar' to fuels used in certification of cars for emission compliance. Waivers for the addition of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> at concentrations up to 3. 7 wt% oxygen have been granted. Limited emission testing on pre-Tier 1 vehicles and research engines suggests that <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> will reduce emissions of CO and organics, while NOx emissions will stay the same or increase. Most oxygenates can be used as octane improvers for standard gasoline stocks. The properties of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran, dimethylfuran, 2 -methylfuran, methyl pentanoate and ethyl pentanoate suggest that they may function well as low-concentration blends with gasoline in standard vehicles and in higher concentrations in flex fuel vehicles...|$|R

25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still {{can also be}} used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.|$|E
25|$|Upon introduction, these liquors {{were called}} aguardiente (literally fire water or fiery water). The Spanish had known {{distillation}} processes since the eighth century {{and had been}} used to drinking hard liquor. They brought a supply with them from Europe, but when this ran out, they began to look for a substitute. They had been introduced to pulque and other drinks based on the agave or agave plant, so they began experimenting {{to find a way to}} make a product with a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content.

25|$|Below is a rough {{guideline}} of {{the various}} weights of wines. Winemaker and regional style as well as oak treatment can cause a wine to be lighter or heavier in body. For example, Pinot noir can vary from being very light to more medium bodied. Another example is the influence of regional climates. Warmer climate wine regions tend to produce wines with <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> levels and thus more fuller bodied wines so that a Sauvignon blanc from California may have a heavier weight than a Sauvignon blanc from the Loire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{study the}} impact of social participation, trust, and the {{miniaturization}} of community, i. e. high social participa-tion/low trust, on the risk of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Methods: The Scania 2000 public health survey is a cross-sectional, postal ques-tionnaire study. A total of 13 604 persons aged 18 – 80 years were included. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between the social capital variables and <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption (168. 0 g/week or more for men and 108. 0 g/week or more for women). The multivariate analyses analysed the importance of confounders (age, country of origin, education, and economic stress) on the risk of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption according to the social capital variables. Results: A 14. 0 % proportion of all men and 7. 8 % of all women had an alcohol consumption above recommended levels. <b>High</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption above recommended levels {{was not associated with}} social participation but negatively associated with trust among men. The miniaturization of community cat-egory, i. e. high social participation/low trust, had significantly higher risks of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption compared to the high social capital (high social participation/high trust) category among men. Conclusion: High social participation combined with low trust, i. e. the miniaturization of community, is positively associated <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption among men. A structural/social factor which may affect the amount of alcohol consumed has thus been identified in this study...|$|R
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.|$|E
500|$|Three common {{characteristics}} of German Riesling {{are that they}} are rarely blended with other varieties and usually never exposed to oak flavour (despite some vintners fermenting in [...] "neutral" [...] oak barrels). To this last item there is an exception with some vinters in the wine regions of Palatinate (Pfalz) and Baden experimenting with new oak aging. The warmer temperatures in those regions produce heavier wines with a <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content that can better contend with the new oak. [...] While clearer in individual flavours when it is young, a German Riesling will harmonize more as it ages, particularly around ten years of age.|$|E
500|$|Riesling is {{on record}} as being planted in the Alsace region by 1477 when its quality was praised by the Duke of Lorraine. Today over a fifth of Alsace's {{vineyards}} are covered with Riesling vines, mostly in the Haut-Rhin district, with the varietal [...] being very different from neighboring German Riesling. This is partly from difference in the soil with the clay Alsatian soil being more dominately calcareous than the slate composition of Rheingau. The other differences come in wine making styles, with the Alsatian preferring more French-oriented methods that produce wines of <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content (normally around 12%) and more roundness due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks. In contrast to German wine laws, Alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized, {{a process in which}} the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s {{producers}} {{started to}} reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes. Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4–7), may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> content and dry extract) may be labelled as Chianti Superiore, although Chianti from the [...] "Classico" [...] sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as [...] "Superiore".|$|E
2500|$|While O. oeni {{is often}} the LAB most desired by winemakers to {{complete}} malolactic fermentation, the process is most often carried out {{by a variety of}} LAB species that dominate the must at different points during fermentations.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} alcohol use disorders are complex. It {{has been shown}} that ghrelin is an important signal for the control of body weight homeostasis, preferably by interacting with hypothalamic circuits, as well as for drug reward by activating the mesolimbic dopamine system. The ghrelin receptor (GHS-R 1 A) {{has been shown to be}} required for alcohol-induced reward. Additionally, ghrelin increases and GHR-R 1 A antagonists reduce moderate alcohol consumption in mice, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the GHS-R 1 A gene has been associated with <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption in humans. However, the role of central ghrelin signaling in <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption is not known. Therefore, the role of GHS-R 1 A in operant self-administration of alcohol in rats as well as for <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption in Long-Evans rats and in alcohol preferring [Alko alcohol (AA) ] rats was studied here. In the present study, the GHS-R 1 A antagonist, JMV 2959, was found to reduce the operant self-administration of alcohol in rats and to decrease <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake in Long-Evans rats as well as in AA rats. These results suggest that the ghrelin receptor signaling system, specifically GHS-R 1 A, is required for operant self-administration of <b>alcohol</b> and for <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake in rats. Therefore, the GHS-R 1 A may be a therapeutic target for treatment of addictive behaviors, such as alcohol dependence...|$|R

2500|$|Today {{water is}} used to help balance {{extremely}} ripe grapes {{that would have a}} concentration of sugars and phenolic compounds. Modern winemaking has begun to promote higher levels of ripeness and longer [...] "hang time" [...] on the vine before harvesting. This increased emphasis on ripeness has had the effect of producing wines with <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> levels (often over 15%). In many countries, such high alcohol levels qualify the wines for higher levels of duties and taxes. Adding water to grape must can dilute the wine {{to such a degree that}} the overall alcohol by volume drops below the percentage threshold for these higher taxes. The deliberate act of diluting a wine with water in order to pay lower duties and taxes is illegal in several countries.|$|E
2500|$|Pinot gris {{is grown}} {{around the globe}} with the [...] "spicy" [...] {{full-bodied}} Alsatian and lighter-bodied, more acidic Italian styles being most widely recognized.

The flavors can range from ripe tropical fruit notes of melon and mango to some botrytis-influenced flavors. In Italy, Pinot grigio grapes are often harvested early to retain the refreshing acidity and minimize some of the overt-fruitiness of the variety, creating a more neutral flavor profile. This style is often imitated in other Old World wine regions, such as Germany where the grape is known as Ruländer.|$|E
2500|$|While Californian winemakers do craft wines in more [...] "Old World" [...] or European wine styles, most Californian wines (along with Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina) favor simpler, more fruit {{dominant}} New World wines. The reliably {{warm weather}} allows many wineries to use very ripe fruit which creates a more fruit forward rather than earthy or mineralic style of wine. It also creates {{the opportunity for}} <b>higher</b> <b>alcohol</b> levels with many Californian wines having over 13.5 percent alcohol content. The style of Californian Chardonnay differs greatly from wines like Chablis with Californian winemakers frequently using malolactic fermentation and oak aging to make buttery, full bodied wines. Californian Sauvignon blancs are not as herbaceous as wines from the Loire Valley or New Zealand but do have racy acidity and fresh, floral notes. Some Sauvignon blanc are given time in oak which can dramatically change {{the profile of the}} wine. Robert Mondavi first pioneered this style as a Fume blanc which other Californian winemakers have adopted. However, that style is not strictly defined to mean an oak wine.|$|E
