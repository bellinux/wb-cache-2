The accident occurred when the aircraft struck a seawall on approach to the runway. The inquiry attributed this to crew tiredness, noting that the captain had been on duty for over 21 hours. It also criticised {{the response of the}} airport <b>fire</b> <b>unit.</b> This is the highest death toll of any aviation accident in Singapore.|$|E

My bachelor thesis concentrates on organization and activity of volunteer fire-fighter associations and voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> that exist almost in every Czech village. I specify {{the difference between}} the terms association of volunteers of fire-fighters and <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> that are established by municipality. I try to compare the competency of voluntary fire-fighters in terms of European Union. I mention the history of voluntary fire-fighters in Bohemia and Moravia in short. I specify the system of fire services in the Czech Republic and the role of voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> legislatively. Then I focus on voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> and their activity in the sphere of civil protection. My practical part specializes in voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> in the region “Vysočina” and district “Havlíčkův Brod” that are predetermined for civil protection.

50|$|The final {{aspect of}} the CB {{equation}} is having available CB <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> and appropriate munitions. Typically these are general supporting <b>fire</b> <b>units,</b> but direct supporting <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> are also used if they are available and not fully occupied by their primary role. With conventional HE shells it may require the concentrated fire of 5-10 batteries {{to deal effectively with}} one hostile battery. Hence the attraction multi-rocket launchers such as MLRS able to deliver a heavy and concentrated attack from relatively few launchers.|$|R

25|$|It {{was created}} by Oerlikon-Buehrle. The weapon was {{introduced}} in the 1960s in the Swiss Army and got updates in 1975, 1995 and 2010. They are still in use. It had replaced the system Contraves Super Fledermaus in the Swiss Air Force. The Skyguard radar system was used in the German Air Force for surveillance of low-altitude flight zones. The radar unit is readied quickly through the use of hydraulic systems for antenna erection and leveling after deployment. A typical <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> using the Skyguard consists of two twin 35mm gun platforms with a single Skyguard fire control radar.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents. They are paid a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident they respond to, on average 2 or 3 per week. Many have jobs outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary <b>Fire</b> <b>Unit</b> (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{emergency}} situations, when emergency interventions of certain {{components of the}} Emergency Response System (ERS) are necessary, occur daily in our country. <b>Fire</b> prevention <b>units</b> belong to the basic components of the ERS. After {{the transformation of the}} army system and the disestablishment {{of emergency}} corps, the number of interventions when the <b>fire</b> prevention <b>units</b> will be called up will increase. The thesis which deals with the issue qDoes the equipment of volunteer firemen comply with requirements of their mission?" examines if the equipment necessary for firemen interventions meets the needs. In the Jindřichův Hradec area there are 18 <b>fire</b> prevention <b>units</b> of categories FPU II and FPU III (FPU [...] <b>Fire</b> Prevention <b>Unit)</b> which belong to those units that cover the requirements of the area. The equipment of individual volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> and the equipment of <b>fire</b> prevention <b>units</b> is not the same. The main differencies are due to different missions of the two kinds of units (interventions in vehicle accidents, in fires, or technological interventions). All volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> are equipped with a cistern fire engine of different age which is used to transport water. The transport vehicle is used also by the <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> to transport the fire squad to the site of intervention. Besides the main equipment such as cistern containers and fire fighting trucks the <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> use auxiliary equipment. In two volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>units</b> a survey of the development of the equipment in the course of its existence is given. It reflects the development of the equipment - at first only the equipment for fire interventions was used. Nowadays, the volunteer fireunits take part in a range of emergency interventions (fires, vehicle accidents, natural disasters, calamities [...] floods, winter storms) ...|$|R
2500|$|After the Argentine capitulation, the group's 35mm Oerlikon guns, {{abandoned}} and disabled by their operators, were captured by British forces. A total of 12 GDF-002 Argentine Army and 3 GDF-002 Argentine Air Force guns were captured and later shipped back to Britain in [...] "Operation Skyguard", 5 Surviving Skyguard FC radars and the Argentine Air Forces Super Fledermaus FC radar were also shipped back to Britain. The Roland 2 <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> was also {{sent back to}} Britain as a valuable prize. The GDF-002 guns were later refurbished by BMARC and used to form a Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron at RAF Waddington. Four Skyguard radar units are employed by RAF Police to survey UK military flights over residential areas and to give warning of low-flying aircraft on sensitive facilities since 1993.|$|E

50|$|A {{technique}} called Time on Target {{was developed by}} the British Army in North Africa at the end of 1941 and early 1942 particularly for counter-battery fire and other concentrations, it proved very popular. It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise, and the need for field telephone networks in the desert. With this technique the time of flight from each <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> (battery or troop) to the target is taken from the range or firing tables, or the computer and each engaging <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> subtracts its time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire. An executive order to fire is given to all guns in the <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> at the correct moment to fire. When each <b>fire</b> <b>unit</b> fires their rounds at their individual firing time all the opening rounds will reach the target area almost simultaneously. This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires.|$|E

40|$|Involuntary {{motor unit}} {{activity}} at low rates {{is common in}} hand muscles paralysed by spinal cord injury. Our aim was to describe these patterns of motor unit behaviour in relation to motoneurone and motor unit properties. Intramuscular electromyographic activity (EMG), surface EMG and force were recorded for 30 min from thenar muscles of nine men with chronic cervical SCI. Motor <b>units</b> <b>fired</b> for sustained periods (> 10 min) at regular (coefficient of variation 0. 15, n = 14). Regularly <b>firing</b> <b>units</b> started and stopped firing independently suggesting that intrinsic motoneurone properties were important for recruitment and derecruitment. Recruitment (3. 6 Hz, SD 1. 2), maximal (10. 2 Hz, SD 2. 3, range: 7. 5 - 15. 4 Hz) and derecruitment frequencies were low (3. 3 Hz, SD 1. 6), as were firing rate increases after recruitment (similar to 20 intervals in 3 s). Once active, firing often covaried, promoting the idea that units received common inputs. Half of the regularly <b>firing</b> <b>units</b> showed a very slow decline (> 40 s) in discharge before derecruitment and had interspike intervals longer than their estimated afterhyperpolarisation potential (AHP) duration (estimated by death rate and breakpoint analyses). The other units were derecruited more abruptly and had shorter estimated AHP durations. Overall, regularly <b>firing</b> <b>units</b> had longer estimated AHP durations and were weaker than irregularly <b>firing</b> <b>units,</b> suggesting they were lower threshold <b>units.</b> Sustained <b>firing</b> of <b>units</b> at regular rates may reflect activation of persistent inward currents, visible here {{in the absence of}} voluntary drive, whereas irregularly <b>firing</b> <b>units</b> may only respond to synaptic noise...|$|R
