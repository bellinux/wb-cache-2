5|$|In February 1866, having briefly {{served at}} Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by hegumen Isaia Vicol Dioclias {{into the service}} of Golia Monastery. Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing {{interest}} in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> hide {{that he was no}} longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's adulterous affair with a Golia monk, and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.|$|E

He strove continually to keep ahead of his debts while <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> maintain the school. In February 1914, he went on a fund-raising trip to the United States, where he met John Devoy and Joseph McGarrity {{both of whom were}} impressed by his fervour and supported him in raising sufficient money to secure the continued existence of the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginnings}} of Blind Faith begin in mid-1968, with the break-up of Cream. Today {{considered to be}} the first true super group, Cream had become a financial powerhouse, selling millions of records within a few years and bringing international popularity to both the group and each individual member. Despite that success, the band was crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> mediate. In addition, Clapton had tired of playing commercially-driven blues and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre.|$|E

[...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD.

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the film for being overtly cliché, but praised Raimi's direction and Dante Spinotti's cinematography. Critic and Raimi biographer Bill Warren wrote that the film [...] "is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style and appeal of Sergio Leone's majestically operatic Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, especially the Man with No Name trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. It's brisker, more romantic and somehow more American than Leone's movies." ...|$|E

The concert was organized by Brown to help with continued relief efforts in Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News wrote that [...] "the superstar singer couldn't have been more giving, <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> please the packed house". On December 3, 2010, Brown, wearing a charcoal grey suit with Adidas sneakers, performed the song with Tyga and Kevin McCall as part of his set list at the Cali Christmas concert. In March 2011, Brown and Tyga performed [...] "Deuces" [...] on the television music show, 106 & Park. [...] "Deuces" [...] was also added to the set list of Brown's F.A.M.E. Tour. In his review of the tour, Jeremy Trucker of The Baltimore Sun criticized Brown for lip syncing his performances, and remained unconvinced that Brown's [...] "talent was special enough to warrant his continued, well, fame". In April 2012, Brown performed [...] "Deuces" [...] at the Supafest tour in Australia {{as part of a}} set list, which included [...] "Run It!", [...] "Yeah 3x", [...] "Look at Me Now", [...] "She Ain't You", [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] and [...] "Turn Up the Music", among others.

2500|$|This has led {{a number}} of {{forensic}} pathologists to support Dr. Siebert's diagnosis. Mr. Steve Meadows, the State Attorney who succeeded Mr. Ober, concluded that the criticism of Dr. Siebert was politically motivated. When the Medical Examiner Commission voted not to retain Dr. Siebert following the expiration of his contract, Mr. Meadows appointed Dr. Siebert back into the position as temporary Medical Examiner. Mr. Meadows stated: [...] "I will not sacrifice Charles Siebert {{on the altar of}} political expediency or correctness. Despite what amounts to a reckless character assassination by some media outlets and, regrettably, even some members of our government, I believe Dr. Siebert to be a competent and thorough medical examiner–not beholden to anyone or any cause. Quite simply, Dr. Siebert is a well-qualified doctor <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> serve the people of this district.

2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He's also running short of arrows.

[...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{a nucleus}} of young talent and high {{expectations}} for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet {{to the bottom of}} their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs. This was further exacerbated by negative attention over teammate Marty McSorley's hit on Donald Brashear. With his career nearing an end and the team going in the wrong direction, Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would {{have a chance to win}} the Stanley Cup. Bourque wanted to be traded to a team on the East Coast such as the Philadelphia Flyers, and Flyers' general manager Bobby Clarke offered the Bruins Andy Delmore and Daymond Langkow for Bourque. Bruins general manager Harry Sinden badly wanted Bourque to have a chance to close out his career with a Cup win and decided to pursue a trade with the Colorado Avalanche instead. <b>Doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> keep word of the deal out of the press, Sinden worked out the specifics of the deal and on March 6, 2000, Sinden told Bourque he would be traded to the Avalanche and said, [...] "this may not be your first choice, but this is the team I feel is best." [...] Bourque and fellow veteran Dave Andreychuk were sent to Colorado in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sammy Pahlsson, and a first-round draft pick (2000 draft, 27th overall, Martin Samuelsson).|$|E

2500|$|In the season's {{final game}} at Chicago, Curtis was disqualified {{early in the}} game on grounds of {{unnecessary}} roughness. Early in the game, Chicago quarterback Walter Eckersall, considered {{the best player in the}} West, dropped back for a punt from Chicago's 40-yard line, and Curtis broke through and threw Eckersall to the frozen ground as he tried to block the kick. Eckersall lay on the ground knocked out for two minutes following the blow. The referee ruled that Curtis had swung an upper cut at Eckersall's jaw and ruled Curtis out of the game. [...] A newspaper account of the incident reported that, after Eckersall had gotten the punt safely away, Curtis, who had broken through, [...] "came down on the little maroon like a whirlwind, knocking him down." [...] Without Curtis in the lineup, Michigan lost its first game since 1900, losing to Chicago by a score of 2 to 0. After the game, Yost observed, [...] "Michigan's chances were materially lessened when Curtis went out." [...] The ruling ejecting Curtis from the Chicago game became a source of controversy. Eckersall himself spoke in defense of Curtis:"I will never believe that Curtis intended to rough it with me in that unfortunate incident in the Michigan game. He was <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> block the punt, but could not stop in time to keep from running me down. I have known Curtis for several years, and he is a gentleman and one of the best sportsmen I have ever met. I feel that he has been unjustly censured for the play in which I was injured and for which he was ruled out of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed [...] "Shaheed" [...] and [...] "Swaraj", meaning [...] "martyr" [...] and [...] "self-rule" [...] respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col A. D Loganathan, and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the Indian National Army, ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in south east Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control. Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first, but became less inclined to do so {{towards the end of the}} war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the Homfreyganj massacre of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the Indian Independence League, whose leader in Port Blair, Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the Cellular Jail after <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks before}} the Present, Hook thinks that Merlin is not helping Emma at all, as Hook sees her making Dreamcatchers instead of {{sleeping}} now. But Merlin tells Hook that he is <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> help her, as he knows {{what it means to}} lose a loved one to the Dark One. Merlin tells the residents they need to acquire Excalibur from Arthur, while he takes Emma with him {{to the site of the}} Promethean Flame to acquire the spark needed to reunite Excalibur's halves. Before they go on their mission, Hook gives Emma a necklace with a ring as reminder of their love, and as a keepsake. As Emma embarks on this quest, Merlin tells her that the quest will force her to choose between the light and darkness, which could have dire consequences for the two of them. As they reached the ruins of Oxleigh, the site of the Flame, Merlin had brought the dagger with him and gives it to Emma, in order for her to summon the oldest and darkest of the Dark Ones to obtain the Spark. As Emma looked into the dagger, its display rolls back the names of the previous Dark Ones, until they saw Nimue, who appeared to them, as she was the original Dark One. Then Nimue attacks Merlin through Emma. Nimue forces Emma's hand to choke Merlin’s throat, with Nimue telling her to finish him off. Nimue urges Emma to kill Merlin, telling her that Merlin wants to destroy them and make her go back to being powerless, while Merlin counters by telling Emma to fight the darkness and to [...] "let the light win." [...] However, Emma fights it off by telling Nimue, [...] "I’m not nothing! I was never nothing! The power you have I don’t need!" [...] Then, she uses the Dagger to scroll back to her name, giving her control of Nimue, before removing the Promethean Spark from Nimue's chest. However, Nimue warns Emma that it isn't over yet, that the reforged Excalibur [...] "has more than one purpose," [...] and adds that she is still inside her head, before disappearing.|$|E
