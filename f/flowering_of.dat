50|$|Orchids {{have many}} {{associations}} with symbolic values. For example, the orchid is the City <b>Flower</b> <b>of</b> Shaoxing, China. Cattleya mossiae {{is the national}} Venezuelan flower, while Cattleya trianae is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Colombia. Vanda Miss Joaquim is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Singapore, Guarianthe skinneri is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Costa Rica and Rhyncholaelia digbyana is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Honduras. Prosthechea cochleata is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Belize, where it {{is known as the}} black orchid. Lycaste skinneri has a white variety (alba) which is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala, commonly known as Monja Blanca (White Nun). Panamas national flower is the Holy Ghost orchid (Peristeria elata), or the flor del Espiritu Santo.|$|R
5|$|According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was {{influenced}} by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas. Eventually {{this led to the}} <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> metaphysical tendencies, in contrast to the original stress on anattā in early Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith's reign is {{considered}} the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted {{until the end of}} the 8th century. The period saw the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions to the continent.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{red-headed}} myzomela {{is widely}} distributed, {{it is not}} abundant within its range. The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E

5|$|Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus; , Manouēl I Komnēnos; 28 November 1118 – 24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over {{a crucial}} {{turning point in}} the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. His reign saw the last <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a {{resurgence}} of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.|$|E
5|$|The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were {{constructed}} almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one {{time it was}} believed that this <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part of the explanation for the sudden <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The black {{honeyeaters}} {{is considered}} to be migratory rather than nomadic, with regular seasonal movements related to <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> food plants, especially the emu bush. Some movements are southwards in the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer, moving northwards again in autumn and winter. During severe droughts it has been recorded south of Bendigo and in the Hunter Region. Irruptions (sudden population increases) can occur in some areas after rain or the movement of floodwaters. Breeding has generally been recorded in the drainage basins of Cooper Creek and the Darling River in southwestern Queensland and northwestern New South Wales, {{as well as in the}} Pilbara and Gascoyne Regions in Western Australia. However favourable conditions may result in it breeding anywhere in an irruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E
5|$|James IV was 15 {{when he came}} to the throne, {{but soon}} proved a capable and {{independent}} minded ruler, whose reign is often considered to have seen a <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> Scottish culture under the influence of the European Renaissance. He took a direct interest in the administration of justice and frequently moved his court in legal circuits of justice ayres. He defeated a major Northern rebellion, mainly of supporters of the murdered James III. It began in Dunbarton in 1489, led by the Earl of Lennox and Lord Lyle and spreading through the North. James is credited with finally bringing the Lordship of the Isles under control. He forced through the forfeiture of the lands of the last lord John MacDonald in 1493, backing Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly's power in the region and launching a series of naval campaigns and sieges that resulted in the capture or exile of his rivals by 1507.|$|E
