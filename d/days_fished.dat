40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the economic rationale of input use by small trawlers in Kerala Coast. In order to estimate the production elasticities of different inputs, a Cobb- Douglas type of production function was fitted to the pooled data on coast and earnings of 50 trawlers for a period of 10 years from 1971 - 72 to 1980 - 81, obtained from Kozhikode Regional Fish Marketing Co-operative Society. For functional analysis, vessel-wise gross returns (in rupees) was taken as dependent variable and number of <b>days</b> <b>fished,</b> fuel expenditure (in rupees) and repairing and maintenance charges (in rupees) as independent variables. Marginality analysis was also done to evaluate the eflSciency of input use. The production function as well as the marginality analysis indicated that the increase in the number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> would lead to higher gross income. So also increase in oil expenditure from mean level would yield a more than proportionate increase in gross income. However, repairing and maintenance cost had a negative impact on fishing income which indicated that the vessel owner in his own interest should be cautious in the operation to avoid frequent repairs and to reduce the delay in getting the vessels repaired...|$|E

40|$|Relationships between fishing eftort, total finfish {{community}} biomass, and yield {{are determined}} using data on finfish biomass measured by research vessel trawl surveys and commercial catch and effort statistics. Combined individual species stock assessments and the Schaefer (1954) equilibrium yield model are utilized to estimate potential yields. The fishing effort of different gear types are combined {{to provide a}} standardized index of fishing effort in terms of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> as reported to the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (lCNAF). A multiplicative learning function is applied as a correction factor to reported <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> of newly developing fisheries, i. e. those deployed in areas and on stocks not previously fished. This correction factor adjusts data of fleets entering a fishery {{to the level of}} efficiency achieved by the third year in the fishery. These analyses demonstrate a six-fold increase in fishing intensity, and a 55 % decline in finfish abundance during the period 1961 - 72. Plots of yield versus standardized fishing effort indicate that fishing mortality since 1968 has exceeded that which would result in sustaining a maximum yield from the stocks under equilibrium conditions. The projected maximum sustainable yield (MSY) from Schaefer yield curves is 900, 000 tons 2, while the sum of the MSY's from individual assessment studies is 1, 300, 000 tons. It is suggested that because of species interactions summing the MSY's from individual assessments may be an overestimate of the total MSY [...] . introduction Historically, fisheries management has been stimu...|$|E

Although reporting MRF catches is a European Union legislative requirement, estimates are only available for some countries. Here, data on numbers of fishers, participation rates, <b>days</b> <b>fished,</b> expenditures, and catches of two widely targeted species were synthesized to provide European estimates of MRF {{and placed in}} the global context. Uncertainty assessment was not possible due to incomplete knowledge of error distributions; instead, a semi-quantitative bias assessment was made. There were an estimated 8. 7 million European recreational sea fishers corresponding to a participation rate of 1. 6 %. An estimated 77. 6 million days were fished, and expenditure was € 5. 9 billion annually. There were higher participation, numbers of fishers, <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> and expenditure in the Atlantic than the Mediterranean, but the Mediterranean estimates were generally less robust. Comparisons with other regions showed that European MRF participation rates and expenditure were in the mid-range, with higher participation in Oceania and the United States, higher expenditure in the United States, and lower participation and expenditure in South America and Africa. For both northern European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, Moronidae) and western Baltic cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae) stocks, MRF represented 27 % of the total removals. This study highlights the importance of MRF and the need for bespoke, regular and statistically sound data collection to underpin European fisheries management.

40|$|Abstract only. A {{key element}} in {{evaluating}} fishery management strategies is to examine their effects on the economic performance of fishery participants, yet nearly all empirical studies of fisheries focus on fishing as opposed to processing. However, the economic benefits derived from fish stocks are largely determined by the revenue generated from fish processing, which is linked to both the way fish are harvested and the products produced from the fish. In this study we econometrically estimate a (flexible) revenue function for catcher-processor vessels operating in the Alaskan pollock fishery, recognizing potential endogeneity and heterogeneous fishing inputs and conditions, to evaluate the factors underlying fishing revenue changes. In evaluating product choices we find significant own-price supply responses and product substitutability, and enhanced revenues from the increased number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> and number and duration of tows induced by regulatory changes associated with the American Fisheries Act of 1999. We also find significant growth in economic productivity, or higher revenues over time after controlling for observed productive factors and price changes, which exceeds that attributable to increased harvests...|$|E
40|$|Gulf of Mexico, white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, catch {{statistics}} {{have been collected}} by NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service for over 50 years. Recent occurrences such as natural and manmade disasters have raised awareness for the need to publish these types of data. Here we report shrimp data collected from 1984 to 2011. These 28 years of catch history are the time series used {{in the most recent}} Gulf of Mexico white shrimp stock assessment. Fishing effort for this stock has fluctuated over the period reported, ranging from 54, 675 to 162, 952 <b>days</b> <b>fished.</b> Catch averaged 55. 7 million pounds per year, increasing significantly over the times series. In addition, catch rates have been increasing in recent years, with CPUE levels ranging from 315 lb/day fished in 2002, to 1, 175 lb/ day fished in 2008. The high CPUE’s we have measured is one indication that the stock was not in decline during this time period. Consequently, we believe the decline in effort levels is due purely to economic factors. Current stock assessments are now using these baseline data to provide managers with further insights into the Gulf L. setiferus stocks...|$|E
40|$|Since 1975, the Canadian {{provinces and}} Canadian Wildlife Service have {{conducted}} surveys on freshwater recreational fishing. Completed every five years, these surveys contain human dimension (HD) indicators pertaining to motivation and satisfaction. To date, data analysis of those surveys has mostly {{been based on}} simple statistical analysis like cross-tabs and t-tests.

Exploring motivations over time revealed a steady importance of non-catch related motivations, while the weight of catch-related items declined. A principal component and cluster analysis of combined data (1990 - 2005) identified four distinct clusters, each predominantly driven by another motive (Everything, Catch, Eating, Social). An information-theoretic approach was applied to analyse satisfaction as a function of various variables. Satisfaction was positively correlated to <b>days</b> <b>fished,</b> fishing success and harvest, nature, social interactions, and year partaken and negatively correlated to residency, age and eating fish.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{addressed}} {{the problems of}} recall and nonresponse biases in self-report angling participation surveys. While each source of bias has been recognized as problematic, previous research has not {{addressed the}} interaction effects of these biases. Recall bias was assessed by comparing immediate, 3 -month, and 6 -month recall periods. A diary format {{was used for the}} immediate recall period and mail surveys for the 3 -month and 6 -month recall periods. Nonresponse bias was assessed by conducting telephone interviews with subjects who did not respond to the mail or diary surveys. The dependent variable was total number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> over two separate 3 -month periods. Analysis showed significant first-order interactions (P ^ 0. 05), suggesting that recall bias and nonresponse bias are not independent factors. Respondents are more likely to report higher levels of participation and nonrespondents lower levels of participation as the length of recall period increases. Findings indicate that studies which use long recall periods, or do not control nonresponse bias, overestimate use. Future studies can control recall and nonresponse biases by combining frequent sampling with telephone interviews that request short recall periods.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the input utilization, the techno-economic efficiency of fishing operations is commonly assessed by employing various production function models. In view of the contribution of mechanized trawlers to the total marine fish production of India, {{an attempt was made}} to assess the input-output relationship in trawler operations at three major landing centres along the Kerala coast using the model Cobb-Douglas production function. The functional relationship indicated that there was ample scope to enhance the net profit of trawlers by increasing fishing days and area of operation at Neendakara and Munambam, whereas at Cochin Fisheries Harbour, the present operation is almost at the optimum level. At Neendakara landing centre, the fishing days in a year could be increased from the average level of 193 to 204 and in Munambam from 203 to 229 days to get the maximum profit. There is also a provision for increasing oil consumption in all three landing centers to achieve optimum level of utilisation. Even though the number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> in a year is not up to the optimum in all the major centers selected for the study, the existing socio-economic conflicts and inter-sectoral disputes should be addressed while increasing the number of fishing days of mechanized trawlers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —A {{comparison}} of diary and mail methodologies for {{a cohort of}} anglers who fished Lake Ontario {{was used to examine}} biases associated with 12 -month recall from mail questionnaires. Significant differences in estimates were found between estimates reported by respondents in diaries (1992) versus mail questionnaires (1991) for number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> and fish consumption, but not for fishing expenditures and catch. After the data were adjusted for a decline in fishing on Lake Ontario between 1991 and 1992, it was found that angler-days were overestimated by 44 - 45 % on the 12 -month recall mail questionnaire. This percentage can serve as an initial estimate of a correction factor for future studies. Lower average annual fish consumption rates were reported in the diary year compared with the mail questionnaire year. However, because of the lower percentage of meals of sport-caught fish during the diary year and the knowledge that sportfishing declined in 1992 for Lake Ontario anglers, {{it is not clear what}} portion of the decline can be attributed to different factors. A rough estimate of 10 % can be obtained by assuming that con-sumption of fish that were not sport caught was the same in both years and that anglers accurately reported the overall percentage of that consumption in 1991. Less avid anglers had a very small positive discrepancy between their mail (1991) and their diary (1992) estimates of fishing partic...|$|E

Gulf of Mexico, pink shrimp, Farfantepenaeus duorarum, catch {{statistics}} {{have been collected}} by NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, or its predecessor agency, for over 50 years. Recent events, including hurricanes and oil spills within the ecosystem of the fishery, have shown that documentation of these catch data is of primary importance. Fishing effort for this stock has fluctuated over the 50 -year period analyzed, ranging from 3, 376 to 31, 900 <b>days</b> <b>fished,</b> with the most recent years on record, 2008 and 2009, exhibiting declines up to 90 % relative to the high levels recorded in the mid 1990 ’s. Our quantification of F. duorarum landings and catch rates (CPUE) indicates catch have been below the long-term average of about 12 million lb {{for all of the}} last 10 years on record. In contrast to catch and effort, catch rates have increased in recent years, with record CPUE levels measured in 2008 and 2009, of 1, 340 and 1, 144 lb per day fished, respectively. Our regression results revealed catch was dependent upon fishing effort (F= 98. 48 df= 1, 48, p< 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 67), (Catch= 1, 623, 378 + (520) × (effort)). High CPUE’s measured indicate stocks were not in decline prior to 2009, despite the decline in catch.

40|$|Variations in the {{efficiency}} of demersal trawlers operating in the English Channel were examined through the estimation of a stochastic frontier production function. The most important measurable factor affecting efficiency was {{the age of the}} vessel. However, unmeasurable factors accounted for about 65 % of the variation in efficiency, and as much as 9 % of the total variation in catches between boats. It is postulated that most of this variation was due to differences in skipper and crew skill. In contrast, “luck ” accounted for around 11 % of the variation in catches between boats. Key words: fisheries management, stochastic production frontier, technical efficiency. Input controls are a common feature of most fisheries management programs throughout the world. An assumption of input controls is that restricting input use indirectly leads to a target level of output being achieved. How-ever, input controls are restricted to inputs that are readily measurable, such as boat size, en-gine power, gear use, and <b>days</b> <b>fished.</b> When other factors affect the level of output, the use-fulness of input controls in achieving target output levels may be limited. For example, when skipper or crew skill is a major factor determining the output of the vessels, con-trolling other inputs may be largely ineffec-tive for many of the boats. Variations in skip-per and crew skill are likely to contribute to the overall technical efficiency of the ves-sel, along with other potentially uncontrolla-ble inputs. The contribution of these inputs to the production process will influence the po-tential success of management through input controls. Early attempts at examining variations i...|$|E
