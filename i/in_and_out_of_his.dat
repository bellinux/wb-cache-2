25|$|Lutenistic {{practice}} has reached considerable heights in recent years, {{thanks to a}} growing number of world-class lutenists: Rolf Lislevand, Hopkinson Smith, Paul O'Dette, Miguel Serdoura, Andreas Martin, Robert Barto, Eduardo Egüez, Edin Karamazov, Nigel North, Christopher Wilson, Luca Pianca, Ben Salfield, Yasunori Imamura, Anthony Bailes, Peter Croton, Xavier Diaz-Latorre. Singer-songwriter Sting has also played lute and archlute, <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collaborations with Edin Karamazov, and Jan Akkerman released two albums of lute music in the 1970s while he was a guitarist in the Dutch rock band Focus.

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E

25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E

500|$|With filming {{beginning}} on May 21, 2007, [...] "It's Alive!" [...] marked the permanent relocation of production from Miami to Los Angeles. Five episodes {{of the first}} season were shot on location in Miami, which Cerone said was [...] "a bigger hassle than it was worth". Showtime programming chief Robert Greenblatt said that [...] "It just became impossible, production-wise, to shoot the whole show [...] ", because of the overlap between Dexters production window and Florida's hurricane season, making property insurance costly. A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and filmed, according to producer Sara Colleton, [...] "a lot of pieces—not just Dexter walking <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use", which the writers then worked into the episode and others.

500|$|The {{title track}} {{incorporates}} a sped-up sample of Gloria Gaynor's [...] "Casanova Brown", {{with an emphasis}} on the line [...] "I was lonely and naïve" [...] from the sample. [...] "Running" [...] has Scott-Heron's spoken word vocals scattered and repeated. [...] "Ur Soul and Mine" [...] samples the vocals from Rui da Silva's house classic [...] "Touch Me", distorting the vocals in the song's verse, but retaining its refrain. The densely produced [...] "Home" [...] features clattering snares, a heavily reverbed keyboard sample, a drum loop, and a vocal sample of Scott-Heron singing the line [...] "home is where the hatred is...", taken from the song of the same name from his 1971 album Pieces of a Man. BBC Online's Ele Beattie said that Jamie xx's sampling [...] "tunes the listener <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical predecessors. He rewires a personal musical canon into something utterly contemporary". Robert Christgau characterizes Scott-Heron's original narratives as those of [...] "a drug fiend of considerable perversity and tremendous intelligence who's gonna be dead soon", and comments that Jamie xx [...] "hears in [...] last testament an irreversible disintegration that he translates into heavily sampled minimalist electro marked indelibly by Scott-Heron's weariness, arrogance, and wit." ...|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E

2500|$|In {{a time of}} {{professional}} crisis, Fassbinder made Satan's Brew (Satansbraten, 1976) a bleak amoral comedy that pays homage to Antonin Artaud's [...] theatre of cruelty. Stylistically far from the melodramas that made him known internationally, Satan's Brew {{gave way to a}} new phase in his career. In Satan's Brew, a neurotic poet suffering from writer's block struggles to make ends meet while dealing with a frustrated long suffering wife, a half witted brother and various prostitutes and masochist women who drift <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life.
