25|$|When light {{reflects}} (by <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflection)</b> at {{an angle}} from an interface between two transparent materials, the reflectivity is different for light polarized in the plane of incidence and light polarized perpendicular to it.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{interactions}} of visible and NIR radiation with the surfaces of rock and mineral samples was investigated by measuring the reflectance and the polarization properties of scattered and reflected light for slab samples of obsidian and fine-grained basalt, prepared to controlled surface roughness. It is shown that {{the degree to which}} radiation can penetrate a surface and then scatter back out, an essential criterion for mineralogic determinations based on reflectance spectra, depends not only upon the composition of the material, but also on its physical condition such as sample grain size and surface roughness. Comparison of the experimentally measured reflectance and polarization from smooth and rough slab materials with the predicted models indicates that single <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflections</b> are responsible for the largest part of the reflected intensity resulting from interactions with the surfaces of dielectric materials; multiple <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflections</b> are much less important for such surfaces...|$|R
25|$|Linear polarizers can {{be divided}} into two general categories: {{absorptive}} polarizers, where the unwanted polarization states are absorbed by the device, and beam-splitting polarizers, where the unpolarized beam is split into two beams with opposite polarization states. Polarizers which maintain the same axes of polarization with varying angles of incidence are often called Cartesian polarizers, since the polarization vectors can be described with simple Cartesian coordinates (for example, horizontal vs. vertical) independent from the orientation of the polarizer surface. When the two polarization states are relative to the direction of a surface (usually found with <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflection),</b> they are usually termed s and p. This distinction between Cartesian and s–p polarization can be negligible in many cases, but it becomes significant for achieving high contrast and with wide angular spreads of the incident light.|$|E

50|$|A lesser-known {{aspect of}} total {{internal}} reflection is that the reflected light has an angle dependent phase shift between the reflected and incident light.
