50|$|<b>Detonator</b> <b>{{crimping}}</b> pliers, cap {{crimping pliers}} or <b>detonator</b> <b>crimping</b> tool {{is a common}} tool when working with explosives. The construction {{is very similar to}} the construction of any other multi-tool or pliers. The specific feature is the presence of one groove on each of the opposing jaws. When the jaws are open, the groves will appear as a semi circle with an elliptical extension. When fully closed the two grooves will form a cylindrical shape.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear part}} of a {{detonator}} is usually made of a rigid but malleable aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of <b>detonator</b> <b>crimping</b> pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping {{the neck of the}} detonator. This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{sizes of}} Gerber tool are available, with various {{combinations}} of components from the mundane (screwdrivers) to the esoteric (demolition <b>detonator</b> <b>crimps),</b> {{and from the}} key-chain sized, like the [...] "Shortcut" [...] to hefty, 8 oz models like the [...] "Diesel".|$|R
5000|$|Another type of time pencil had a {{percussion}} cap but no detonator attached. Instead {{there was a}} crimping attachment at one end to allow pyrotechnic fuse to be crimped on. When a time pencil of this type fired, it would light the fuse which would burn towards a <b>detonator</b> <b>crimped</b> onto the other end. Because standard safety fuse burns at around half a metre per minute, it is not practicable to provide delays {{of more than a}} few minutes in this way. It was also possible to connect a pencil detonator to so-called [...] "instantaneous fuse" [...] (not to be confused with detonating cord) which had an unusually fast burn rate of over 7 metres per second.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} use of explosives uses electrical detonators or the capped fuse {{which is a}} length of safety fuse to which an ordinary <b>detonator</b> has been <b>crimped.</b> Many detonators' primary explosive is a material called ASA compound. This compound is formed from lead azide, lead styphnate and aluminium and is pressed into place above the base charge, usually TNT or tetryl in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{hydrazine}} nitrate is {{an energetic}} coordination compound having explosive properties in between that of primary and secondary. This compound {{was used to}} develop a new type of detonator by replacing the sensitive primary explosive, lead azide in conventional detonators and keeping RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) as the output secondary explosive. The detonator consists of three regions, viz., initiation, deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), and output. The initiation and the electrical rating of 1 A/ 1 W no-fire were achieved using a suitable squib. The DDT and the output were taken care of, by pressing requisite quantities of Nickel hydrazine nitrate and RDX, respectively at required densities in a stainless steel stem channel. The <b>detonator</b> assembly involves <b>crimping</b> the squib and the stem channel in a stainless steel housing and applying a suitable resin at the crimped-end for leak tightness. The output was assessed from the dent depth on aluminium plate, volume expansion on lead block, and by achieving veloctiy of detonation of 8200 m/s in mild detonating cords, containing 0. 95 g/m of RDX, which indicates full-order detonation. The detonators were tested at system level and found to perform satisfactorily...|$|R
