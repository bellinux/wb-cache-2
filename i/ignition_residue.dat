40|$|Peat {{record from}} a very small basin, the former mire of Verevainu, in the nearest {{vicinity}} of ancient Keava settlements (8 th- 11 th centuries) and hillforts (5 th– 13 th centuries), was investigated by means of palaeoecological approach, namely by pollen, charcoal, and loss-on-ignition analyses and radiocarbon dating. The study aimed at ascertaining the appearance of prehistoric man {{in the area and}} reconstructing the local vegetation history and human impact on the environment around the inhabitation centre. The first sporadic cereal pollen grains appeared in the sediments in the Late Bronze Age at ca 1500 BC. Both peat <b>ignition</b> <b>residue</b> values as indicators of topsoil erosion and pollen evidence suggest forest clearance, opening of landscape, and cultivation of cereals from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. Approximately at AD 350 – 500 the rate of human impact upon environment increased notably...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of different industrial waste, by-products or other {{materials such as}} ground granulated blast furnace slag, silica fume, fly ash, limestone, and kiln dust, etc. as supplemen- tary cementing materials has received considerable attention in recent years. A study has been conducted {{to look into the}} performance of laterite as Supplementary Cementing Materials (SCM). The study focuses on compressive strength performance of blended cement containing different percentage of laterite. The cement is replaced accordingly with percentage of 2 %, 5 %, 7 % and 10 % by weight. In addition, the effect of use of three chemically different laterites have been studied on physical performance of cement as in setting time, Le-Chatlier expansion, loss on <b>ignition,</b> insoluble <b>residue,</b> free lime and specifically compressive strength of cement cubes tested at the age of 3, 7, and 28 days. The results show that the strength of cement blended with laterite as SCM is enhanced.

30|$|Gross {{energy and}} {{proximate}} composition of Chaetomorpha sp. cultured at SCORL {{were analyzed by}} standard methods based on AOAC (2012) by Central Laboratory (Thailand) Co. Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand. Protein content was measured by Kjeldahl method on AOAC official method 981.10 using a factor of 6.25. Ash was measured after incineration at 600  °C for 2  h based on AOAC official method 942.05. Fat was extracted with ether using a Soxhlet apparatus and weighed following AOAC official method 920.39. Crude fiber {{was measured by the}} loss on <b>ignition</b> of the <b>residue</b> after digestion with 0.313  N sulfuric acid and 0.255  N sodium hydroxide based on AOAC official method 978.10. Carbohydrates were calculated by subtracting the protein, lipid and ash levels from 100  %. Gross energy was initially calculated as calories (protein, 4  kcal g− 1; fat, 9  kcal g− 1; carbohydrate, 4  kcal g− 1), and then converted to joules.|$|R
5000|$|During the inquest, Olive [...] "Dot" [...] Path {{explained}} {{the nature of}} the Chung Ling Soo's trick. The muskets Soo used in his act were brazed with extra steel barrels. After each performance, to avoid expending powder and bullets, Soo never unloaded his guns properly. Rather than firing them off or drawing the bullets with a screw-rod, as was normal practice, he removed the bullet and powder by dismantling the breeches of the guns. Over time, a residue of unburned gunpowder was able to form in the channel he had made to allow the flash to bypass the barrel and ignite a blank charge in the ramrod tube. Thus, when Soo performed the trick that night, <b>ignition</b> of the <b>residue</b> in the channel allowed the flash from the pan to also ignite the charge behind the marked bullet in the barrel of the gun being used. Consequently, the bullet that was not supposed to fire was fired in the normal way, hitting Soo in the chest. The circumstances of the accident were verified by the gun expert Robert Churchill. Soo's death was ruled [...] "accidental" [...] with a final verdict of [...] "misadventure".|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the writer}} {{discussed}} on the Neoglaciation in the Japanese Islands. One information {{is derived from}} the writer's own glacial-geologic field work in bothCentral Japanese Mountains (Hida, Kiso and Akaishi) and Hidaka Mountains; the otherinformation is based on the paleolimnological evidence in the core sample of Lake Biwa-ko. There are two groups of moraines (Moraine V and Moraine VI) which areextremelyfresh in morphology, only in the Central Japanese Mountains in which climate is warmerand wetter than Hidaka Mountains. Accordingly, the writer owed their origin mainlyto the increase of the precipitation. Regarding age of them, the writer inferred tenta-tively 1, 500 years B. P. and 500 years B. P. Basis of that inference is the paleolimno-logical data indicating wetter climate by <b>ignition</b> loss and <b>residue</b> ratio and by pollendiagram (AP: NAP) and also cooler climate by the low amount of calcium carbonate. In addition, wood found in the outwash deposits of Shirouma Kitamata gave data of 520 + 80 years B. P. Although the existence of pluvial climate in the age of several thousands years agois also shown in the diagram of Biwa-ko, advance of glaciers in that time must bereexamined since the amounts of calcium carbonate suggest considerably high temperatureduring the Hypsithermal Interval in the Japanese Islands...|$|R
30|$|The {{methods used}} for sample {{treatment}} and analysis {{were carried out}} based on the standard procedures recommended by AOAC (1990). Crude fat, ash, total carbohydrates, total nitrogen and nitrogen free extract were determined according to AOAC (1990). Oil extraction {{was carried out by}} using hexane as a solvent. Brebra seeds were ground with blender (Waring blendor) and the fine flour was mixed with hexane and the whole content was stirred by magnetic stirrer for more than 4  hr and then filtered with Whatman’s No 1 filter paper. Hexane was recovered by the help of Rota vapor (Buchi, Switzerland) (Meher et al. 2006) at 100  rpm. Total oil was quantified gravimetrically and calculated as percentage of oil. Protein (N × 6.25) was determined by the Kjeldahl method. To determine the ash content of the sample, 5 gm of the sample was incinerated in a muffle furnace. Crude fiber content of the sample was determined by mixing of the fine powder of the sample with 1.25 % sulfuric acid and 1.25 % sodium hydroxide solutions under specific conditions for <b>ignition</b> and dried <b>residue</b> remaining after digestion of the samples was considered as crude fiber (AOAC 1990). Calories were calculated by multiplying the amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat by the factors of 4, 4 and 9 (K cal) and 17, 17 and 37 (KJ), respectively, (EEC, 1990). To determine the moisture, the sample was dried to a constant weight in a vacuum oven at 100 °C (AOAC, 1990). The moisture loss was determined gravimetrically.|$|R
40|$|Typically, using a {{rotary furnace}} as a heat generator, a {{temperature}} of approximately 1450 °C and a time of 60 min is needed to produce clinker requiring large amounts of energy. Recently, a method of sintering Portland cement by microwave furnace has been developed with the aim to reduce this high consumption {{of energy in the}} conventional cement production. In this work, cement raw meal was calcined by a microwave furnace operating at 2. 45 GHz with 900 W at 1150 °C at several periods of time but was not completely successful in terms of clinker formation. Therefore, an electric furnace was used at 1300 °C and 1350 °C for 30 min to further heat the material. Chemical compositions of the formed clinker, characterized by XRD, presented C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A and C 4 AF as the main constituents confirming a clinker similar to those of clinker produced by rotary kiln or conventional technique. Loss on <b>ignition</b> and insoluble <b>residue</b> of the resultant clinker were analyzed by chemical analysis and the results were found to pass ASTM C- 114. It was found that the raw meal sintering process using a microwave furnace followed by transfer to an electric furnace could reduce not only the temperature by at least 100 °C but also the processing time of the clinker. In addition, there is no grinding cost for clinker preparation in this process. This processing of clinker would decrease energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere, a major cause of global warming...|$|R
