One important feature of this model is that detailed electrochemical characteristics of the PEM electrolyzer are fully incorporated into the thermodynamic analysis. Heat production in the PEM cell due to irreversible losses has been investigated and compared with the thermal energy demand of PEM cell. It is found that a PEM electrolyzer normally operates in an exothermic mode as the heat production due to overpotentials exceeds the thermal energy demand. As the electrical energy input dominates the overall energy input, the exergy efficiency is found {{about the same as}} the energy efficiency. Parametric analyses have been performed to investigate the effect of important design and operating parameters on the plant energy conversion efficiency.

The hybrid energy system consists of a small/mediumsized nuclear reactor (SMR), a biomass processing plant and an optional <b>hydrogen</b> <b>production</b> <b>plant.</b> The SMR operates at full power constantly {{and is able to}} switch its thermal output to supply steam for electricity generation or to supply the biomass production plant for heat processes. The hybrid energy system management is electricity load following, so the sum of the electricity generated by both the hybrid energy system and the aggregated wind farm tends to meet electricity demand. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>production</b> <b>plant</b> is considered as an electricity consumer and operates during times of wind power surplus. Wind farm capacities of 100 - 2000 MW were investigated.

The increase in SMR size is limited due to the maximum heat demand for the biomass processing plant, which is 1033 GWhth annually (expected heat for biomass processing within a radius of 80 km).

The four reactor types considered were a single bed particle suspension system, a dual bed particle suspension system, a fixed panel array, and a tracking concentrator array. The current performance of semiconductor absorbers and electrocatalysts were considered to compute reasonable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies {{for each of the four}} systems. The U. S. Department of Energy H 2 A model was employed to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen output at the plant gate at 300 psi for a 10 tonne per day production scale. All capital expenditures and operating costs for the reactors and auxiliaries (compressors, control systems, etc.) were considered. The final cost varied from $ 1. 60 –$ 10. 40 per kg H 2 with the particle bed systems having lower costs than the panel-based systems. However, safety concerns due to the cogeneration of O_ 2 and H_ 2 in a single bed system and long molecular transport lengths in the dual bed system lead to greater uncertainty in their operation. A sensitivity analysis revealed that improvement in the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the panel-based systems could substantially drive down their costs.

The pressure boundary for these tests is a water-cooled spool-piece pressure vessel designed for operation up to 5 MPa.

Lifting is accomplished with a motorized threaded drive mechanism attached to a rigid structural frame.
