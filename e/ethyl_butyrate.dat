40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} changes in aroma {{volatiles}} associated with fruit senescence based on the climacteric or non-climacteric behavior found {{in a collection of}} near-isogenic lines (NILs) of melon (Cucumis melo L.). Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methodologies. In general, senescence led to a decrease in complexity of the aroma profile, but total area Counts increased compared with harvest levels. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that induced climacteric behavior in the NILs strongly affected the aroma profile during senescence. In senescent climacteric fruit, the relative contributions of acetate and non-acetate esters to the overall aroma profile increased in relation to harvest levels, particularly propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, methyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, hexyl acetate and benzyl acetate. In the senescent non-climacteric NILs, 15 - 17 volatiles of the profile were undetectable. particularly some aldehydes, while other aldehydes Were reduced, esters did not change from harvest to senescence and sulfur-derived compounds increased. Methyl propanoate decreased with senescence irrespective of the climacteric behavior The climacteric senescent fruit of the NILs could be discriminated from the non-climacteric fruit by 11 compounds of the profile, mainly benzyl acetate, hexanal and pentanal among others (ethyl acetate, propan- 2 -yl acetate, nonanal, 2 -ethylhexan- 1 -ol, methyldisulfanyl-methane, acetone and 2 -ethylfuran). The grouping of senescent climacteric NILs was mainly attributable to high relative values of <b>ethyl</b> acetate, methyl <b>butyrate</b> and propyl acetate.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of oil and}} food components in real food products on the absorption of four flavour compounds (limonene, decanal, linalool and <b>ethyl</b> 2 -methyl <b>butyrate)</b> into linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) was studied using a large volume injection GC in vial extraction method. Model food systems and real food products investigated included oil/water emulsions, oil/casein models, oil/pectin models, skim milk and whole milk. A small amount of oil (50 g l- 1) had {{a major influence on}} the amount of flavour absorption. Because of solubilization of the more apolar flavour compounds limonene, decanal and linalool into the oily phase, only the remaining flavour compounds in the aqueous phase were available for absorption by LLDPE. After 14 days of exposure, absorption of limonene and decanal decreased by 97 °and that of linalool by 86 ÐDue to a salting out effect, absorption of the less apolar ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate (E 2 MB) first increased with increasing oil concentration, but decreased at higher oil concentrations (> 2. 5 g l- 1). Oil/casein and oil/pectin models showed that the more apolar flavour compounds were mainly dissolved in the oily phase and that the compounds present in the aqueous phase could interact with casein or pectin. Oil influenced the level of flavour absorption by LLDPE to a much greater extent than pectin or casein. However, the low amount of fat (1. 11 g l- 1) in skim milk had no influence on the absorption of flavour compounds. Only the proteins in skim milk (especially casein) decreased the absorption of limonene and decanal, because the fat was probably entrapped. Whole milk, which contained a higher concentration of (free) fat, suppressed the absorption of all flavour compounds by LLDPE to the same extent as was found for the oil model solutions. In general, absorption results from skim milk and whole milk were in good agreement with the results of the investigated model solutions containing individual food components...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 During {{the course}} of ripening, Cheddar cheese {{frequently}} develops a flavor defect described as fruity. Recent work has indicated {{that the use of}} certain starter cultures ultimately results {{in the development of the}} defect as the cheese ages. The flavor compounds responsible for the defect, however, have not been elaborated. The purpose of this investigation was to isolate and identify the components responsible for the fruity flavor defect and to evaluate the role of certain cheese starter cultures in the development of the defect. Since the fruity character of the defect is apparent in the aroma of the cheese, the compounds responsible for the defect were expected to be reasonably volatile. Volatile constituents were isolated by a distillation technique from fat expressed from a typically fruity cheese by centrifugation. The volatile constituents were then separated by gas-liquid chromatography. By monitoring the odor of the effluent stream of the column, it was possible to determine which components had fruity odors, and these were subsequently identified by mass spectral analysis and coincidence of retention time with the authentic compounds. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl octanoate were found to be the only compounds with detectable fruity odors. The volatiles from the fat of four cheeses possessing varying degrees of the defect and their matching non-fruity controls were analyzed by a gas entrainment, on-column trapping, gas-liquid chromatographic technique. The manufacturing and curing conditions of each fruity cheese and its matching control were identical, except for the use of different starter cultures. Ethanol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and ethyl hexanoate were more abundant in each of the fruity samples. The approximate concentration range of these compounds was as follows: In fruity cheese; ethanol 400 to 2, 040 ppm, <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> 1. 6 to 24 ppm, ethyl hexanoate 0. 9 to 25 ppm. In non-fruity cheese; ethanol 36 to 320 ppm, <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> 0. 7 to 4. 7 ppm, ethyl hexanoate 0. 3 to 2. 2 ppm. In ten commercial Cheddar cheeses selected at random from the market, the concentration of ethanol ranged from 5. 5 to 620 ppm. Single-strain cultures of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus diacetilactis, and Streptocococcus cremoris as well as three mixedstrain commercial cultures were evaluated for ethanol and acetaldehyde production in non-fat milk medium. Among the single-strain cultures there appeared to be no correlation between ethanol production and species, although considerable variation was noted for strains within a species. The mixed-strain cultures were designated A, B, and C. Cultures B and C had been implicated in the development of the fruity flavor defect in Cheddar cheese, while culture A produced normal cheese of good quality. Cultures B and C produced approximately 40 times more ethanol than culture A when incubated in non-fat milk medium for one month at 7 °C. Certain single-strain cultures and the three mixed-strain cultures were tested for their ability to reduce acetaldehyde and propanal, and to catalyze the formation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> when ethanol and butyric acid were provided as substrates. Acetaldehyde and propanal were reduced to the corresponding alcohols by all cultures, but the formation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> was not observed in any culture. A good correlation between high levels of ethanol and high levels of <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and ethyl hexanoate in the fruity cheeses suggests that the quantity of ethanol present in the cheese may determine the amount of ester formed. Further, starters resulting in the defect produced considerably more ethanol than cultures resulting in normal cheese when incubated at 7 °C, a normal temperature for curing Cheddar cheese. This observation adds weight to the hypothesis that certain cultures are directly responsible for the defect...|$|E

The compounds, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl valerate, isoamyl isovalerate, phenol, 2, 6 -diterbutyl- 4 -methyl-phenol, phenylacetonitrile, α-bergamotene and β-farnesene were identified {{for the first time}} in the head-space of this fruit...|$|E
