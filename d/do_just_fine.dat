Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII will <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to follow how the Swedish press covers the Swedish music {{competition}} Melodifestivalen and the Eurovision Song Contest. To do so, I have followed how the image of The Ark, a Swedish rock group, changed in the press during Melodifestivalen and the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. They won in Sweden, but in the big European finale they ended up in 18 th place. The study is based on a discourse analysis with the focus on the social dialog of the band in the newspapers. I have applied the analysis on 14 articles published the day after Melodifestivalen and a week ahead, and 14 articles published the day after the Eurovision Song Contest and a week ahead. My selection of articles has been made by using a media archive that provides over 400 daily and evening papers. The study also contained the search for metaphors and loaded terms in the articles. During my study I discovered that after Melodifestivalen the media thought highly of The Ark, and every newspaper celebrated their victory. They were convinced that the group would <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> in the big European finale. After the Eurovision Song Contest the media changed their opinion and called The Arks performance a fiasco. The study also illuminates how the press is caught in a circle of sensational and “quick” news and the importance of opinions in the press to get a various apprehension of the reality that we live in.
