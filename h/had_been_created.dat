5|$|The Epistle to Diognetus {{states that}} {{language}} {{was not a}} determining factor in Christian identity; Christians might speak any language.

5|$|When the Curule Aedileship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created,</b> it {{had only}} been opened to Patricians. Eventually, however, Plebeians won full {{admission}} to the Curule Aedileship. In addition, after the Consulship had been opened to the Plebeians, the Plebeians acquired a de facto right to hold both the Roman Dictatorship and the Roman Censorship (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> in 443 BC) since only former Consuls could hold either office. 356 BC saw the appointment of the first Plebeian Dictator, and in 339 BC the Plebeians facilitated {{the passage of a}} law (the lex Publilia), which required the election of at least one Plebeian Censor for each five-year term. In 337 BC, the first Plebeian Praetor was elected.|$|E
5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> {{in the first}} six months of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.|$|E
5|$|File {{artifacts}} and meta-data {{can be used}} to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of Microsoft Word embedded a Global Unique Identifer into files which identified the computer it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> on.

The NCDC also blocked a plan by the Department of Works to build a bridge across the lake along the land axis between Parliament House and the War Memorial contrary to Griffin's plans.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God and dread nought. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> {{without a}} set of rules or boundaries to govern the storylines.

5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} began {{to expand rapidly}} with the {{construction}} of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on Steam, and Valve announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007. By May that year, 13million accounts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> on the service, and 150 games were for sale on the platform.|$|E

5|$|Benn's father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} {{had been}} added to the system that took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took over much of the remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's {{instructions}} for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E

5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a {{biologist}} on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular {{aspect of the}} television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Garter is {{ex officio}} the officer of {{arms of the}} Order of the Garter, England's senior Order of Chivalry.
