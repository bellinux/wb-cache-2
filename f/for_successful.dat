5|$|During the 16th century, locally {{produced}} wool was {{the major}} export commodity. Plymouth was the home port <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> maritime traders, among them Sir John Hawkins, who led England's first foray into the Atlantic slave trade, as well as Sir Francis Drake, Mayor of Plymouth in 1581 and 1593. According to legend, Drake insisted on completing his game of bowls on the Hoe before engaging the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers set sail for the New World from Plymouth, establishing Plymouth Colony – the second English colony {{in what is now}} the United States of America.|$|E

Debates in design disciplines were focusing on design science, design methodology, wicked problems, Ulm methodology, new German design, and semiotic and scenario technique.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E

5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi Propaganda Ministry {{was quick}} to {{capitalise}} on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made {{for the first time}} to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made Flag Officer of U-Boats.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{is largely}} insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes spiders, crane flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While {{the consumption of}} invertebrates is necessary <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.|$|E

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime <b>for</b> <b>successful</b> regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
