500|$|The paceman was rested for {{the match}} against Derbyshire {{immediately}} after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against Warwickshire, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman’s men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford {{for the second time}} during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's benefit. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in [...] "stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler". Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollardwho later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> ballfor a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but William Roberts successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} God's promise in [...] "and, behold, I am with you, and {{will keep you}} {{wherever}} you go," [...] answered all of Jacob's requests, except that for sustenance. Jacob prayed in [...] "If God will be with me," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "Behold, I am with you." [...] Jacob prayed, [...] "And will keep me," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "And I will keep you." [...] Jacob prayed, [...] "In this way that I go," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "wherever you go." [...] Jacob prayed in [...] "So that I come back to my father's house in peace," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "and will bring you back." [...] But the Rabbis taught that God did not answer Jacob's request for sustenance. Rabbi Assi, however, taught that God answered Jacob's request for sustenance, too, for in [...] God says, [...] "for I will not forsake you," [...] and forsaking applies to sustenance, as in , [...] "Yet I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave {{three and}} a half stars out of four saying, [...] ""Return of the King" [...] is such a {{crowning}} achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed even by those who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> first two films." [...] Richard Corliss of Time named it the best film of the year. The main criticism of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was its running time, particularly the epilogue; even rave reviews for the film commented on its length. Joel Siegel of Good Morning America said in his review for the film (which he gave an 'A'): [...] "If it didn't take forty-five minutes to end, it'd be my best picture of the year. As it is, it's just one of the great achievements in film history." [...] There was also criticism regarding the Army of the Dead's appearance, rapidly ending the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{said the}} film [...] "works and it {{delivers}} just {{about what you}} expect when you buy your ticket" [...] but felt that it [...] "lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version" [...] and the [...] "plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety described it as an unnecessary remake that will appeal mostly to young adult audiences who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> original film. [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film [...] "has no patience for such subtleties" [...] as Romero's thematic concerns or suspense-building. [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film." [...] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Good zombie fun, the remake of George A. Romero's [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] is the best proof in ages that cannibalizing old material sometimes works fiendishly well." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Instead, the new [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] satirizes itself and satirizes its genre, and, on its own unambitious terms, the movie succeeds. It's silly, witty and good-natured, not scary so much as icky, and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated it [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Commercial director Zack Snyder, making a killer feature debut, trades homemade cheesiness for knowing style, revels in the sophistication of modern special effects, and stomps off with the best remake – er, ”re-envisioning” – of a horror classic in memory." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the remake streamlines the original film [...] "by discarding everything special about it in favor of pure visceral effect".|$|E
