5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E

25|$|Cactus Jack {{wrestled}} Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, {{but being}} severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot {{to sell a}} storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day {{that they were the}} brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.|$|E
25|$|At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin {{reveals the}} truth, that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had {{arranged}} their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, {{hoping that they}} would fall in love, so that Dae-su might experience the same pain which Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten {{to tell the truth}} to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for driving Woo-jin's sister to suicide and begs him not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's pleading, and tells Mr Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator, recalls the events of his sister's suicide, and shoots himself {{in the head with a}} Derringer pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter, so that they can stay together and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and embraces him. Dae-su breaks into a wide smile, which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.|$|E

500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E

500|$|In September 2005, Bon Jovi {{released}} the album <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day. The album cover contains a red smiley face which guitarist Richie Sambora stated echoes its title song.

In Sweden it charted at No.4, their best position since [...] "Sleeping in My Car." [...] Although the second single, [...] "Anyone," [...] did not chart well in Europe, [...] "Stars," [...] the third single, charted well in Scandinavian and German speaking countries. NME's review called <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day [...] "...another clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock." [...] A review of [...] "I Wish I could Fly" [...] written by Håkan Steen of Aftonbladet said, [...] "The come-back single is a disappointment.

500|$|<b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{day is a}} {{commonly}} spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers {{at the end of}} a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that [...] "Have a nice day" [...] can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is {{typically}} spoken by service employees or clerks to customers {{at the end}} of a transaction. A mercantile method of expressing [...] "thank you" [...] as in [...] "thank you for shopping with us" [...] or [...] "thank you for using our service", it is commonly used among people in the United States and by retailers in New Zealand and elsewhere. In the 1970s, the American supermarket chain Kmart opened a store in Brisbane, Australia.
