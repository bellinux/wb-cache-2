5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace {{with the help of}} his architect John Nash. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E

Boswell remarked, [...] "My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced." [...] William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated, [...] "He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing {{has a tendency to}} fill up. -Johnson is dead.- Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; -no man can be said to put you <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Johnson." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Paul {{received}} {{an offer of}} a trial with Colombian club Millonarios. Colombian clubs, who {{were not required to}} pay transfer fees as their governing body was not affiliated with FIFA, made similar offers to several British players. Paul was one of seven to make the trip to South America. Millonarios offered him a £3,000 signing on fee and £150 per month, far in excess of the £12 per week maximum wage in British football. Once in Colombia, Paul found himself unimpressed by the conditions. He remarked in his autobiography that seeing football pitches surrounded by barbed wire put him <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a concentration camp, or maybe the monkey-house in the zoo". Paul stayed in Bogota for only ten days, without playing a single match. Swansea were angered by Paul's trip, and transfer-listed him upon his return. As a result, he transferred to Manchester City for £19,500, a British record for a half-back. Ken Barnes joined the club on the same day. The two became close friends; Paul was best man at Barnes' wedding.|$|E

On the 18th, while cruising near Mobile Bay, De Soto spotted a steamer and closed {{and took the}} steamer James Battle, laden with rosin and cotton. At that point, two screw steamers from the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, [...] and , closed with some disappointment, {{as they had been}} chasing the blockade runner. Later that same evening, as De Soto and Ossipee independently chased a second steamer, Capt. Walker closed and took William Bagley before the other Union ship could do so. Those actions by De Soto, which put Capt. Jonathan P. Gillis of the Ossipee <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a voracious aquatic bird", led to a dispute over prize claims.

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "discovering what a big city could offer you and what it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

The Nazis themselves, in their SS, made use of the symbol too.

2500|$|Ellis Hanson, for instance, {{writes that}} Newman and Froude clearly [...] "presented a {{challenge}} to Victorian gender norms", but [...] "Faber's reading of Newman's sexlessness and Hurrell Froude's guilt as evidence of homosexuality" [...] seems [...] "strained". When John Campbell Shairp combines masculine and feminine imagery in his highly poetic description of Newman's preaching style at Oxford in the early 1840s, Frederick S. Roden is put <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "the late Victorian definition of a male invert, the homosexual: his (Newman's) homiletics suggest a woman's soul in a man's body". Roden, however, does not argue that Newman was homosexual, seeing him rather – particularly in his professed celibacy – as a [...] "cultural dissident" [...] or [...] "queer". Roden uses the term [...] "queer" [...] in a very general sense [...] "to include any dissonant behaviours, discourses or claimed identities" [...] in relation to Victorian norms. In this sense, [...] "Victorian Roman and Anglo-Catholicism were culturally queer". In Newman's case, Roden writes, [...] "homoaffectivity" [...] (found in heterosexuals and homosexuals alike) [...] "is contained in friendships, in relationships that are not overtly sexual".|$|E
2500|$|Summing {{up while}} {{alluding}} to the politically motivated attacks that prevented Hunt's fuller acceptance as a major literary figure in his time, Hazlitt draws a comparison with certain gentleman-poets of an earlier age, integrating this with what he has noted of Hunt's personal vanity: [...] "We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb: why should we not say that Mr. Hunt is a delightful one? ... He is the only poet or literary man we ever knew who puts us <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Sir John Suckling or Killigrew or Carew; or who united rare intellectual acquirements with outward grace and natural gentility. ... A wit and a poet, Mr. Hunt is also distinguished by fineness of tact and sterling sense: he has only been a visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue." [...] And here Hazlitt brings in {{the main reason for}} the hostile politically oriented attacks on him in Tory periodicals, his notorious criticism of the Prince Regent in his own periodical: [...] "What then is the draw-back to so many shining qualities, that has made them useless, or even hurtful to their owner? His crime is, to have been Editor of the Examiner ten years ago ...".|$|E
2500|$|In 1582, Emperor Akbar invited Hiravijaya Suri {{to explain}} him the {{principles}} of Jainism. He first discussed the various aspects of religion and philosophy with Abul Fazal and the [...] later with Akbar. The emperor {{was so impressed with}} Hiravijaya Suri that he bestowed on him the title of Jagatguru which means World Teacher or the Preceptor of the World. Akbar was so much influenced by the religion of non-violence preached by the Jain monk that he became vegetarian most of the days, prohibited slaughter of animals and birds, released prisoners and gave up fishing and hunting which were his favourite pastime. Hiravijaya is reported to have told Akbar: [...] "How could a man’s stomach be a tomb of animals?" [...] creating an aversion for meat eating <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Akbar. Out of respect for Jainism, Akbar declared firmans (royal decree) for Amari Ghosana banning the killing of animals during the Jain festivals of Paryusana and Mahavir Jayanti. He rolled back the Jazia tax from Jain pilgrim places like Palitana. Furthermore, he issued firmans for ban on slaughter of animals for six months in Gujarat, abolishing the confiscation of property of deceased persons and removal of the Sujija Tax (Jazia) and a Sulka (possibly a tax on pilgrims).|$|E

40|$|According to Eugene Nida’s {{theory of}} Dynamic Equivalence, the most {{important}} aim for translators should be to achieve equivalence in effect between original and translated text. Equivalent effect is achieved when a translated text creates the same associations and feelings <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> its readers as was produced <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the readers of the original text. Venuti argues that equivalent effect can only be achieved using what {{he refers to as}} ethnocentric domesticating strategies – placing the text in the cultural context of the target audience. He claims that a foreignizing strategy – placing the reader in the cultural context of the original text – is more appropriate. Consequently, equivalent effect is, in his view, a poor guiding principle for translation. In this thesis, I challenge Venuti’s view that only domesticating strategies can achieve equivalent effect in translation. Using a response-oriented method, I measure the associations to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) produced <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> respondents from the source audience. Then, I compare these associations with the associations produced <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> readers of two translations of AAVE – one using a domesticating strategy to translate AAVE, and one using a moderate foreignizing strategy. In contrast to Venuti’s assertions, I find that the moderate foreignizing strategy produces associations <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the target readers that are more in accordance with the associations produced <b>in</b> the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the source readers than the domesticating strategy...|$|R
