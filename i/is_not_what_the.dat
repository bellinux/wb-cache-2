500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E
500|$|Tokuma Shoten {{merged with}} Studio Ghibli in June 1997. Miyazaki's next film was {{conceived}} while on vacation at a mountain cabin {{with his family}} and five young girls who were family friends. Miyazaki realised that he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls, and set out to do so. He read shōjo manga magazines like Nakayoshi and Ribon for inspiration, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes and romance", which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> girls [...] "held dear in their hearts". He decided to produce the film about a female heroine whom they could look up to. Production of the film, titled Spirited Away, commenced in 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million). As with Princess Mononoke, the staff experimented with computer animation, but kept the technology at a level to enhance the story, not to [...] "steal the show". Spirited Away deals with symbols of human greed, and a liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The film was released on July 20, 2001; it received critical acclaim, and is considered among the greatest films of the 2000s. It won the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was also commercially successful, earning ¥30.4 billion (US$289.1 million) at the box office. It is the highest-grossing film in Japan.|$|E

500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the figures}} have darkened due to {{oxidation}} of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light.

Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.|$|E
