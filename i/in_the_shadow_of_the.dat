5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E

5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 2004, Ramirez {{missed a}} Red Sox game {{to become an}} American citizen. He entered the next game running onto the field to a {{standing}} ovation while carrying a small American flag held in his hand.

5|$|While in office, in 2001 Reed {{served as}} the {{campaign}} manager in Shirley Franklin's successful election campaign to become the 58th Mayor of Atlanta. As a campaign manager in an election occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> September 11 attacks, he surveyed potential voters' perceptions of the propriety of the campaign's advertising broadcasts. At the time certain ads were thought to focus on sensitive topics. After winning the election, Franklin chose Reed as one of two co-chairs on her transition team. In this role {{he was charged with}} identifying and reviewing candidates for cabinet-level positions.|$|E

5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E
5|$|Morell {{continued}} {{to appear in}} Hammer's horror films in the ensuing decade. He had parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cat (1960), She (1964, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel Vengeance of She (1967), the lead in The Plague of the Zombies (1965), and The Mummy's Shroud (1966). He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E

5|$|The towpath {{continues}} to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but {{from here to}} Conisbrough, {{the only way to}} see the navigation is from a boat or from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
5|$|Ivo Andrić was Yugoslavia's {{best known}} and most {{successful}} literary figure, and {{was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. He was born to Bosnian Croat parents near Travnik on 9 October 1892, but {{spent most of his}} childhood in the town of Višegrad. His formative years were spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's most distinctive landmark, the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge. As a child, Andrić played in its vicinity and heard the legends surrounding it and its patron, Mehmed-paša Sokolović. Born into a Serb family {{on the outskirts of the}} town, Sokolović had been abducted by the Ottomans as a child as part of the devşirme tax imposed on Christian subjects, taken to Istanbul and inducted into the janissary corps. Despite this, he remained in contact with his Christian family, and in 1557, convinced the Porte to grant the Serbian Orthodox Church autonomy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the exit ramp. Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
