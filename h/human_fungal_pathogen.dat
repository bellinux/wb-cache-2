Vomocytosis was first reported in 2006 by two groups, working simultaneously in the UK and the USA, based on time-lapse microscopy footage characterising the interaction between macrophages and the <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen</b> Cryptococcus neoformans. Subsequently, this process has also been seen with other fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and Candida krusei.

40|$|Summary: <b>Human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogens</b> are {{associated}} with diseases ranging from dandruff and skin colonization to invasive bloodstream infections. The major human pathogens belong to the Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus clades, and infections have high and increasing morbidity and mortality. Many <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogens</b> were originally assumed to be asexual. However, recent advances in genome sequencing, which revealed that many species have retained the genes required for the sexual machinery, have dramatically influenced {{our understanding of the}} biology of these organisms. Predictions of a rare or cryptic sexual cycle have been supported experimentally for some species. Here, I examine the evidence that human pathogens reproduce sexually. The evolution of the mating-type locus in ascomycetes (including Candida and Aspergillus species) and basidiomycetes (Malassezia and Cryptococcus) is discussed. I provide an overview of how sex is suppressed in different species and discuss the potential associations with pathogenesis...|$|R

Although calcineurin signaling is conserved among fungi, recent studies indicate important divergences in calcineurin-dependent cellular functions among different <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogens.</b> <b>Fungal</b> <b>pathogens</b> utilize the calcineurin pathway to effectively survive the host environment and cause life-threatening infections. The immunosuppressive calcineurin inhibitors (FK 506 and cyclosporine A) are active against fungi, making targeting calcineurin a promising antifungal drug development strategy.

40|$|SummaryCryptococcus is a {{globally}} distributed <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen</b> that primarily afflicts immunocompromised individuals. How and {{why this}} <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen</b> associates with plants {{and how this}} environmental niche influences its life cycle remains a mystery. We established Cryptococcus-Arabidopsis and Cryptococcus-Eucalyptus systems and discovered that Cryptococcus proliferates and mates on plant surfaces. Mating efficiency of C. gattii was markedly enhanced on plants and myo-inositol and indole acetic acid were specific plant products that stimulated mating. On Arabidopsis, dwarfing and chlorosis were observed following infection with a fungal mixture of two opposite mating-type strains, but not with either mating-type alone. This infection process is countered by the plant jasmonate-mediated defense mechanism. These findings reveal that Cryptococcus can parasitically interact with plants to complete its sexual cycle, which may impact {{an understanding of the}} origin and evolution of both plant and animal fungal pathogens in nature...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Candida glabrata is an {{emerging}} <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen</b> that is frequently drug tolerant, resulting in difficulties in treatment {{and a higher}} mortality in immunocompromised patients. The calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin plays critical roles in controlling drug tolerance, hyphal growth, and virulence in diverse fungal pathogens via distinct mechanisms involving survival in serum or growth at host temperature (37 and higher). Here, we comprehensively studied the calcineurin signaling cascade in C. glabrata and found novel and uncharacterized functions of calcineurin and its downstream target Crz 1 in governing thermotolerance, intracellular architecture, and pathogenesis in murine ocular, urinary tract, and systemic infections. This represents a second independent origin of a role for calcineurin in thermotolerant growth of a major <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen,</b> distinct from that which arose independently inCryptococcus neoformans. Calcineurin also promotes survival ofC. glabrata in serum via mechanisms distinct from C. albicans and thereby enables establishment of tissue colonization in a murine systemic infection model.

Chemical characterization of the N-glycan indicates {{that it is a}} mixture of Hex 5 - 13 HexNAc 2 oligosaccharides, the major molecular species corresponding to Hex 6 - 8 HexNAc 2.

40|$|The stress-activated mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) pathway {{is widely used}} by {{eukaryotic}} organisms as a central conduit via which cellular responses to the environment effect growth and differentiation. The basidiomycetous <b>human</b> <b>fungal</b> <b>pathogen</b> Cryptococcus neoformans uniquely uses the stress-activated Pbs 2 -Hog 1 MAPK system to govern a plethora of cellular events, including stress responses, drug sensitivity, sexual reproduction, and virulence. Here, we characterized a fungal “two-component ” system that controls these fundamental cellular functions via the Pbs 2 -Hog 1 MAPK cascade. A typical response regulator, Ssk 1, modulated all Hog 1 -dependent phenotypes by controlling Hog 1 phosphorylation, indicating that Ssk 1 is the major upstream signaling component of the Pbs 2 -Hog 1 pathway. A second response regulator, Skn 7, governs sensitivity to Na � ions and the antifungal agent fludioxonil, negatively controls melanin production, and functions independently of Hog 1 regulation. To control these response regulators, C. neoformans uses multiple sensor kinases, including two-component–like (Tco) 1 and Tco 2. Tco 1 and Tco 2 play shared and distinct roles in stress responses and drug sensitivity through the Hog 1 MAPK system. Furthermore, each sensor kinase mediates unique cellular functions for virulence and morphological differentiation.

Titan cells exhibit traits that promote survival in the host. Previous studies showed that titan cells are not phagocytosed and that increased titan cell production in the lungs results in reduced phagocytosis of cryptococcal cells by host immune cells. Here, the effect of titan cell production on host-pathogen interactions during early stages of pulmonary cryp-tococcosis was explored. The relationship between titan cell production and phagocytosis {{was found to be}} nonlinear; moderate increases in titan cell production resulted in profound decreases in phagocytosis, with significant differences occurring within the first 24 h of the infection. Not only were titan cells themselves protected from phagocytosis, but titan cell formation also con-ferred protection from phagocytosis to normal-size cryptococcal cells. Large particles introduced into the lungs were not phago-cytosed, suggesting the large size of titan cells protects against phagocytosis. The presence of large particles was unable to protect smaller particles from phagocytosis, revealing that titan cell size alone is not sufficient to provide the observed cross-protection of normal-size cryptococcal cells. These data suggest that titan cells {{play a critical role in}} establishment of the pulmonary infec-tion by promoting the survival of the entire population of cryptococcal cells.

During interactions with their host, human pathogenic fungi undergo an array of morphological changes that are tightly associated with virulence. Candida albicans switches between yeast cells and hyphae during infection. Thermally dimorphic pathogens, such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces species transform from hyphal growth to yeast cells in response to host stimuli. Coccidioides and Pneumocystis species produce spherules and cysts, respectively, which allow for the production of offspring in a protected environment. Finally, Cryptococcus species suppress hyphal growth and instead produce an array of yeast cells—from large polyploid titan cells to micro cells.
