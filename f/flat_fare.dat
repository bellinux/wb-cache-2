2500|$|From January 1980, special <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> were {{introduced}} for children travelling with the Railcard holder. [...] At first, {{up to four}} children (between 5 and 15 years of age inclusive) could travel per senior citizen, each paying £0.50 irrespective {{of the length of}} the journey. [...] This was increased to £1.00 on 1 February 1981. [...] From 12 March 1985, <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> only applied in Second Class accommodation. [...] Finally, on 5 January 1992, child discounts with the Railcard were withdrawn completely; any accompanying children now had to pay the normal child fare.|$|R

In addition, it implemented a FareBack program, which gives customers a portion of their ride cost back as credits to use on future Summon rides.|$|R
5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, the District and the Met saw {{increased}} competition in central London from the new electric deep-level tube lines. With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the December 28, 2014 fare increase, {{passengers}} paid a {{flat rate}} of RMB(¥) 2.00 (including unlimited fare-free transfers) for all lines except the Airport Express, which cost ¥25. The <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> {{was the lowest}} among metro systems in China.

25|$|On 4 October 1981, {{following}} the Greater London Council election, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named City and West End, where <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> {{applied for the}} first time. This {{was accompanied by a}} cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the Fares Fair campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Bus fares were doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three mile intervals; and thus grouping those stations within three miles of the central zones in an 'inner zone'.|$|R
50|$|The {{funicular}} tramway {{served a}} populous quarter of Paris. Because of this, the <b>flat</b> rate <b>fare</b> was quite low, 10 centimes, {{and there were}} half-rate worker's fares at the start {{and end of the}} day. Despite the low fares, its popularity made the company extremely profitable.|$|R
25|$|Both First Scotland East and Lothian Buses {{charge a}} single <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> {{regardless}} of distance, and operate a day ticket system, allowing unlimited travel on their buses {{during the day}}.

25|$|Current fares are $2.85 for a flag drop (first 1/9th mile), $.30 {{for each}} {{additional}} 1/9th mile ($2.70/mile), and $.30 for each 37 seconds of waiting and delay ($29.19/hour). A $46.50 <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> is mandated for all trips from Los Angeles International Airport to downtown Los Angeles. In addition, a $4.00 surcharge and $15.00 minimum is required for all trips originating from LAX.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two schools}} of thought in fare collections: a simple, <b>flat</b> rate <b>fare</b> {{structure}} (pay a fixed fare regardless of time of day and/or travel distance) or a complex, variable rate fare structure (pay a variable fare depending on time of day and/or travel distance).|$|R
50|$|The first zones were {{introduced}} on 4 October 1981. The whole of Greater London {{was divided into}} bus zones where <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> applied. On the London Underground the area that is now zone 1 was divided into two overlapping areas called City and West End. On 21 March 1982 fares to all other London Underground stations were graduated at three mile intervals—effectively creating zones—although they were not named as such until 1983 when the Travelcard product was launched covering five numbered zones. City and West End became zone 1 {{and the rest of}} Greater London was within zones 2, 3, 4 and 5. Further products were launched using the zones: One Day Travelcard (1984), Capitalcard (1985), One Day Capitalcard (1986). In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6.|$|R
50|$|Taxi {{service is}} {{relatively}} expensive {{due to the}} long distance to the airport, about 150RMB.

However, the original <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> were abandoned in July 1906 and replaced with graded fares of between 1d. and 3d. In November 1906, season tickets were introduced along with through tickets with the District Railway (interchanging at Charing Cross). It was not until December 1907 {{that it was possible}} to buy a through ticket onto the Central London Railway (via Oxford Circus). The BS abolished its season tickets in October 1908 and replaced them with strip tickets, sold in sets of six, that could be used on the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Hampstead tubes.|$|R
50|$|In North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, the {{majority}} of the cities use simple, <b>flat</b> rate <b>fare</b> structures due to budgetary constraints. With {{the majority}} of North America, most of South America, almost all of Africa, and most of Oceania being heavily reliant on the automobile for both short and long distance travel, majority of the transit budgets are allocated toward construction and maintenance of freeways and roads, with very little funding making way to investments in new mass transit technologies. Inadvertently however, the reliance on simpler fare structures due to their cheaper costs ends up increasing the tax burden on the agencies as <b>flat</b> rate <b>fare</b> structures have lower farebox recovery ratios, placing more pressure to the transit agencies to increase taxes, pursue higher fare hikes, or to cut services to maintain the transit system.|$|R

25|$|A two-tier <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> {{structure}} is in operation within the West Midlands county boundary; {{there is a}} standard single fare for any distance and a cheaper short-hop fare. Cash fares can be bought from the driver on the bus, but as with some other urban operators, no change is given for security and speed of boarding. Child fares are available at half the adult cost. Graduated fares apply on some services outside the West Midlands. In 2015, NXWM started taking fares on the Transport for West Midlands(previously Centro) Swift smart card.|$|E
25|$|From the MAX system's opening until 2012, riding {{was free}} in Fareless Square (known as the Free Rail Zone from 2010 to 2012), which {{included}} all of downtown and, starting in 2001, {{part of the}} Lloyd District. The 37-year-old fare-free zone was discontinued on September 1, 2012, as part of systemwide cost-cutting measures. As {{part of the same}} budget cuts, TriMet discontinued its zonal fares, moving to a <b>flat</b> <b>fare</b> system. Zones had been in place since 1986, with higher fares for longer rides, and three fare zones (five until 1988).|$|E
25|$|When {{it first}} opened, the line used its own paper-based {{ticketing}} {{system that was}} separate from the semi-integrated ticketing systems used by the government owned operators. The light rail operated on a proof-of-payment system, with ticket vending machines provided at all stops. By the time the Lilyfield extension opened, the machines had been switched off and replaced with onboard conductors. Paper tickets were available in single or return with fares based on two zones. Other products available included <b>Flat</b> <b>fare</b> day and weekly tickets, some of which also included travel on the monorail prior to that system's closure.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{publication}} of the plan, orders were made for the new buses. It was calculated that 450 new buses would be needed per annum. As there was insufficient time to design a bus specifically for London Transport, it was decided to standardise on the 36 foot m Merlin that had been used for the pioneer Red Arrow service. The long single deck vehicles were able to carry as many passengers as the 22 foot m long RT double deckers they were to replace. The buses for the satellite suburban services were fitted with automatic fare collecting equipment developed jointly by London Transport and Setright Registers. There were two consoles on each bus, situated between the front wheel arches. Although there were to be <b>flat</b> <b>fares</b> on the new routes the machines also had to allow for reduced child fares, and accepted 3d, 6d and one shilling coins. One of the two machines also had a slot to accept pre-paid tickets, although this facility was never used.|$|R
5000|$|Single Journey (Unitário in Portuguese): This is {{the most}} popular option.
