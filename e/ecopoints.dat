40|$|In late 1997, the EU Commission {{reviewed}} its Transit Agreement with Austria, {{concluding that}} the <b>ecopoints</b> systems was an effective means to reduce pollution caused by lorries driving through Austria. Yet heavy transport frequencies continued {{to grow in the}} sensitive Alpine valleys, the result of the carriers' practice of rerouting transports {{to get the most out}} of their quota of <b>ecopoints</b> and the increased use of ECMT permits. And in spite of the <b>ecopoints</b> scheme, carriers did not always use state-of-the art "environmentally friendly" lorries. Carriers from Greece, the U. K. and Ireland in particular appeared to have sufficient <b>ecopoints</b> at their disposal to use their obsolete, highly polluting lorries for Alpine transports, putting an undue burden on the environment. Before expiry of the Transit Agreement, i. e., by 2003 at the latest, proposals are to be developed to achieve a sustainable solution to the transit problem. Transports through sensitive regions could be subject to road-pricing to reflect the external costs produced by them. All of the lorry transport in these zones, including spot, source and destination traffic, is to be governed by limits for noise and pollutant emissions which are to be set as low as possible. In addition, noise barriers, speed limits and a ban on night driving are to reduce the environmental burden. Nevertheless efforts need to be made to reduce pollution from passenger cars as well in order to achieve a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the Alpine valleys suffering from transit traffic.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the {{assumptions}} for integrated assessment of buildings quality {{in the context of}} sustainable development principles. The sustainable (or “green”) buildings are cost effective, environmentally friendly and conserving natural resources. The buildings are comfortable for the users, are also healthy and optimally integrated into socio-cultural environment; thereby have long maintained their high added value – for investors, owners as well as users. Design methodology/approach: The methodology of the paper consists in analyses of certification systems that assess buildings sustainability within wider environmental, economic and social relations. An effort to increase the quality of construction and to provide objectified assessment with measurable and comparable results has evoked the origin and development of the tools for buildings sustainability assessment. In the case study, there are analysed the approaches into assessment of one from few certified sustainable projects in Slovakia “EcoPoint Office Center Kosice”. The results are destined for potential investors perhaps even for present owners that have ambitions and responsibility for building sustainability principles performance when designing and using their properties. Findings: The results of the research imply identification of the key characteristics expressing the comprehensive quality of the building and are leading to specification of practical and social implications that are provided by the sustainability philosophy. Originality/value: The force of the paper is to mention the approaches into integrated assessment of construction quality in the context of sustainability principles and the importance of their more extensive implementation in Slovakia. The approaches into the sustainability principles performance as well as the real benefits of the sustainable building are declared through case study of the building <b>EcoPoint</b> Office Center Košice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Facing the {{increase}} of environmental concern in the water treatment field, stakeholders need reliable decision support tools to assess environmental performances of urban and industrial wastewater systems. To discuss how life cycle assessment (LCA) {{can be applied to}} wastewater treatment projects, such an assessment has been performed through a case study on a full-scale plant. Methodological issues that had to be dealt with are briefly exposed. Five life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods have been used: CML 2000, Eco Indicator 99, EDIP 96, EPS and <b>Ecopoints</b> 97. Consistent assessment between these methods has been obtained for greenhouse effect, resources depletion and acidification. Eutrophication is correctly estimated if one looks at the potential impact of a treatment scenario but not at the characterization of the eutrophication state of a specific receiving stream. Work is needed concerning human toxicity as large discrepancies are noticed between the impact assessment methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{a method}} to analyze a product or service {{from the beginning of}} the process where it is extracted until it is not useful anymore or it is known as cradle-to-grave analysis. LCA analysis includes the inventory collecting all types of emission and waste. After this is done, the inventory will be interpreted to the environmental impacts in Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Two LCIA methods identified are Midpoint and Endpoint approaches. The Ecological Scarcity (<b>Ecopoints)</b> is an LCIA method using Midpoint approach. From the analysis to both life cycle stages analysis for potable water production which are construction stage and production stage indicate that both stages contribute two main impacts namely NOx dan SOx. In production stage, NOx and SOx were released from PAC production. On the other hand for the construction stage, NOx and SOx were released from steel production process.

The work is carried out {{as part of an}} ALTENER project focussing on solar and passive ventilation for urban buildings. The study involves the collection of information for current building stock in four European countries; UK, France, Spain and Greece. It includes data on the percentage of buildings by type (residential and non-domestic such as offices and educational) in each country and the percentage of urban building in relation to the total building stock. Such information is difficult to obtain in the same form for each country and the collected data are presented in as meaningful a form as possible. In particular, an attempt was made to define the 'urbanness' of buildings in relation to data available from national surveys.

40|$|In {{this study}} two {{desalination}} technologies have been compared {{by means of}} LCA with the focus on energy supply {{with a variety of}} scenarios based on different assumptions. The studied technologies are reverse osmosis and the newly developed technology Memstill where electrical energy demand is reduced by using external thermal energy source and use of chemicals is reduced. The scenarios are chosen to simulate different locations of sea water desalination plants and to demonstrate the impact of energy demand and energy source, chemical use and longer components' life times on the environment. The results show the dominant impact of energy demand on the overall results for all applied environmental impact assessment methods; transports, material and even chemical use are of negligible impact on the total score. The use of waste heat in case of Memstill offers a great opportunity to reduce the negative environmental impacts related to energy use.

40|$|Amsterdam has the {{ambition}} to develop as a competitive and sustainable European metropolis. The flows of energy, water and resources within the urban environment {{have a large}} potential to contribute to this ambition. The overall mass balances of phosphate, food, water, energy and material imports in the Amsterdam region have already been mapped. Through a transition from a linear usage of resources and waste production without feedbacks of resources, towards a sustainable management of urban resources with circular flows of resources, the sustainability of cities can be increased. This Urban Harvesting Concept can be applied in Amsterdam. The challenge is to operationalize this concept in practice. Two municipal companies in Amsterdam, Waternet and AEB, take initiatives to create closed cycles within their working areas. Waternet is the water company of Amsterdam and surroundings responsible for all water activities. AEB is the company which operates two waste-to-energy plants in Amsterdam. The focus is on water, energy, waste and material flows. Integration of these cycles {{is also part of}} the initiatives. These circular flows result in economic benefits and sustainability benefits, either expressed as <b>Ecopoints</b> or CO 2 -emissions. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The functional unit is an axial air compressor manufactured by FINI COMPRESSORI, lubricated, having a 25 -litres air tank, provided by 1. 8 kW electrical motor. The system boundaries include raw material extraction {{and the end of}} life of the compressor. All metallic materials have the recycling as waste scenario. The LCA is obtained by using the SimaPro 3. 1 code and the two methods Eco-indicator 95 and <b>Ecopoints.</b> The results show that air tank and stator of electrical motor are the components with greater environmental damage, even if the damage is mainly due to the electrical energy consumed during use. The most important categories of damage produced by the air tank are carcinogenic substances, heavy metals and acidification due to the material and processes used for its manufacturing and the ones produced by aluminium part of stator are acidification and winter smog due to material manufacturing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present both the {{political}} and educational actions that are the major subjects of bill on management of batteries in Rio Claro city, SP, Brazil. While the political actions refer to the furthering of a bill approved recently in the local Youth Parliament  for presentation in the Board of Aldermen, the educational actions relate to the creation of an environmental education program to orient the disposal of batteries at the municipal level. The National Policy on Solid Waste (Law 12, 305 passed in 2010) introduced mechanisms to accomplish the shared responsibility for the lifecycle of batteries (and other products) and reverse logistics. This law classified batteries into the category of toxic waste. The study that supported the writing of the bill included an analysis of the existing public and private initiatives on batteries´ collection in Rio Claro seeking treatment in major urban centers having the reverse logistics as a premise. In recognition of the importance of the environmental education program, the local Education Secretariat, supported by Sepladema, has defined a schedule for the lectures to be given in public schools.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} amount of cement that is used globally, the {{production}} of cement has a large impact on the environment. The area of Alkali Activated Materials (AAMs) has become a promising research avenue in the search for a low-carbon emission alternative to Portland cement based concrete. There {{has been a lot of}} research into using sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and potassium hydroxide activation of industrial by-products like blast furnace slag and fly ash. However, environmental impact research in AAMs has shown large impacts from the activators used. This study examines initial setting time, compressive strength, environmental impact, and cost of sodium carbonate activated blast furnace slag as a function of their ingredients. This is done via a statistically designed mixture experiment to analyze mechanical properties and a comparative LCA using SimaPro to determine environmental impacts. The study concludes that sodium carbonate activated blast furnace slag (SCABFS) materials can be designed to meet ASTM standards for concrete initial setting time and compressive strength. Overall environmental impact of Portland cement based binder as measured by ReCiPe <b>ecopoints</b> is reduced by 33 % in SCABFS binder if slag is considered a waste product of steel production. If slag is not considered to be a waste product of steel production, the SCABFS binder exhibited significantly higher overall environmental impacts than Portland cement binder...|$|E

The wastes and the way they have been "handled" are some of the indicators of this problematic situation that negatively affects the environment and public health. Waste production has been increasing, reached in 2005, a total of 145 thousand tonnes more than predicted for 2010 (Direção Geral do Ambiente-DGA, 2012). In the city of Porto Novo, Santo Antão Island, the study area, with less than 10 thousand inhabitants, in 2010, according to the Plan and developing of Santo Antão (PDSA, 2011), were produced about of 1100 tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW). The current management system consists of undifferentiated collection, transport and landfilled in the city dump, where medical waste are also disposed and burned. The remaining wastes are inappropriately disposed by the population creating critical situations of pollution, which occurs throughout the national territory. This work aims to propose some suggestions for the improvement of MSW management through the elaboration of a MSW management plan for the city of Porto Novo: proposing a selective collection for recyclable waste, using <b>ecopoints,</b> and biodegradable, and collecting some specific waste streams for recycling. The implementation of this plan requires the construction of a treatment centre to MSW management (already designed) which includes a controlled landfill, sorting and composting units. With the construction of a landfill, it was proposed the decommissioning and the area requalification of the dum...|$|E
40|$|A {{transparent}} and comparable {{understanding of the}} energy efficiency, carbon footprint, and environmental impacts of renewable resources are required in the decision making and planning process towards a more sustainable energy system. Therefore, a new approach is proposed for measuring the environmental sustainability of anaerobic digestion green gas production pathways. The approach {{is based on the}} industrial metabolism concept, and is expanded with three known methods. First, the Material Flow Analysis method is used to simulate the decentralized energy system. Second, the Material and Energy Flow Analysis method is used to determine the direct energy and material requirements. Finally, Life Cycle Analysis is used to calculate the indirect material and energy requirements, including the embodied energy of the components and required maintenance. Complexity will be handled through a modular approach, which allows for the simplification of the green gas production pathway while also allowing for easy modification {{in order to determine the}} environmental impacts for specific conditions and scenarios. Temporal dynamics will be introduced in the approach through the use of hourly intervals and yearly scenarios. The environmental sustainability of green gas production is expressed in (Process) Energy Returned on Energy Invested, Carbon Footprint, and <b>EcoPoints.</b> The proposed approach within this article can be used for generating and identifying sustainable solutions. By demanding a clear and structured Material and Energy Flow Analysis of the production pathway and clear expression for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability the analysis or model can become more {{transparent and}} therefore easier to interpret and compare. Hence, a clear ruler and measuring technique can aid in the decision making and planning process towards a more sustainable energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Replacement {{of fossil}} fuels by more {{sustainable}} fuels such as biofuels has become increasingly important during the last decade. This is mainly due to economical and environmental reasons. This thesis describes a study, both theoretical and experimental, of the fundamentals of superheated steam drying of biofuels and an investigation of biofuel systems where a super heated steam dryer is integrated with heat and power production. The fundamental studies show {{that it is possible}} and enlightening to describe the equilibrium moisture content of wood in moist air and in superheated steam in an analogous way. The equilibrium moisture content depends on the activity of the superheated steam, the temperature and the material. The experimental results show that the release of organic compounds depends on the temperature of the superheated steam, the drying time and the age of the chips. The formation rate is strongly dependent on temperature. It has been shown that life cycle assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool in comparing different alternatives for heat and power production and for environmental optimisation of biofuel systems. Different evaluation methods show that Case 2 (dried biofuel) is an improvement over Case 1 (wet biofuel and coal). Of major importance is the large reduction of fossil CO 2 of Case 2 compared to Case 1. The environmental impact of the organic compounds from the exhaust gas during the drying is estimated to be small. In this study a new approach to dynamic situations is taken where the environmental impact is expressed as cumulative formation of <b>ecopoints</b> (or equivalent). Drying until the limit at a low temperature (until the constant rate is ended) is preferred. The economical optimum is different from the environmental optimum. Pareto-curves may support the decision making process when combined economic and environmental optima are required...|$|E
40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} and sustainability of an anaerobic green gas production pathway was evaluated, taking into account five biomass feedstocks, optimization of the green gas production pathway, replacement of current waste management pathways by mitigation, and transport of the feedstocks. Sustainability is expressed by three main factors: efficiency in (Process) Energy Returned On Invested (P) EROI, carbon footprint in Global Warming Potential GWP(100), and environmental impact in <b>EcoPoints.</b> The green gas production pathway operates on a mass fraction of 50 % feedstock with 50 % manure. The sustainability of the analyzed feedstocks differs substantially, favoring biomass waste flows over, the specially cultivated energy crop, maize. The use of optimization, {{in the shape of}} internal energy production, green gas powered trucks, and mitigation can significantly improve the sustainability for all feedstocks, but favors waste materials. Results indicate a possible improvement from an average (P) EROI for all feedstocks of 2. 3 up to an average of 7. 0 GJ/GJ The carbon footprint can potentially be reduced from an average of 40 down to 18 kgCO(2) eq/GJ. The environmental impact can potentially be reduced from an average of 5. 6 down to 1. 8 Pt/GJ. Internal energy production proved to be the most effective optimization. However, the use of optimization aforementioned will result in les green gas injected into the gas grid as it is partially consumed internally. Overall, the feedstock straw was the most energy efficient, where the feedstock harvest remains proved to be the most environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, transport distances of all feedstocks should not exceed 150 km or emissions and environmental impacts will surpass those of natural gas, used as a reference. Using green gas as a fuel can increase the acceptable transportation range to over 300 km. Within the context aforementioned and from an {{energy efficiency}} and sustainable point of view, the anaerobic digestion process should be utilized for processing locally available waste feedstocks with the added advantage of producing energy, which should first be used internally for powering the green gas production process.

Os anos em estudo foram de 2009 a 2013 e os dados anteriormente referidos foram obtidos através da {{consulta}} do sítio da internet da ERSUC, empresa gestora dos resíduos urbanos. Por outro lado, com a informação recolhida da tipologia dos camiões de recolha e do ano de matrícula, recorreu-se ao programa COPERT IV para obter as quantidades de CO 2 emitidos por fluxo de resíduos, tendo conseguido fazer um balanço, recorrendo ao software do site norte americano STOPWASTE. Com esta calculadora, e fazendo as adaptações necessárias à realidade portuguesa, conseguimos calcular a quantidade de CO 2 que se deixa de emitir para a atmosfera ao fazer a reciclagem das quantidades de resíduos recolhidos. De referir que foi usada a percentagem de 6 % como taxa de refugo, segundo os dados obtidos através da ERSUC. Assim, verificou-se que temos um balanço muito positivo no que respeita às quantidades de CO 2 que são poupadas com a reciclagem dos resíduos provenientes dos ecopontos comparativamente com a quantidade de CO 2 emitido com a sua recolha e encaminhamento para a estação de triagem. É certo que no presente estudo não foram contemplados os quilómetros percorridos e as consequentes emissões de CO 2 com o transporte da estação de triagem para as empresas recicladoras. Por outro lado, o presente estudo permitiu chegar à conclusão que também conseguimos poupar energia ao reciclarmos os materiais recolhidos, quando comparamos com a energia que é gasta com a recolha e transporte destes mesmos materiais.

40|$|Competitive {{industries}} in the manufacturing sector have a holistic Life Cycle Management (LCM) view of business practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which forms part of the LCM approach, is increasingly used as a decision support tool in the South African manufacturing industry. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase of the LCA tool has been standardised within the ISO 14000 family and aims to quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} economic activities. A number of LCIA methodologies have been developed in Europe, which can be applied directly when life cycle systems are assessed. The LCIA procedures that are most commonly used in the South African manufacturing industry include the CML, <b>Ecopoints,</b> EPS and Eco-indicators 95 and 99 procedures. The five European methods are evaluated based on the applicability of the respective classification, characterisation, normalisation and weighting elements for the South African situation. The evaluation and comparison is further based on a cradle-to-gate Screening Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) case study of the production of dyed two-fold wool yarn in South Africa. Shortcomings are identified with the European methodologies in the South African context in terms of comprehensiveness and modelling approaches. A LCIA framework and calculation procedure, termed the Resource Impact Indicator (RII) model, is subsequently proposed for South Africa, which is based on the protection of four natural resource groups: water, air, land, and mined abiotic resources. A distance-to-target approach is used for the normalisation of midpoint categories, which focuses on the ambient quality and quantity objectives for the four resource groups. The quality and quantity objectives are determined for defined South African Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA) regions and take into account endpoint or damage targets. Following the precautionary approach, RIIs are calculated for the resource groups from conventional Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs). The calculation of the RIIs ensures that all natural resources that are important from a South African perspective are duly considered in a LCIA. The results of a LCIA are consequently not reliant on detailed LCIs and the number of midpoint categories that converge on a single resource group. The proposed model is evaluated with the SLCA wool case study. The case study establishes the importance of region-specificity, for LCIs and LCIAs. The proposed LCIA model further demonstrates reasonable ease of communication of LCIA results to decision-makers or managers. Subjective weighting values for the resource groups are also proposed, based on survey results from manufacturing industry sectors in the South African automotive value chain, and the expenditure of the South African national government on environmental issues. The subjective weighting values are used to calculate overall Environmental Performance Resource Impact Indicators (EPRIIs) when comparing life cycle systems with each other. The EPRII approach is applied to a specific LCM problem in the South African context, i. e. evaluating and comparing environmental performance for supply chain management purposes in the developing country context. Thereby, RIIs are provided for key Cleaner Production process parameters in the South Africa context: water usage, energy usage, and waste produced per manufactured product.
