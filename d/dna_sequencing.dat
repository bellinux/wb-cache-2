A k-convex polygon simplifies a walk plot by removing some parts of insignificant information of a walk plot.

40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> {{analysis}} {{is of great}} significance for increasing our understanding of genomic functions. An important task facing us is the exploration of hidden structural information stored in the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> This paper introduces a DNA structure-based adaptive wavelet transform (WT) – the bionic wavelet transform (BWT) – for <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis. The symbolic <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> can be separated into four channels of indicator sequences.

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for <b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and <b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood.

Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as <b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E

5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> of both {{mitochondrial}} {{and nuclear}} genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. <b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species are}} {{difficult}} or impossible to distinguish from each other using observable characteristics; laboratory incompatibility tests are often used on pure cultures to reliably determine species.
