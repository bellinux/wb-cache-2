25|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{differences between}} the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower than Thomas; he cannot jump as high, but he can kick heavy obstacles out of his way and take more damage from enemy fire. He cannot aim as far as Thomas, but he is faster with six shooters, which he can dual wield, and is quicker when aiming at nearby enemies. Thomas can move faster than Ray, and can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. He has a better long range aim than Ray, but is slower when using six shooters, which he can only single wield, and when aiming at nearby enemies. Ray can use two weapons unavailable to Thomas - a <b>dismountable</b> gatling gun and throwable dynamite. Thomas can use three weapons Ray cannot - a lasso, a bow and arrow and throwing knives. Weapons common to both characters include various types of six shooters, rifles and shotguns. Both characters can also can start fires by throwing or shooting oil lamps. They are also both capable of using chairs in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
25|$|Anti-tank guided weapons (ATGMs) can be {{operated}} by the BMD-3. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided Fagot (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The 9P135M launcher is located on the top center of the BMD-3 turret and is <b>dismountable.</b> The crew can engage targets from the vehicle or a distance away from the system. The ATGM launcher has three ready-to-use rounds and two stowed in the vehicle. The Fagot missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. A French-German Flame-V adapter kit allows the BMD-3 to launch MILAN ATGMs.|$|E

50|$|IMVs were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} threats of modern counter insurgency warfare, with an emphasis on Ambush Protection and Mine-Resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French VAB and South African Buffel. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. It is a neologism for what might have been classified in the past as an armoured scout car, such as the BRDM, but the IMV is distinguished by having a requirement to carry <b>dismountable</b> infantry. The up-armoured M1114 Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reference}} to the instrument in Ireland is provided by John O'Keefe in (1760) {{as an instrument of}} polite society and the emerging 'Pastoral' and prototype Union pipe influenced the folk tradition of the 18th and 19th century in Scotland and Ireland. This {{can be thought of as}} a shared tradition which served a Neo-baroque orchestral and concert fashion but also drew strongly on the ‘native traditions’ of both Scotland and Ireland and the music styles of the times.The pastoral pipes can be played either standing or in a seated position using a set of bellows, and the chanter is similar to the later Union pipes, but it had an added foot joint that extended its range one tone lower. This added foot joint had holes in its sides in addition to the hole at the bottom of the bore. The pastoral pipes are like the Highland pipes in that the sound is continuous; notes are articulated by finger techniques such as gracenotes. The Union pipes, which evolved from the pastoral pipes, enable the player to interrupt the flow of air by stopping the end of the chanter on his knee; this doesn't work for the Pastoral instrument because of the side tone holes. Many later Pastoral sets, though, have a <b>dismountable</b> foot joint; when this is removed they can be played as union pipes. The surviving instruments indicate that the Pastoral pipes had two or three drones and generally one regulator.|$|E
5000|$|The stadium design {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} media, with reviews ranging from [...] "magnificent" [...] to a [...] "bowl of blancmange". The design was promoted as example of [...] "sustainable development", but some architecture critics have questioned both its aesthetic value and suitability as a national icon - especially when compared to Beijing National Stadium. For example, Ellis Woodman, Building Designs architecture critic, said of the design: [...] "The principle of it being <b>dismountable</b> is most welcome... it demonstrates an obvious interest in establishing an economy of means and as such {{is the antithesis of}} the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing. But while thats an achievement, its not an architectural achievement. In design terms what were looking at is pretty underwhelming." [...] He went on to criticise the procurement and design processes - stating of the latter that it should have been subject to an architectural competition. This view was echoed by Tom Dyckhoff, The Timess architecture critic, who described the design as [...] "tragically underwhelming" [...] and commented that the [...] "architecture of the 2008 and 2012 Olympics will, in years to come, be seen by historians as a [...] "cunning indicator of the decline of the West {{and the rise of the}} East".Despite the criticism the Olympic Stadium was nominated for the 2012 Stirling Prize in architecture losing out to the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.|$|E
5000|$|The whaleboat's design takes {{after those}} the Vikings {{used during the}} 11th century, around the time Beowulf was written and Leif Erickson came to America briefly. As a whaling vessel, it {{fulfilled}} its purposes for what it went through and its “superior handling characteristics soon made it a popular general-purpose ship’s boat”. The whaleboat generally is outfitted with a <b>dismountable</b> sail post for sailing across seas, but in close proximity, they can use oars for rapid rowing to nearby areas with a large rowing crew. The basics of the whaleboat consists of a rudder, main sail, and occasionally a jib. Without the rudder, the boat would have no steering capabilities, and without the sails, the vessel would have no propulsion, assuming there were no oars or a sizable rowing crew {{to compensate for the}} lack of propulsion. After 1850 most were fitted with a centreboard that would keep the boat from swaying too far to one side or another, located {{in the center of the}} boat.The main sail would catch the wind, which would in turn push the sail, pushing the boat in the process, and the rudder, depending on the direction the person manning it pointed it at, would push the stern of the boat in a certain direction, steering the whaleboat essentially. The rudder consists of basically two parts: the part that sticks in the water in order to give thrust, and the part the coxswain, or the person steering, holds onto in order to push or pull the first part. The jib sail is a significantly smaller sail that serves to help steer and propel the boat forward as well. By catching the wind at a specific angle, the sail can either double as a second main sail catching the wind, or help by adding “better close-hauled sailing and of setting extra sail with comparatively little labor demand” ...|$|E
