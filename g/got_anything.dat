It's a sad state when more people retweet than buy records." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of the {{painting}} {{as a work of}} art has been predominantly negative. The historian David Starkey described it as [...] "an appallingly bad picture and there's absolutely no reason to suppose it's <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Lady Jane Grey", a sentiment which the art dealer Christopher Foley echoed. Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery gave less sharp criticism, stating [...] "it's a paint-by-number, labored copy", and [...] "its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art". Zarin describes {{the painting}} as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs, with [...] "the flat face of a paper doll". Edwards writes [...] "the quality might be described as naive, primitive, or even folk art".|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{started the}} first few matches of the 2014–15 season, but with the loan signing of Jason Steele from Middlesbrough, he was dropped from the first team. On 15 November 2014, Robinson {{announced}} his intentions of leaving the club in the January transfer window. He said that, [...] "I'm pretty much surplus to requirements at Blackburn. I'm {{not even on the}} bench. I'm training hard at the moment though. My contract is {{up at the end of}} the season so I'm not sure if that's <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> to do with it.

500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
500|$|In week two, the Giants {{defeated}} the San Diego Chargers 20–7 {{in front of}} 74,921 fans at Giants Stadium. The Giants led the Chargers 10–7 after three quarters before scoring 10 {{in the fourth quarter}} to put the game out of reach. Joe Morris rushed 30 times for 83yards and defensive backs Terry Kinard and Kenny Hill intercepted two passes each. Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts threw five second half interceptions. [...] "We took away their outside running game and their short passes", Giants' defensive coordinator Bill Belichick said. [...] "When Fouts tried to go deep, that's when we got interceptions." [...] The Giants dominated the Chargers in time of possession; 39 minutes 44 seconds to the Chargers' 20 minutes 16 seconds. The Giants defense forced eight turnovers overall, and held the Chargers to 41 rushing yards on 13 carries. After the game Fouts complimented the Giants defense, [...] "There was no comparing the Giants' defense with the Dolphins' defense (the Chargers scored 50 points and totalled 500yards against the Dolphins in week one). We never <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> established against the Giants. Momma said there would be days like this, and she was right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We always talked about releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> pressed until we had signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree {{of all the people}} in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good."

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed to Australia and the United States in March and April 1973, Anderson pitched his idea to Howe, a {{prolific}} songwriter and arranger {{in the group}} who {{took an interest in}} the concept. In their spare time between performances on the tour, the two proceeded to hold [...] "candlelight writing sessions" [...] in their hotel rooms, sharing musical ideas and motifs that suited the album's themes. Howe recalled: [...] "Jon would say to me, 'What have you got that's a bit like that...?' so I'd play him something and he'd go: 'that's great. Have you <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> else?' and I'd play him another tune". One riff that Howe played for Anderson was rejected at first, but it was later incorporated into [...] "The Ancient" [...] as by then, the two sought for a different theme that would suit the track. In one marathon session in Savannah, Georgia, Anderson and Howe completed the outline of the vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation in six hours that ended at 7:00 a.m; by which time, the album took shape {{in the form of a}} double concept album of four side-long tracks. Anderson described the night as [...] "magical" [...] that [...] "left both of us exhilarated for days". When the album was announced to the rest of the group, Howe recalled an agreement to a double album, but one with just four tracks was met with some resistance. [...] "But Jon and I did manage to sell the idea ... sometimes [...] really had to spur the guys on".|$|E
2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that {{performance}} of a contract always had to take place. No matter what hardship was encountered contracting parties had absolute liability on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners did not have to pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a contract is not frustrated merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of frustration is a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a force majeure clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the force majeure clause did cover it. The effect of a contract being frustrated is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not <b>got</b> <b>anything</b> in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|E
