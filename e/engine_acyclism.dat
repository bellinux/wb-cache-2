40|$|International audienceThis work proposes an {{original}} approach to detect rattle noise in car gearboxes. Rattle noise {{is produced by}} vibro impacts between teeth of unloaded gears. These impacts are principally caused by the <b>engine</b> <b>acyclism</b> transmitted to the primary shaft of the gearbox after being partially filtered by the clutch. The appearance {{and the level of}} rattle noise depend, among others, on the operating conditions and more particularly on the rotation speed. The interest is then here focused on tests in run up conditions in order to scan a large panel of operating conditions. The objective of this work is to develop an efficient method to detect rattle noise in signals based on an angle-time cyclostationary approach. The results are compared to a more intrusive detection methodology exploiting signals issued from optical encoders...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work proposes an {{original}} approach to detect rattle noise of automotive gearbox under non-stationary conditions. Rattle noise {{is produced by}} vibro impacts between teeth of unloaded gears and principally caused by the <b>engine</b> <b>acyclism.</b> A test bench with a universal joint is used to generate acyclism and to permit the appearance of rattle noise during speed ramp. One optical encoder is placed inside the gearbox to access the instantaneous angular speed of one loose gear and two other encoders are placed {{at the end of}} the primary and secondary shafts outside the gearbox. First of all the relative speed of the unloaded meshing gears is observed to directly detect the instants of impact. These results are compared with {{an original}} method of detection based on an angle/time cyclostationary approach. The advantage is to keep the angle/time duality to characterize this phenomenon: the cyclic frequency expressed in events per revolution is indeed directly linked to the periodicity of the impacts while their nature is linked to the bandwidth expressed in Hertz...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work proposes an {{original}} non-intrusive approach {{to detect and}} quantify rattle noise in automotive gearboxes operating under non-stationary conditions by means of vibration or instantaneous angular speed measurements. Rattle noise is produced by vibro impacts between teeth of unloaded gears excited by the <b>engine</b> <b>acyclism.</b> It appears during acceleration or deceleration phases and its detection requires the analysis of non-stationary signals. In order {{to take advantage of}} the repetitive nature of the impacts, an angle/time cyclostationary approach is introduced. Rattle noise is thus characterized through the angle/time duality: the cyclic frequency expressed in events per revolution is directly linked to the periodicity of the impacts while their frequency content is expressed in Hertz. The proposed detection method uses an order/frequency spectral coherence and may be applied either on vibration signals or instantaneous angular speed signals. For validation purposes, a specific instrumentation of a gearbox is set up. The relative speed of the unloaded meshing gears is observed by means of optical encoders to directly detect the instants of impact which then serve as a basis for validation of the non-intrusive detection method proposed in this paper...|$|E
