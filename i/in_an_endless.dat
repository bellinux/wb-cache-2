Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{prayer is}} {{considered}} acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a minyan—is {{the most highly}} recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means {{over the age of}} 12 or 13 (bat or bar mitzvah). Judaism had originally counted only men in the minyan for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the minyan. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a minyan mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a minyan. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. In Orthodox Judaism, according to some authorities, women can count in the minyan for certain specific prayers, such as the Birchot HaGomel blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.|$|E

25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum up the courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E

500|$|In {{his essay}} Love is a Stranger, {{published}} in {{the first volume of}} the Doctor Who Magazine— Special Edition, David Bailey highlights the central idea that [...] "...the lives of little people are precious, special and worth fighting for.....the Eternals may have unimaginable power at their fingertips but they lack, and are jealous of, one thing: the ability to live, and die." [...] The hollowness of immortality was a thread that ran through Season 20, with the earlier story Mawdryn Undead showing Mawdryn trapped <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> cycle of painful regeneration, while in The Five Doctors, Borusa's prize of immortality results in little more than a living death. The horror of eternal life is brought home when the Black Guardian threatens Turlough with immortality as a punishment for failure, something that drives him to try and commit suicide rather than face eternity.|$|E

500|$|Filchner's {{view that}} the {{supposed}} sighting of New South Greenland {{could be explained by}} a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage. One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a Fata Morgana, distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account South, Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on [...] 1915, coincidentally as his ship Endurance drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: [...] "The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> transformation scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> loop, due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E

Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field, while players on the Yankees, including former Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone and Mattingly felt Dent {{was used as a}} scapegoat. Dan Shaughnessy criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and said he should [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent.

500|$|The view {{of history}} propounded in this text is very {{strongly}} influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola {{are important to the}} interplay of the [...] "characters." [...] Vico propounded a cyclical {{view of history}}, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history {{is to be found in}} the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words [...] "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." [...] ("vicus" [...] is a pun on Vico) and ends [...] "A way a lone a last a loved a long the." [...] In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.

This coincides with her line [...] "Sometime I wished/For a mistake," [...] referencing her desire to get pregnant.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount {{life on the}} home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and [...] "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant." [...] Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely {{from the perspective of}} a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that [...] "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper." [...] There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetition – of stories, events and deaths – used to give [...] "the impression of lives trapped <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>endless</b> war" [...] for which there is no end in sight.|$|E
