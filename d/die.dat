5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the <b>die</b> cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the <b>die.</b> All <b>die</b> cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the <b>die</b> require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the <b>die.</b> <b>Die</b> castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the <b>die</b> and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a <b>die</b> {{casting process}} {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional <b>die</b> casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for <b>die</b> casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity <b>die</b> castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|Bosses {{are added}} to <b>die</b> {{castings}} to serve as stand-offs and mounting points for parts that {{will need to be}} mounted. For maximum integrity and strength of the <b>die</b> casting, bosses must have universal wall thickness.|$|E

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection <b>die</b> casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection <b>die</b> casting or runnerless <b>die</b> casting, is a zinc <b>die</b> casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity.

50|$|In {{the side}} aisle, {{valuable}} medieval tomb stones of abbots have been arranged {{as a new}} display in 2004 and 2005. These tomb stones were originally in the crossing.

They {{were removed from the}} side walls, desalinated, restored and set, at a distance, against the walls, permitting a constant flow of air to avoid further damage. The tomb stones are now placed as follows: to the right side the two nameless abbots, followed by the abbots Martin I. (<b>died</b> 1339), Jakob (<b>died</b> 1361), Martin II. (<b>died</b> 1391), Johannes Plate (<b>died</b> 1420) as well as the vicar von Neuburg, Hermann von Giwertze (<b>died</b> 1449); to the left the abbots Gottschalk (<b>died</b> 1391), Hermann Bockholt (<b>died</b> 1423), Bernhard (<b>died</b> 1441), Johannes Wilkens (<b>died</b> 1489), Franz Meyne (<b>died</b> 1499) and Heinrich Mützel (<b>died</b> 1504).

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using <b>die</b> casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low.
