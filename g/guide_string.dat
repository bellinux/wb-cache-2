String-like amplitudes for scalar QED are reviewed and the technique is extended to pure and scalar QCD processes.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{building}} a set of Swedish goggles is to construct a nose piece. Nose pieces can feature a variety of designs, {{some of the most}} popular are the included string threaded through the included rubber tube, a short length of the included strap (which is much more easily adjusted than the string), or simply using the string as a nose piece. For nose pieces using the string and tube, a pair of tweezers can be used to <b>guide</b> the <b>string</b> through the small holes located on the inside of the frames, as well as into the rubber tube. A small knot is then tied by hand and threaded into the tube.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{is a small}} {{strip of}} bone, plastic, brass, corian, graphite, {{stainless}} steel, or other medium-hard material, at the joint where the headstock meets the fretboard. Its grooves <b>guide</b> the <b>strings</b> onto the fretboard, giving consistent lateral string placement. It {{is one of the}} endpoints of the strings' vibrating length. It must be accurately cut, or it can contribute to tuning problems due to string slippage or string buzz. To reduce string friction in the nut, which can adversely affect tuning stability, some guitarists fit a roller nut. Some instruments use a zero fret {{just in front of the}} nut. In this case the nut is used only for lateral alignment of the strings, the string height and length being dictated by the zero fret.|$|R

Application of the string discharge can be seen at the pharmaceutical and starch industries. String discharge is used if the high solid concentration slurry is used or if the slurry is easy to filter to produce cake formation or if the discharged solid is fibrous, stringy or pulpy or if a longer wear resistance is desired for the separation of the mentioned slurry.|$|R
40|$|Anti-D 3 branes and non-perturbative {{effects in}} flux compactifications spontaneously break {{supersymmetry}} and stabilise moduli in a metastable de Sitter vacua. The low energy 4 D {{effective field theory}} description for such models would be a supergravity theory with non-linearly realised supersymmetry. <b>Guided</b> by <b>string</b> theory modular symmetry, we compute this non-linear supergravity theory, including dependence on all bulk moduli. Using either a constrained chiral superfield or a constrained vector field, the uplifting contribution to the scalar potential from the anti-D 3 brane can be parameterised either as an F-term or Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term. Using again the modular symmetry, we show that 4 D non-linear supergravities that descend from string theory have an enhanced protection from quantum corrections by non-renormalisation theorems. The superpotential giving rise to metastable de Sitter vacua is robust against perturbative string-loop and α' corrections. Comment: 33 page...|$|R
50|$|At the 2008 Frankfurt Music Fair, Steingraeber & Söhne {{introduced}} a new grand piano that measures 232 cm in length, {{as well as a}} grand piano with a Carbon carbon fibre soundboard. This type of construction enhances stability when tuning instruments that are subject to extreme climatic fluctuations. If grand pianos are to be housed in the Tropics or played at outdoor concerts, for example, then carbon fibre soundboards make good sense. The left pedal mechanism has been enhanced: when a pianist depresses the left pedal, this causes the mechanism to shift in the usual way. If he/she continues to depress the pedal, the hammers move closer to the strings, which is similar to what happens in uprights. This facilitates playing at extremely soft, pianissimo dynamic levels. Steingraeber has developed an alternative means of <b>guiding</b> the <b>strings</b> over the bridge; it is based upon earlier ideas that were implemented in trials. Normally, the strings go over two bridge pins in a zigzag pattern. In the case of the Steingraeber alternative, bridge agraffes <b>guide</b> the <b>string</b> through a metal roller and press it down onto the bridge from above. In addition, height-adjustable hitch pins allow the string tension to be adjusted. The thinking behind this design feature is twofold: uniform string tension over the bridge improves energy transmission, and when significant string friction at the bridge pins no longer exists, the ability to tune and to hold a tuning is optimized. At the moment, these are not standard features in the production of grand pianos; clients may order them for an additional fee, however. At Steingraeber, a ball bearing mechanism is available {{as an alternative to the}} standard, leather-covered knuckle roller mechanism. Thus, a lower-friction release of the jack makes improved repetition possible. In upright pianos, Steingraeber incorporates a magnet, rather than a spring, into the tip of the jack and the hammer-butt. The magnet brings the jack back into operating position after the it releases. This system is maintenance free and results in faster, more precise repetition.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{that frequently}} use(d) a zero fret are Gretsch, Kay, Selmer, Höfner, Mosrite, Framus, Vox, Vigier and bass guitar manufacturer MTD. Now very few manufacturers use this design {{and those who}} do list it as a feature. Steinberger uses a zero fret with their headless guitars but omit the nut; strings are mounted in place where the head would normally be, so {{there is no need for}} the <b>string</b> <b>guides</b> that the nut provides. 2015 model year Gibson guitars incorporate a zero fret in order to accommodate a brass adjustable nut, which the manufacturer claims causes better sustain and intonation.|$|R
50|$|The tremolo {{system is}} made from an old hardened-steel {{knife-edge}} shaped into a V and two motorbike valve springs to counter the string tension. The tension of the springs can be adjusted by screwing the bolts, which run {{through the middle of}} the springs, in or out via two small access holes next to the rear strap button. To reduce friction, the bridge was completed with rollers to allow the strings to return perfectly in tune after using the tremolo arm (the arm itself was from a bicycle saddlebag holder with a plastic knitting needle tip). For the same reason, {{at the other end of}} the neck the strings pass over a zero fret and through a bakelite <b>string</b> <b>guide.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a concept of}} platoon movement of autonomous vehicles (smart cars). These vehicles have Adaptive or Advanced cruise control (ACC) system also called Intelligent cruise control (ICC) or Adaptive Intelligent cruise control (AICC) system. The vehicles are suitable to follow other vehicles on desired distance and to be organized in platoons. To perform a research on the control and stability of an AGV (Automated <b>Guided</b> Vehicles) <b>string,</b> we have developed a car-following model. To do this, first a single vehicle is modeled and since all cars in the platoon have the same dynamics, the single vehicle model is copied ten times to form model of platoon (string) with ten vehicles. To control this string, we have applied equal PID controllers to all vehicles, except the leading vehicle. These controllers {{try to keep the}} headway distance as constant as possible and the velocity error between subsequent vehicles - small. For control of vehicle with nonlinear dynamics combi­nation of feedforward control and feedback control approach is used. Feedforward control is based on the inverse model of nominal dynamics of the vehicle, and feedback PID control is designed based on the linearized model of the vehicle. For simulation and analysis of vehicle and platoon of vehicles – we have developed Matlab/Simulink models. Simulation results, discussions and conclusions are given {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{understanding}} the vacuum structure of super-symmetric gauge theories. More precisely, the theories considered here are N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories obtained through breaking of part of the supersym-metry from N = 2 gauge theories. The space of vacua of these theories has a very interesting and rich structure, only partly understood. This work proposes a new point of view on this problem, conjecturing a relation between the classification of certain special phases of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories and the mathematical problem of classifying a certain kind of graphs- Grothendieck’s “dessins s’enfants ”- according to the corresponding Galois invariants. The Seiberg-Witten solution of the parent N = 2 theory plays a crucial role in establishing this correspondence. ii Acknowledgements There {{are a lot of people}} without whose help and support I would not have been able to do the work that led to this thesis.

40|$|We {{consider}} high spin, s, long twist, L, planar operators (asymptotic Bethe Ansatz) {{of strong}} N= 4 SYM. Precisely, we compute the minimal anomalous dimensions for large 't Hooft coupling λ {{to the lowest}} order of the (string) scaling variable ℓ∼ L/ (S√(λ)) with GKP string size ∼S≡ 2 (s/√(λ)). At the leading order (S) ·ℓ ^ 2, we can confirm the O(6) non-linear sigma model description for this bulk term, without boundary term (S) ^ 0. Going further, we derive, extending the O(6) regime, the exact effect of the size finiteness. In particular, we compute, at all loops, the first Casimir correction ℓ ^ 0 /S (in terms of the infinite size O(6) NLSM), which reveals only one massless mode (out of five), as predictable once the O(6) description has been extended. Consequently, upon comparing with string theory expansion, at one loop our findings agree for large twist, while reveal for negligible twist, already at this order, the appearance of wrapping. At two loops, {{as well as for}} next loops and orders, we can produce predictions, which may <b>guide</b> future <b>string</b> computations.

5000|$|Acoustic {{baritone}} guitars {{typically have}} larger bodies than standard guitars, and—like electric baritones—have longer scale lengths so the strings can be tuned lower while remaining at normal tension. On a standard, steel-string, acoustic guitar, the scale length (the {{distance from the}} nut or <b>string</b> <b>guide</b> to the saddle on the bridge) is typically 24.9" [...] to 25.7", and the strings range in diameter from [...]012" [...] to [...]054". The scale lengths of various baritone designs range from 27" [...] to 30.5", and the string gauges range from the normal [...]012 - [...]054" [...] set to sets as thick as [...]017 - [...]095". Shorter-scale baritone guitars are more like long-scale guitars, having more midrange volume, whereas the longer scale lengths and heavier string sets give more bass to the instrument's timbre. Shorter scale baritones tend to be tuned C-C or B-B, whereas longer ones are typically tuned A-A.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Gopakumar-Ooguri-Vafa correspondence, relating U(N) Chern-Simons theory at large N to topological strings, {{in the context}} of spherical Seifert 3 -manifolds. These are quotients S^Γ = ΓS^ 3 of the three-sphere by the free action of a finite isometry group. <b>Guided</b> by <b>string</b> theory dualities, we propose a large N dual description in terms of both A- and B-twisted topological strings on (in general non-toric) local Calabi-Yau threefolds. The target space of the B-model theory is obtained from the spectral curve of Toda-type integrable systems constructed on the double Bruhat cells of the simply-laced group identified by the ADE label of Γ. Its mirror A-model theory is realized as the local Gromov-Witten theory of suitable ALE fibrations on P^ 1, generalizing the results known for lens spaces. We propose an explicit construction of the family of target manifolds relevant for the correspondence, which we verify through a large N analysis of the matrix model that expresses the contribution of the trivial flat connection to the Chern-Simons partition function. Mathematically, our results put forward an identification between the 1 /N expansion of the sl_N + 1 LMO invariant of S^Γ and a suitably restricted Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas partition function on the A-model dual Calabi-Yau. This 1 /N expansion, {{as well as that of}} suitable generating series of perturbative quantum invariants of fiber knots in S^Γ, is computed by the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.

40|$|We {{consider}} two elementary {{forms of}} <b>string</b> rewriting called <b>guided</b> insertion/deletion and guided rewriting. The original strings are modified {{depending on the}} match with a given set of auxiliary <b>strings,</b> called <b>guides.</b> Guided insertion/deletion considers matching of a <b>string</b> and a <b>guide</b> {{with respect to a}} specific correspondence of <b>strings.</b> <b>Guided</b> rewriting considers matching of a <b>string</b> and a <b>guide</b> with respect to an equivalence relation on the alphabet. Guided insertion/deletion is inspired by {RNA}-editing, a biological process by which the original genetic information stored in DNA is modified before its final expression. The formalism here allows for simultaneous insertion and deletion of <b>string</b> elements. <b>Guided</b> rewriting, based on a letter-to-letter relation, is technically more appealing than guided insertion/deletion. We prove that guided rewriting preserves regularity: for every regular language its closure under guided rewriting is regular too. In the proof we will rely on the auxiliary notion of a slice sequence. We establish a correspondence of slice sequences and guide rewrite sequences. Because of their left-to-right nature, slice sequences are more convenient to deal with than guided rewrite sequences {{in the construction of the}} finite automata that we encounter in the proofs of regularity.
