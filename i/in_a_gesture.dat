5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, {{which is a very}} popular theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|The {{independence}} of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into Central Asia, thus enabling {{the completion of a}} multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region) during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.|$|E

5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|The party {{reached the}} capital of Liaodong on July 2, left four days later on July 6, and on July 12 Choe's party finally crossed the Yalu River and entered Joseon Korea. While the Grand Canal had its post stations, canal locks, ramps, moles, and paved towpaths, the land route from Beijing to the Yalu River was less {{elaborate}} but still featured the necessary distance markers and walled stations. Within a month of Choe's return to Korea, the Joseon court under King Seongjong (r. 1469–1494) sent an embassy to the Ming court of China <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of thanks for the Ming court's cordial treatment of Choe and his crew and providing safe travel for them.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Sheaffe and {{his staff}} decided to entrust the funeral {{arrangements}} to Captain John Glegg, who had served with Brock for many years. On 16 October, a funeral procession for Brock and Colonel Macdonell went from Government House to Fort George, with soldiers from the British Army, the colonial militia, and First Nations warriors {{on either side of}} the route. The caskets were lowered into a freshly dug grave at the northeast corner of Fort George. The British fired a twenty-one gun salute in three salvos, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of respect. Later that day, the American garrison at Fort Niagara respectfully fired a similar salute. Over five thousand people attended the funeral, a remarkable number given the limited population of Upper Canada at that time.|$|E

5|$|Amid the {{euphoria}} generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously {{to enter into a}} union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E

25|$|The most {{remarkable}} feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social simbols, religious simbols, images of posthumous kolo, figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly simbolic, geometrical, or damaged). Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; spirals, arcades, rosettes, vine leaves and grapes, lilium, stars (often six-pointed) and crescent Moons {{are among the}} images that appear. Figural images include processions of deer, horse, dancing the kolo, hunting, chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, {{the image of the}} man with his right hand raised, perhaps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of fealty.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{improvisation}} {{of the film}} occurs when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000, money Cal earned by speculating in beans before the US became involved in World War I. Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of extreme emotion, lunged forward and grabbed him in a full embrace, crying. Kazan kept this and Massey's shocked reaction in the film. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause. Both characters are angst-ridden protagonists and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving approval from their fathers.|$|E
25|$|Later, Hank {{is invited}} to the Whites' home, where he unintentionally stumbles upon one of Walter's books with a signed message from Gale Boetticher. He realizes that Walter is the infamous Heisenberg and {{secretly}} restarts the investigation. Hank forms an alliance with Jesse, who now despises Walter for all his wrongdoings. Left with no options, Walter buries {{the money in the}} To'hajilee desert and hires Jack again to murder Jesse. Walter attempts to confront Jesse in the desert, but instead Hank traps and arrests him. Welker's gang arrives and engages Hank in a fierce firefight. Jack executes Hank despite Walter's pleas. Jesse is captured and forced into slavery, producing meth for the gang. Before leaving, Jack and his gang take a majority of Walter's money, leaving him with $11 million <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of good will.|$|E
