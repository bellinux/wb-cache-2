5|$|The Act {{created a}} new offence for {{publishing}} obscene material, repealing the common law offence of obscene libel which was previously used, and also allows Justices of the Peace to issue warrants allowing the police to seize such materials. At {{the same time it}} creates two defences; firstly, the defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination,</b> and secondly the defence of public good. The Act has been used in several high-profile cases, such as the trials of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover and Oz for the Schoolkids OZ issue.|$|E

50|$|Where a {{defamatory}} statement is found, a service provider may avail {{themselves to a}} defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> - {{as set out in}} the English case of Vizetelly v. Mudie’s Select Library Ltd., 1900 2 Q.B. 17.|$|E
50|$|The defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> {{has been}} {{extended}} to printers in England by virtue of s.1 of the Defamation Act 1996. However, the Act {{made clear that the}} defence is not available to the author, editor or commercial publisher of the defamatory material.|$|E
5000|$|In Vizetelly v. Mudie's Select Library, a {{circulating}} library provided to subscribers {{a book on}} Stanley's search for Emir Pasha in Africa, {{which turned out to}} be defamatory. The issue was whether the library can claim protection under <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Lord Justice Romer described the defence as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> is {{a defense}} {{available}} when a defendant had no actual {{knowledge of the}} defamatory statement or {{no reason to believe}} the statement was defamatory. Thus, a delivery service cannot be held liable for delivering a sealed defamatory letter. The defense can be defeated if the lack of knowledge was due to negligence.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{everyone}} involved in the dissemination of the defamation is liable as having published it. But it has been held that some forms of distribution are so mechanical that the actor {{ought not to be}} held liable unless he/she ought to have realized that there was defamation involved. The defence is known as <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> or mechanical distributor.|$|E
50|$|Once a claim {{has been}} made out the {{defendant}} may avail him or herself to a defense of justification (the truth), fair comment, responsible communication, or privilege. Publishers of defamatory comments may also use the defense of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> where they {{had no knowledge of}} the nature of the statement, it was not brought to their attention, and they were not negligent.|$|E
5000|$|A {{person who}} is found to have {{published}} a defamatory statement may evoke a defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination,</b> which absolves him/her of liability provided that he/she {{had no knowledge of}} the defamatory nature of the statement, and that his/her failure to detect the defamatory content was not due to negligence. The defence, sometimes also known as [...] "mechanical distributor", is of concern to Internet Service Providers because of their potential liability for defamatory material posted by their subscribers.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{rule is that}} {{everyone}} involved in any way in the production or dissemination of defamatory material is liable as having published it. This is because defamation is a tort of strict liability. It can be committed unwittingly by reason {{of the existence of}} facts and circumstances unknown to the publisher of the defamatory statement. However, some forms of distribution or dissemination are so mechanical that a distributor ought not to be held liable unless he/she ought to have known there was defamation involved. Therefore, a defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> is conceived ...|$|E
5000|$|Eady J {{went on to}} {{distinguish}} Godfrey as a case of continued publication of the same defamatory statements after receipt of the plaintiff's request of removal. Bunt was different because the claimant was relying on separate postings. His Lordship further remarked that the position of an ISP is not analogous {{to that of a}} distributor. While a distributor may need to prove an absence of negligence to establish a defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination,</b> his Lordship said persons who truly fulfil no more than the role of a passive medium for communication, such as ISPs, cannot be characterized as publishers and hence [...] "do not need a defence".|$|E
50|$|In Hemming v Newton, Hemming sued Newton for libel and {{defamation}} as {{a result}} of a posting and a story on a P2P website which was owned and moderated by Newton. The author of the posting was unknown, but Newton was the author of the story. Newton's statements of defence alleged he was an innocent disseminator as he did not see or authorize the posting before it occurred and removed it in good faith upon receipt of Hemming’s complaint. Hemming asserted that it would be an abuse of process for Newton's defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> to stand. The judge held that Newton had pleaded sufficient facts to enable Hemming to know why he contends he was an innocent disseminator, and refused to strike out the defence.|$|E
5000|$|Crookes v. Openpolitics.ca, filed May 2006 Supreme Court of BC, and {{a series}} of related suits leading to a {{unanimous}} October 2011 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in Crookes v. Newton upholding the rights of online debaters to link freely to third parties without fear of liability for contents {{at the other end of}} the link. A number of related rulings had previously established that transient comments on the Internet could not be, in themselves, simply printed and used to prove that [...] "publication" [...] had occurred for purposes of libel and defamation law in Canada. Other elements of the ruling clarified how responsible journalism (and therefore the right to protect anonymous sources), qualified privilege and <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> defenses applied to persons accused of online defamation.|$|E
50|$|As is {{the case}} for most Commonwealth jurisdictions, Canada follows English law on {{defamation}} issues (except in Quebec where the private law is derived from French civil law). In common law, defamation covers any communication that tends to lower the esteem of the subject in the minds of ordinary members of the public. Probably true statements are not excluded, nor are political opinions. Intent is always presumed, and {{it is not necessary to}} prove that the defendant intended to defame. In Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto (1995), the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the actual malice test adopted in the US case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. Once a claim has been made, the defendant may avail themselves of a defense of justification (the truth), fair comment, responsible communication, or privilege. Publishers of defamatory comments may also use the defense of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> where they had no knowledge of the nature of the statement, it was not brought to their attention, and they were not negligent.|$|E
50|$|The Obscene Publications Bill {{was first}} put before the UK Parliament in 1955 {{as a private}} member's bill on the {{recommendation}} of the Herbert Committee in response to what was seen as the failure of the existing common law offense of obscene libel. The Bill’s sponsor Roy Jenkins cited five prosecutions in 1954 which highlighted the uncertainty of the law on obscenity and that the basis of the existing law, R v Hicklin, had the effect of a stringent literary censorship. Consequently, the resultant Act made specific provision for a defence of public good, broadly defined as a work of artistic or scientific merit, intended to exclude literature from the scope of the law while still permitting the prosecution of pornography or such works which would under section 2 of the Act ”tend to deprave and corrupt persons likely to read it”. The Act also required the court to consider the work as a whole, put a time limit on prosecutions, provided booksellers with a defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination,</b> gave publishers a right of defence against a destruction order, provided the right of appeal, and limited the penalty of conviction. The Act came into force on 30 August 1959.|$|E
5000|$|In Hong Kong, a {{statutory}} defence of {{unintentional defamation}} exists in section 25 of the Defamation Ordinance (Cap. 21), but {{differs from the}} statutory <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> defence in the UK Defamation Act 1996 {{in the sense that}} under the Defamation Ordinance a defence is not specified for a party who is involved in electronic publications. Under the Defamation Ordinance, if a defendant claims that the words in dispute were innocently published, it may make an [...] "offer of amend", which is an offer to publish a correction of the offending words and a sufficient apology to the plaintiff. If the offer of amends is accepted by the plaintiff and is duly performed, the proceedings cannot be taken or continued against the person who made the offer, but can be possibly taken against the author. Section 25(5) of the Ordinance stipulates that the publication will be treated as innocent if (a) that the publisher did not intend to publish the words of and concerning that other person, and did not know of circumstances by virtue of which they might be understood to refer to him; or (b) that the words were not defamatory on the face of them, and the publisher exercised all reasonable care in relation to the publication. In either case, all [...] "reasonable care" [...] must be exercised by the publisher in relation to the publication.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to simplify the}} liability of online intermediaries as publishers of third party defamatory content that they host. It proposes that due to two significant gaps in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015, the law of defamation must be reformed to provide predictable outcomes for intermediaries. The author offers solutions under two headings: the period before an intermediary has knowledge of third party content; and the period after which the intermediary becomes aware of its existence. For the former, this paper proposes that the <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination</b> defence is reformed to apply to online intermediaries. For the latter, the author asserts that personal and commercial operators should be held to different knowledge standards leading to liability, based on traditional defamation principles. Furthermore, this paper assesses the control that an intermediary might exercise over their content, and {{attempts to}} reconcile this with a knowledge-based approach. It also introduces the principle of severance, which European Union and United Kingdom case law apply to define precisely the content for which the intermediary is liable. Lastly, this paper examines how reform {{has worked in the}} United Kingdom, before proposing statutory reform to the Defamation Act 1992 in Appendix A...|$|E
40|$|Defamation {{has been}} a fertile ground of {{litigation}} and has never failed to present new challenges to the courts in different jurisdictions in the Internet age. In 2013, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (Hong Kong) finally {{had a chance to}} decide on the liability of online service providers in the case of Oriental Press Group Ltd. v. Fevaworks Solutions Ltd. The highest court in Hong Kong confirmed the decisions of the lower courts and ruled that a provider of online discussion forum has to bear legal liabilities for defamatory remarks posted by third parties,and therefore, when it has received notification from the complainant it has a duty to remove the concerned remarks within reasonable time. Seemingly, this approach on liability is in line with the legal positions in other jurisdictions which are based largely on a notice and take down regime. However, a careful analysis of the Feva judgment reveals that the Hong Kong court reaches this conclusion through an extension of common law principles in holding online intermediaries of discussion forum as ‘secondary publishers’ with liabilities being imposed from the outset, but provided with the defence of <b>innocent</b> <b>dissemination.</b> This article explains why this interpretation of common law is unsatisfactory, and argues that a statutory solution will provide a better answer to solve the conundrum on online intermediaries’ liabilities in defamation disputes...|$|E
