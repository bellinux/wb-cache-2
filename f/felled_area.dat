40|$|In Australia the use {{of forest}} biomass has been {{developing}} {{in recent years and}} initial efforts are built on adopting and trialling imported European technology. Using a linear programming-based tool, BIOPLAN, this study investigated the impact of five operational factors: energy demand, moisture content, interest rate, transport distance, and truck payload on total forest residues supply chain cost in Western Australia. The supply chain consisted four phases: extraction of residues from the clear <b>felled</b> <b>area</b> to road side by forwarders, storage at road side, chipping of materials by mobile chippers, and transport of chips to an energy plant. For an average monthly energy demand of 3600 GJ, the minimum wood supply chain cost was about $ 33. 9 /m 3, which is acceptable target supply cost for economically viable bioenergy production in Australia. By increasing the monthly energy demand from 3600 GJ to 43200 GJ, the total cost of the supply chain increased from $ 179, 087 to $ 2, 149, 043. For higher interest rates, the total storage cost increased which resulted in larger operational cost per m 3. Longer transport distances and lower truck payloads resulted in higher transport cost per unit of delivered chips. In addition, the highest supply chain costs occurred when moisture content ranged between 20 % and 30 %...|$|E

The objective of this study is to get clear picture on the cost components of forest concession and to know the stumpage value of forest land. To determine the stumpage value a production cost analysis was done based on a year operation of concession holder. The results showed that the cost components of log production consists of planning, building main road and skidding road, road maintenance and log houling with total production cost Rp. 58. 480,- per m 3 for <b>felled</b> <b>area</b> of 1000 ha with production of meranti and mixed species each 22. 003, 47 m 3 and 7. 720, 78 m 3, respectively.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) including terpenoids are emitted {{into the atmosphere}} from various natural sources. Damaging the plant tissue is known to strongly increase their monoterpene release. We measured the terpenoid emissions caused by timber felling, i. e. those from stumps and logging residue. The emissions from stumps were studied using enclosures and those from the whole <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> using an ecosystem scale micrometeorological method, disjunct eddy accumulation (DEA). The compounds analyzed were isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Strong emissions of monoterpenes were measured from both the stumps and from the whole <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> The emission rate fell down rapidly within {{few months after the}} logging. In addition to fresh logging residue, the results suggest also other strong monoterpene sources to be present at the <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> Those could include pre-existing litter, increased microbial activity and remaining undergrowth.

40|$|Background: The 27 {{countries}} in the European Union have a combined total of 177 million ha of forested and other wooded land. These are mainly characterised as semi-natural, multi-functional forests. Only about 13 million ha are characterised as plantationsi, although an additional 47 million ha are regarded as planted forests (Forest Europe 2011). European forests are highly diverse due to centuries of management in countries with different cultural objectives. Often the current management is nature oriented and so forests {{may not be used}} primarily for wood production. Wood provides {{only a small part of}} the income for many of the 16 million private owners according to the Confédération Européenne des Propriétaires Forestiers (CEPF 2013). These circumstances, plus sluggish demand for wood brought about by the current economic crisis, have generated challenges for the forestry sector. Demand for wood is expected to increase with expansion of the green economy and an increased emphasis on the use of bioenergy. Methods: Three forest management scenarios (analysed with the EFISCEN model) were used to project supply in response to demand for wood from EU forests over the next 50 years. Results: Shortening of broadleaved forest rotation length and planting 50 % of the <b>felled</b> <b>area</b> with fast-growing coniferous species could increase coniferous wood supply from 473 to 561 million m 3 y- 1.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the tree community of a fragment of tropical semideciduous forest was investigated in south-eastern Brazil. Surveys were carried out in 2000 and 2005 in 29 20 × 20 m plots. The main purpose {{was to assess the}} possibility of detecting spatial patterns of dynamics that could be related to the heterogeneity of both the environment and disturbance history in a small forest area (4. 0 ha). Rates of mortality and recruitment of trees and gain and loss of basal area were obtained for the whole sample, four pre-defined soil habitats, diameter classes and twelve tree populations. The tree community was rather unstable in the period, once mortality rates surpassed recruitment rates and loss rates of basal area surpassed gain rates all-over the area denoting the prevalence of a degradation process, possibly triggered by a clear felling in 1985 that reduced the area of the fragment in 26 %. The tree community dynamics showed no spatial autocorrelation but was not evenly distributed throughout the fragment. This spatial heterogeneity was chiefly determined by the disturbance history of each site while environmental heterogeneity played a secondary but significant role. The main causes of disturbance heterogeneity were the extension of the adjacent <b>felled</b> <b>area,</b> cattle trampling and selective logging.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate why there is damage to the ground when working with the slash in forest management from the forest officer point of view. A self-designed questionnaire was used and 45 questionnaires were sent out to various companies all over Sweden. Of these, 25 answered the questions, with a shortfall of 44 %. The question if there are to few educations possibilities, 8 % fully agreed and 80 partly agreed that it was too little education. Of these 33 % thought that education paid off afterwards. The issue of follow-up 13 % found it sufficient and 52 % said it was not enough follow-ups. It was 67 % who had no onsite review where soil loss has occurred, but all 67 % would consider introducing onsite review. There are communication gaps between the entrepreneur and employees (45 %) but not between the contractor and production managers (35 %). 25 % find it sufficient and 63 % partially agree that it should be more means in the forest such as bridges. On the issue of planned head roads, 45 % think it is a solution, while no one is completely against. About ground disturbance and slash in the future, 92 % believe that ground damages will not prevent the levying of slash. The belief in slash is strong and 67 % believe completely in slash whatever ground damages will occur. Lack of education, follow-ups and communication about ground damages in slash-jack may be possible explanations why there are damage on the ground. Better planning and greater use of supporting devices may be ways to reduce ground damages in the future.

40|$|The ontogenetic {{properties}} of moesian beech seedlings were analysed {{in the first}} vegetation growth period at identical sites, but in different stand conditions based on the divergent values of unique and complex biological characteristics. The seedlings were formed on the deluvium {{at the site of}} montane beech forests (Fagetum moesiacae montanum typicum Jov. 1976) on deep eutric brown soil. The terrain is gently sloped, exposure east-southeast, altitude about 470 m The seedlings from the completely closed part of the stand are the phenotype of the sciomorphic structural form. Their above-ground shoots usually consist of: hypocotyl, cotyledons (or their scars), above-cotyledon internode-epicotyl, a weak (leafless, as a rule), sylleptically formed "above-epicotyl axis", two opposite, primary, leaves and vegetative buds, large terminal and undeveloped in the axyl cotyledons and primary leaves Compared to the conditions in the closed canopy, seedlings on the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> differ in some biological properties and form a different phenotype In the different environment conditions, the greater significance of differences between identical biological properties is expressed according to the order of their origin.

40|$|Commercial {{coniferous}} plantations {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} poor habitats for bats. As a result, the impact of forest management practices on bats, such as clear felling, has received little attention, particularly in Europe. However, there is growing evidence from multiple regions that bats do make use of plantation landscapes, and as interest in siting onshore wind turbines in upland conifer plantations grows, there is an urgent need to examine whether felling prior to turbine installation is likely to put foraging bats at risk of collision. In the first study of its kind, we use a “before – after – control – impact” study to explore the short-term impacts of clear fell harvest on bat activity in commercial plantations. Thirty-one mature stands of Sitka Spruce were surveyed using acoustic detectors in three large, upland Sitka Spruce plantations in Britain. Eleven stands were felled between 2013 and 2015, and 26 of the original 31 stands were resurveyed in 2015. The change in total bat activity and species- or genus-specific bat activity was modelled before and after felling occurred at both felled and control stands using generalised linear models. There was no change in overall bat activity at felled sites compared to control sites, but activity ofNyctalusspecies was 23 times higher following felling. TotalPipistrellus spp. activity doubled at felled sites post-harvesting, although this was mainly driven by increased activity at a few felled sites. WhenP. pygmaeusandP. pipistrelluswere considered separately, activity increased slightly but non-significantly. The size of the <b>felled</b> <b>area</b> influenced activity (for bats overall andPipistrellus spp.), with 90 % higher activity in smaller felled stands (less than 5 ha− 1) compared to larger felled stands (greater than 30 ha− 1). ForP. pipistrellus, activity in felled areas decreased with the duration since harvesting; the greatest activity occurred in stands felled within two months compared to those harvested more than 16 months previously. Higher activity for some groups following felling may occur due {{to the creation of}} more edge habitat, which is preferred by bothPipistrellusspecies we recorded. An increase in activity following the small-scale felling (‘key-holing’) required for the installation of turbines could put foraging bats at risk from collisions with turbines. Further investigation of the influence of both size of clear fell patch, timing of felling and changes in invertebrate abundance due to felling are required to establish the potential risk of key-holing and turbine installation to foraging bats...|$|E

A dinâmica da comunidade arbórea e de doze populações foi investigada em um fragmento de Floresta Semidecídua, com base em inventários conduzidos em 2000 e 2005 em 29 parcelas de 20 × 20 m. O objetivo principal foi verificar se seria possível detectar padrões de dinâmica relacionados à heterogeneidade ambiental de um fragmento florestal de área pequena (4, 0 ha). Foram obtidas taxas de mortalidade e recrutamento de árvores e taxas de ganho e perda de área basal para a amostra total, quatro habitats de solo previamente definidos, classes de diâmetro e populações. A comunidade arbórea mostrou-se instável no período, uma vez que as taxas de mortalidade superaram as de recrutamento e as taxas de perda superaram as de ganho em área basal tanto na amostra total como nos habitats de solo. Tais mudanças gerais se relacionaram, possivelmente, a uma fase de degradação do ciclo silvigenético provavelmente desencadeada por um severo episódio de distúrbio ocorrido no passado. A dinâmica da comunidade não foi homogênea em todo o fragmento, diferiu significativamente entre os habitats de solo. As variáveis ambientais que se correlacionaram mais fortemente com a variação das taxas de dinâmica foram aquelas vinculadas à disponibilidade de água, luz e nutrientes minerais.
