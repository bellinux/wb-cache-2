500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need to idle their engines to {{maintain}} climate control within the truck cab (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. <b>Engine</b> <b>idling</b> is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to idle their engines. The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver to idle the engine. IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and land line phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants. Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a normal}} {{operating}} temperature of [...] prior to the recall switching to a [...] thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator. This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent air pockets, as with many modern cars. Simply pouring coolant into the thermostat housing (on the engine) might leave an air bubble in the radiator, while adding coolant just to the radiator might leave an air bubble in the engine's coolant passages. Proper procedure (with <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> and the thermostat removed, filling the thermostat housing, popping the bubble out of the radiator by cracking open the radiator cap until coolant exits) must be followed {{in order to ensure}} an air-free cooling system.|$|E
2500|$|There were no {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to the collapse, but {{at least}} five people passed the dam within the hour prior without noticing anything unusual. The last, Ace Hopewell, a carpenter at Powerhouse , rode his motorcycle past the dam about ten minutes before midnight. He testified at the Coroner's Inquest that he had passed Powerhouse [...] without seeing anything there or at the dam that caused him concern. He went on to state that at approximately one and one-half miles (2.4km) upstream he heard above the roar of his motorcycle a rumbling much {{like the sound of}} [...] "rocks rolling on the hill." [...] He stopped and got off, leaving the <b>engine</b> <b>idling,</b> and smoked a cigarette while checking the hillside above him. The rumble that had caught his attention earlier had begun to fade behind him. Assuming that {{it may have been a}} landslide, as these were common in the area, and satisfied that he was in no danger, he continued on.|$|E

50|$|A bad crank {{position}} sensor can worsen {{the way the}} <b>engine</b> <b>idles,</b> or the acceleration behaviour. If the engine is revved up with a bad or faulty sensor, it may cause misfiring, motor vibration or backfires. Acceleration might be hesitant, and abnormal shaking during <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> might occur. In the worst case the car may not start.|$|R
5000|$|Idle speed (idling, or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion <b>engine).</b> The <b>idle</b> differs in two ways <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and vehicle idle. At <b>idle</b> speed, the <b>engine</b> generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car <b>engine,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle <b>engines,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|R

The discussion focuses on the test results of the key combustor modifications for both the simulated <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and cruise conditions. Several range-augmentation techniques are demonstrated that allow the lean-reaction premixed aircraft gas turbine combustor to operate with low NOx emissons at engine cruise and acceptable CO and UHC levels at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> These techniques involve several combinations, including variable geometry and fuel switching designs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the fuel {{consumption}} and emissions of automobile, the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speed control method was studied. The basic concept of <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speed and the requirements and strategies of idle speed control were introduced, and the features and structures of CAN bus technology were analyzed. An idle speed control system of automobile engine based on CAN bus was designed which included main control module, front control module and rear control module. The overall structure, hardware design and software implementation of the system were given. The system can realize the desired functions, and it has certain application value...|$|R

50|$|Ancillary {{benefits}} {{included a}} lowered <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> speed and increased fuel efficiency. SCL committed over 100 of its personnel to the conversion program. The first GP16 emerged from SCL's Uceta (Tampa) shop in June 1979 while the last was placed into service during November 1982.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} had {{an estimated}} lift-to-drag ratio of 37. [...] The aerodynamic drag {{is so low}} that, even with the <b>engine</b> <b>idling,</b> the aircraft can only descend at a maximum of 700 ft/min m/s. Twin drogue parachutes were used to slow the GlobalFlyer to landing speeds.|$|E
40|$|Three {{combustor}} concepts {{have been}} designed and tested to demonstrate significant reductions in aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> pollutant emissions. Each concept used a different approach for pollutant reductions: the Hot Wall Combustor employs a thermal barrier coating and impingement cooled liners, the Recuperative Cooling Combustor preheats the air before entering the combustion chamber, and the Catalytic Converter Combustor is composed of a conventional primary zone followed by a catalytic bed for pollutant cleanup. The designs are discussed in detail and test results are presented {{for a range of}} aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> conditions. The results indicate that ultra-low levels of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions can be achieved with this technology...|$|R

40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} in a CV- 990 jet transport with <b>engines</b> at <b>idle</b> power to investigate aircraft airframe noise. Test results showed that airframe noise was measured for the aircraft in the landing configuration. The results agreed well with the expected variation with the fifth power of velocity. For the aircraft in the clean configuraton, {{it was concluded that}} airframe noise was measured only at higher airspeeds with <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> noise present at lower speeds. The data show that landing gear and flaps make a significant contribution to airframe noise...|$|R
50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol <b>engines</b> at <b>idle.</b> In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see dieselisation).|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} {{a maze of}} {{emissions}} vacuum hoses. Because of the many vacuum-driven components and electrical connections in the system, CEC-equipped engines have developed a reputation of being hard to tune.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the cause of}} severe vibration problem of a coach with four-cylinder engine running at an idle state using vibration and impact hammer modal experiments to obtain the main vibration frequency components and the natural characteristics of the coach. The vibration {{results indicate that the}} main vibration component comes from the vibration transmitted from the engine to the chassis frame, which is closely related with the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speed. Based on structural simulation analysis of the coach’s chassis frame and comparison with modal testing, the coach severe vibration problem was due to coupling resonance between the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> frequency and the fourth natural frequency of the chassis frame. The solution to eliminate the vibration problem is provided by changing the local structure stiffness of the chassis frame. The contribution of this paper lies in providing a solution to solve similar problems...|$|R
50|$|Bleed screws are {{not common}} on cars today and are only {{necessary}} when {{design of a}} vehicle's cooling system results in areas where air can be trapped in the system.

50|$|An engine has {{one or more}} {{devices for}} {{converting}} energy it produces into a usable form, electricity connection through the alternator, hydraulic connections from a pump or engine system, compressed air, and engine vacuum; or the engine may be directly tapped through a mechanical connection. Modern vehicles run most accessories on electrical power. Typically, only 2% of a vehicle's total power output has gone towards powering accessories. Electrical and hybrid vehicles may use {{a larger proportion of}} energy for accessories, due to reduced inefficiencies in the drive train, especially the elimination of <b>engine</b> <b>idling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{initially}} produced, {{the vehicle}} {{was equipped with}} a [...] gasoline-powered Mopar engine. This proved to be too powerful, leading to speeding incidents and accidents. It also proved to be too prone to overheating. In practice the vehicle crew would spend many hours parked with the <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> and the air conditioning on. This was especially true during the long hot days of the short northern plains summers (sundown at Minot AFB in North Dakota is between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm during the summer) where most of Strategic Air Command's ICBM bases and several of its bomber bases were located. As the 360-cubic-inch Mopars failed, they were replaced with [...] gasoline-powered Mopars, though a few vehicles did receive diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|With {{a normal}} {{operating}} temperature of 220 F prior to the recall switching to a 195 F thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator.

50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter. During <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the aspirator valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of reducing frame vibrations in automotive vehicles with controlled hydraulic engine mounts is investigated. Only <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> situations are considered. Two modes of control are studied: semi-active and active. A dynamic model is {{developed for the}} semi-active hydraulic mount. The model is verified experimentally through impedance measurements. Sensitivity studies reveal the effectiveness of various parameter control schemes. Experimental implementation of the semi-active hydraulic mounts on a commercial vehicle confirm their ability to reduce frame vibration levels at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speeds. A simplified vehicle system model is used to investigate frame vibration control with active engine mounts. Closed-loop control designs using variations of the LQG control design method are evaluated through simulations.

The GSA method {{is applied to the}} application problem. Improved LQG control performance is achieved with the GSA method. ...|$|R
40|$|Inventories of {{particulate}} matter (PM) emissions from civil aviation and air quality models {{need to be}} validated using up-to-date measurement data corrected for sampling artifacts. We compared the measured black carbon (BC) mass and the total PM mass determined from particle size distributions (PSD) and effective density for a commercial turbofan engine CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3. The effective density was then {{used to calculate the}} PM mass losses in the sampling system. The effective density was determined using a differential mobility analyzer and a centrifugal particle mass analyzer, and increased from <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> to take-off by up to 60 %. The determined mass-mobility exponents ranged from 2. 37 to 2. 64. The mean effective density determined by weighting the effective density distributions by PM volume was within 10 % of the unit density (1000 kg/m 3) that is widely assumed in aircraft PM studies. We found ratios close to unity between the PM mass determined by the integrated PSD method and the real-time BC mass measurements. The integrated PSD method achieved higher precision at ultra-low PM concentrations at which current mass instruments reach their detection limit. The line loss model predicted ~ 60 % PM mass loss at <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> decreasing to ~ 27 % at high thrust. Replacing the effective density distributions with unit density lead to comparable estimates that were within 20 % and 5 % at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and high thrust, respectively. These results could be used {{for the development of a}} robust method for sampling loss correction of the future PM emissions database from commercial aircraft engines.
