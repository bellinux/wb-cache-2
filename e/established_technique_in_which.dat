50|$|The {{development}} of novel chemical means of incorporating phosphomimetics into proteins has provided important {{insight into the}} effects of phosphorylation events. Historically, phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site (serine, threonine or tyrosine) to an amino acid, such as alanine, that cannot be phosphorylated. While this approach {{has been successful in}} some cases, mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability. Thus, chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation. By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous phosphonate mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations. Protein semisynthesis, or more specifically expressed protein ligation (EPL), has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the C- or the N-terminus. In addition, researchers have built upon an <b>established</b> <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic tRNA that recognizes a nonsense codon with an unnatural amino acid. Recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo, although, due to permeability issues, these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible.|$|E

40|$|Mating and {{immunity}} are {{two major}} components of fitness and links between them have been demonstrated {{in a number of}} recent investigations. In Drosophila melanogaster, a seminal fluid protein, sex-peptide (SP), up-regulates a number of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes in females after mating but the resulting effect on pathogen resistance is unclear. In this study, we tested (1) whether SP-induced changes in gene expression affect the ability of females to kill injected non-pathogenic bacteria and (2) how the injection process per se affects the expression of AMP genes relative to SP. The ability of virgin females and females mated to SP lacking or control males to clear bacteria was assayed using an <b>established</b> <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Escherichia coli are injected directly into the fly body and the rate of clearance of the injected bacteria is determined. We found no repeatable differences in clearance rates between virgin females and females mated to SP producing or SP lacking males. However, we found that the piercing of the integument, as occurs during injection, up-regulates AMP gene expression much more strongly than SP. Thus, assays that involve piercing, which are commonly used in immunity studies, can mask more subtle and biologically relevant changes in immunity, such as those induced by mating...|$|E

Polystyrene sulfonate spheres were coated with alternating layers of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) in one system, and PAA – polyethyleneimine (PEI) in another system. Zeta potential and FTIR {{were used to}} monitor the deposition of each layer. The spheres were tested as a suitable platform for biosensor fabrication using two different model enzyme systems. The enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were separately immobilized {{onto the surface of}} the polymer spheres by electrostatic forces. Inhibition tests using the pesticide paraoxon were carried out on the AChE based biosensors. Both PE systems exhibited a paraoxon detection limit of 4. 6 × 10 − 8 M. The PAH-PAH system retained 50 % of original activity after 12 weeks, while the PEI-PAA system showed 40 % stability after 9 weeks. The PAH-PAA electrodes coated with immobilized HRP exhibited a hydrogen peroxide detection limit of 3. 5 × 10 − 6 M with 87 % retention after 10 weeks, compared to 9 × 10 − 7 M for PEI-PAA spheres with 89 % retention after 3 weeks. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Dynamic Compaction {{is a well}} <b>established</b> ground {{improvement}} <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a heavy pounder is {{dropped from}} a significant height to improve the soil’s mechanical properties. The pounder impact creates waves that compact the soil; however these waves {{may also be a}} nuisance to and damage neighbouring structures and facilities. Peak particle velocity (PPV) has been identified as the most suitable parameter for assessing vibration associated risks. Previous researchers have proposed a number different equations for predicting PPV. Dynamic Compaction has recently been used for soil improvement in Oman’s Blue City Project. Particle velocities and vibration frequencies in three directions have been monitored at several distances during the different phases of ground treatment. In all phases PPV has been recorded to be in the radial direction. It has been observed that although it appears that vibration frequency is not influenced by the deep compaction phase, does increase with the progression of work and application of later phases of Dynamic Compaction. This increase is more pronounced at farther distances, but becomes negligible when impact point is closer than a critical distance...|$|R
40|$|Background In adult live donor liver transplantation, {{postoperative}} {{venous congestion}} of graft and remnant livers {{can lead to}} life-threatening complications. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the safety and benefits of our 3 -dimensional, computed tomographic, computer-assisted donor hepatectomy using the "carving" partitioning technique. Methods Eighty-three consecutive adult live donor liver transplantations were performed based on data obtained from individualized preoperative 3 -dimensional, computed tomographic reconstructions and virtual graft hepatectomies. Results There were 71 right and 12 left grafts. Small grafts (graft volume body weight ratio, < 1. 0) were used in 20 cases. We observed no clinically important differences in postoperative function between right and left grafts. Four recipients developed lethal small-for-size syndrome. Reversible small-for-size syndrome was observed in a right graft recipient and in 2 right graft donors. Conclusion Preoperative 3 -dimensional, computed tomographic, computer-assisted planning using virtual liver partitioning allowed for: (1) an individualized carving technique based on specific donor anatomic characteristics, (2) donor safety based on individualized patterns of venous outflow, and (3) optimized drainage of the medial area of the graft based on the preferential inclusion of the middle hepatic vein. Hepatic venous outflow is of equal or even greater importance than portal inflow in assuring optimal graft outcome in cases of adult live donor liver transplantation (ALDLT). Impaired outflow in cases of small grafts in recipients with prominent portal hypertension can turn an otherwise controllable, small-for-size (SFS) situation into lethal graft failure. Venous outflow of the grafts can be optimized by inclusion of the middle hepatic vein (MHV). In the case of right grafts, this approach carries the potential risk of liver failure in the donor remnant liver secondary to venous congestion of the medial sector, which is drained by the detached MHV 4 A and 4 B tributaries. Our experience (inclusive of a learning curve) led us to <b>establish</b> the "carving" <b>technique,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the donor MHV is procured with the graft. As opposed to the standard Pringle/Cantlie line division that entails the detachment of tributaries from the MHV trunk, our "carving" technique transects small branches exactly at the MHV trunk. The preservation of subterritorial microveins seems to provide marginal zones with "bridge" drainage from the time of resection to the spontaneous opening of venous shunts into the left hepatic vein (LHV) or right hepatic vein (RHV). The aims of the present study were (1) to provide a step-by-step description of the "carving" liver parenchyma transection technique based on donor-individualized, 3 -dimensional, computed tomographic, computer-assisted surgery planning (3 D-CASP) and (2) to evaluate the outcomes of this technique...|$|R
