The definitive version is available at: [URL] {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of using an electrical heating garment during a 30 -minute recovery period after a standardized swimming warm-up on subsequent swimming performance and upper-body power output. On two occasions, eight male and four female elite competitive swimmers completed a standardized swimming warm-up, followed by a 30 -minute passive recovery period before completing maximal plyometric press-ups and a 50 m Freestyle swim. Plyometric press-ups determined starting strength (SS), peak force (PF) and peak concentric power (PCP). During the recovery period, participants wore tracksuit bottoms and (i) a standard tracksuit top (CON) or (ii) jacket with integrated electric heating elements (HEAT). The overall results demonstrated a trend of a relevant (> 0. 4 %) improvement in the 50 m Freestyle performance of 0. 83 % (P = 0. 06) in HEAT vs. CON. In male participants, performance in the 50 m Freestyle significantly improved by 1. 01 % (CON 25. 18 ± 0. 5 s vs. HEAT 24. 93 ± 0. 4 s; P < 0. 05), whereas female participants only showed a trend for an improvement of 0. 38 % (29. 18 ± 0. 5 s vs. 29. 03 ± 1. 0 s; P = 0. 09), in HEAT compared with CON, though statistical power for the latter test was low. Male participants’ starting strength, peak force and peak concentric power were 16. 5 ± 13 %, 18. 1 ± 21 % and 16. 2 ± 21 % greater, respectively, in HEAT compared with CON (all P< 0. 01). In conclusion, external heating of the upper body between completion of the warm-up and performance through the utilization of an electrically <b>heated</b> <b>jacket</b> improves plyometric press-up power output and force production, as well as sprint swimming performance in males. This provides justification for future enhancement opportunities in sporting performance through the utilization of external heating systems.

40|$|Ion Chromatography (IC) is the {{principal}} analytical method used to support studies of Sludge Reciept and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) chemistry at DWPF. A series of prior analytical ''Round Robin'' (RR) studies included both supernate and sludge samples from SRAT simulant, previously reported as memos, are tabulated in this report. 2, 3 From these studies it was determined to standardize IC column size to 4 mm diameter, eliminating the capillary column from use. As a follow on test, the DWPF laboratory, the PSAL laboratory, and the AD laboratory participated in the current analytical RR to determine a suite of anions in SRAT simulant by IC, results also are tabulated in this report. The particular goal was to confirm the laboratories ability to measure and quantitate glycolate ion. The target was + or - 20 % inter-lab agreement of the analyte averages for the RR. Each of the three laboratories analyzed a batch of 12 samples. For each laboratory, the percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) of the averages on nitrate, glycolate, and oxalate, was 10 % or less. The three laboratories all met the goal of 20 % relative agreement for nitrate and glycolate. For oxalate, the PSAL laboratory reported an average value that was 20 % {{higher than the average}} values reported by the DWPF laboratory and the AD laboratory. Because of this wider window of agreement, it was concluded to continue the practice of an additional acid digestion for total oxalate measurement. It {{should also be noted that}} large amounts of glycolate in the SRAT samples will have an impact on detection limits of near eluting peaks, namely Fluoride and Formate. A suite of scoping experiments are presented in the report to identify and isolate other potential interlaboratory disceprancies. Specific ion chromatography inter-laboratory method conditions and differences are tabulated. Most differences were minor but there are some temperature control equipment differences that are significant leading to a recommendation of a <b>heated</b> <b>jacket</b> for analytical columns that are remoted for use in radiohoods. A suggested method improvement would be to implement column temperture control at a temperature slightly above ambient to avoid peak shifting due to temperature fluctuations. Temperature control in this manner would improve short and longer term peak retention time stability. An unknown peak was observed during the analysis of glycolic acid and SRAT simulant. The unknown peak was determined to best match diglycolic acid. The development of a method for acetate is summaraized, and no significant amount of acetate was observed in the SRAT products tested.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CDFA+MBE:CPIInternational audienceNowadays, a large {{range of}} acids are {{produced}} from biomass either through chemical or biochemical transformations. Levulinic acid (LevA) can be cost-effectively produced from lignocellulosic biomass via a simple acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process (Biofine technology [1]). The hydrogenation of LevA over supported metallic catalysts {{leads to the}} formation of g-valerolactone (GVL), 1, 4 -pentanediol (PenDO) and methytetrahydrofurane (MTHF). The selectivity depends {{on the nature of the}} metal and on the reaction conditions. While GVL was predominantly formed over monometallic catalysts, PenDO and MTHF were mainly produced over bimetallic Re-Ru catalysts [2]. Since partial leaching of Re was observed during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of succinic acid [3], different other promotors (Mo, Sn, W) were evaluated in the hydrogenation of LevA. Materials and MethodsBimetallic catalysts were prepared by successive impregnations of an active carbon (L 3 S CECA) with aqueous solutions of the metallic salts and reduction under H 2. Hydrogenation reactions were conducted in a 300 mL Hastelloy Parr 4560 autoclave equipped with an electrically <b>heated</b> <b>jacket,</b> a turbine stirrer with magnetic driver, and a liquid sample line. In a typical reaction, the reactor was loaded with 7. 5 g acid, 142 g water and 1 g catalyst. After purging with Ar, the reaction medium was heated to the desired temperature (typically 140 °C) and H 2 pressure (150 bar) was introduced to initiate the reaction. The liquid samples periodically withdrawn from the reactor were analyzed using both HPLC chromatography with UV and RID detections (ICSep Coregel 107 H column, 0. 005 N H 2 SO 4 as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0. 5 mL. min- 1) and gas chromatography (FFAP column, using He as carrier gas). Acids, lactones, diols, cyclic ethers and by-products (propionic, butyric and acetic acids, n-butanol, and n-propanol) could be quantified. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was also measured using a Shimadzu TOC-VCHS analyzer. Results and DiscussionRegardless the nature of the promotor, complete hydrogenation of LevA to GVL was observed within less than one hour. The reaction rate of the subsequent hydrogenation of GVL was highly dependent on the Ru/promoter ratio as well as on the nature of the promoter. In the presence of Sn-Ru/C, the hydrogenation of GVL was very slow; after 30 h only a 16 % PenDO yield was obtained. Similarly, modest reaction rate was achieved in the presence of W-Ru/C catalysts. Conversely, interesting results were observed in the presence of Mo-Ru/C catalysts (Figure 1). Using a Mo/Ru molar ratio in the range from 0. 26 up to 1. 8, it was shown that the higher the Mo/Ru ratio, the lower the reaction rate. However, the selectivity to PenDO was not affected and was as high as 75 - 80 %. Furthermore, no Mo leaching was detected during the reaction. Figure 1 : Evolution of the concentration of the products during the hydrogenation of LevA (not shown) over 0. 5 %Mo- 2 %Ru/C (dotted line) and 3. 2 %Re- 2. 5 %Ru/C (full line) Since formic acid is co-produced in equimolar amount as LevA during the industrial production of LevA, its presence in the feed was studied. Over both catalysts (Re and Mo promoted), a dramatic decrease in the reaction rate (together with hydrogenation of formic acid) was observed. However, the final selectivity to PenDO was unchanged. The higher stability of Mo-based catalysts compared to Re-based catalysts was confirmed...|$|E

Five different heat management scenarios are examined and compared to each other: a base case where the heat source for the dehydrogenation process is an external heater (external jacket) surrounding the tank. The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal hydride tank as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes. For the fourth scenario, the optimum number of the co-central tubes from the previous case is used in combination with interior extended surfaces (fins).

The technology used in this project {{is related to the}} use of biomass to produce a viable alternative to conventional sources of fuel. A bench scale biomass to liquid (BTL) facility was built and tested. This produced results confirming the feasibility of the BTL process. The findings of the pilot study outlined in this dissertation justified the conclusion that the next step will be to expand the capacity and productivity of the BTL pilot plant to an industrial scale. Biomass comes from a variety of renewable sources that are readily available. In this case, the material used in the fixed bed biomass gasification facility to generate wood gas was agricultural and forestry waste, such as straw and wood chips. The gasifier had the capacity to produce up to 10 cubic metres/hr of gas with a carbon monoxide and hydrogen content of between 20 – 40 % by volume, when it was operated at ambient pressure and with air as the oxidizer. The gas, produced at a temperature above 700 º C, was cooled in a quench/water scrubber in order to remove most of the mechanical impurities (tars and water-soluble inorganic particles), condensed and dried with corn cobs before being compressed in cylinders at over 100 bar (g) for use in the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). The syngas was subjected further to a series of refining processes which included removal of sulphur and oxygen. The sulphur removal technology chosen entailed applying modified activated carbon to adsorb H 2 S with the help of hydrolysis in order to convert organic sulphur impurities into H 2 S which reduced the sulphur content of the gas to less than 5 ppbv.
