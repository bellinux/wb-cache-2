5000|$|Development of the single-chip {{microprocessor}} was {{an enormous}} catalyst to the popularization of cheap, easy to use, and truly personal computers. The Altair 8800, introduced in a Popular Electronics magazine article in the January 1975 issue, at the time set a new low price point for a computer, bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the 1970s. This {{was followed by the}} IMSAI 8080 computer, with similar abilities and limitations. The Altair and IMSAI were essentially scaled-down minicomputers and were incomplete: to connect a keyboard or teleprinter to them required heavy, expensive [...] "peripherals". These machines both featured a front panel with switches and lights, which communicated with the operator in binary. To program the machine after switching it on the bootstrap loader program had to be entered, without error, in binary, then a paper tape containing a BASIC interpreter loaded from a paper-tape reader. <b>Keying</b> the <b>loader</b> required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the [...] "load" [...] button, once for each byte of the program, which was typically hundreds of bytes long. The computer could run BASIC programs once the interpreter had been loaded.|$|R

This paper {{presents}} {{solution of}} authentication problem for all components of information interoperabilityin {{process of operation}} system network loading on thin client from terminal server. System Definition. In the proposed solution operation system integrity check is made by hardware-software module, including USB-token with protected memory for secure storage of cryptographic <b>keys</b> and <b>loader.</b> The <b>key</b> requirement for the solution is mutual authentication of four participants: terminal server, thin client, token and user. We have created two algorithms for the problem solution. The first of the designed algorithms compares the encrypted one-time password (random number) with the reference value stored {{in the memory of}} the token and updates this number in case of successful authentication. The second algorithm uses the public and private keys of the token and the server. As a result of cryptographic transformation, participants are authenticated and the secure channel is formed between the token, thin client and terminal server. Main Results. Additional research was carried out {{to find out if the}} designed algorithms meet the necessary requirements. Criteria used included applicability in a multi-access terminal system architecture, potential threats evaluation and overall system security. According to analysis results, it is recommended to use the algorithm based on PKI due to its high scalability and usability. High level of data security is proved as a result of asymmetric cryptography application with the guarantee that participants' private keys are never sent in the authentication process. Practical Relevance. The designed PKI-based algorithm allows solving the problem with the use of cryptographic algorithms according to state standard even in its absence on asymmetric cryptography. Thus, it can be applied in the State Information Systems with increased requirements to information security...|$|R
50|$|Keying was {{accomplished}} by setting each switch in a matrix of switches to one of several positions. This was done using a separate mechanical <b>key</b> <b>loader</b> (KYK-28) that had a matching matrix of pins that could be set to different heights as instructed by a key list. The <b>key</b> <b>loader</b> was pushed into a matrix of holes, one hole for each switch. The loader also had two larger index pins that also cocked a spring that would return each switch to their initial position when the door covering the hole matrix was reopened, zeroizing the equipment.|$|E

It is intended to be the cryptographic engine for next generation key management devices, such as the AN/PYQ-10 <b>key</b> <b>loader,</b> as part of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s Cryptographic Modernization Initiative.

Unlike LMD/KP Tier 2 accounts, Tier 3 using entities never receive electronic key directly from a COR or Tier 0.|$|E
50|$|The AN/PYQ-10 Simple <b>Key</b> <b>Loader</b> (SKL) is a ruggedized, portable, {{hand-held}} fill device, for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data between compatible cryptographic {{and communications}} equipment. The SKL {{was designed and}} built by Ralph Osterhout and then sold to Sierra Nevada Corporation, with software developed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) {{under the auspices of}} the United States Army. It is intended to supplement and eventually replace the AN/CYZ-10 Data Transfer Device (DTD). The PYQ-10 provides all the functions currently resident in the CYZ-10 and incorporates new features that provide streamlined management of COMSEC key, Electronic Protection (EP) data, and Signal Operating Instructions (SOI). Cryptographic functions are performed by an embedded KOV-21 card developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). The AN/PYQ-10 supports both the DS-101 and DS-102 interfaces, as well as the KSD-64 Crypto Ignition Key. The SKL is backward-compatible with existing End Cryptographic Units (ECU) and forward-compatible with future security equipment and systems, including NSA's Key Management Infrastructure.|$|E
