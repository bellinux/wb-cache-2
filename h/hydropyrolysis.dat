Analytical pyrolysis {{is often used to}} thermally decompose macromolecular organic matter in an inert atmosphere into lower molecular weight fragments that are more amenable to conventional organic analytical techniques. <b>Hydropyrolysis</b> refers to pyrolysis assisted by high hydrogen gas pressures and a dispersed catalytically-active molybdenum sulfide phase. <b>Hydropyrolysis</b> of meteorites has not been attempted previously although it is ideally suited to such studies due to its relatively high yields. <b>Hydropyrolysis</b> of the Murchison macromolecular material successfully releases significant amounts of high molecular weight PAH including phenanthrene, carbazole, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, perylene, benzoperylene and coronene units with varying degrees of alklyation. Analysis of both the products and residue from <b>hydropyrolysis</b> reveals that the meteoritic organic network contains both labile (pyrolysable) and refractory (nonpyrolysable) fractions.

The chars were examined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersion analyser and by X-ray diffraction. The proportion of the combustible and non-combustible sulphur in the char has been determined. Hydrogen pressure promotes reaction with sulphur but the sulphur content of the chars increases from 3 to 4. 5 wt% when the temperature is increased from 616 to 845 °C. This increase in sulphur {{is a consequence of}} the reaction between hydrogen sulphide, produced during <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of coal, with the alkaline-earth mineral matter to produce alkaline-earth sulphide. The SEM and X-ray diffraction images show that in the char formed at 780 °C the sulphur, calcium and magnesium are localized in the same compounds.

40|$|Bio-oil from biomass through {{thermochemical}} conversion is not readily usable as fuel {{because of its}} extremely high oxygen content and relatively poor storage stability. Thus, fast pyrolysis to upgrade the quality of biomass is possible by means of thermochemical pathway through which pyrolysis oil is upgraded via hydroprocessing to motor-vehicle grade oil product. The catalytic treament of biomass under hydrogen pressure (i. e., <b>hydropyrolysis)</b> is an attractive route to obtainin high yield of liquid hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). The effect of catalyst is to convert oxygen in bio-oil to H 2 O, CO, and CO 2. The decrease in oxygen content contributes to a remarkable increase in the heating value of bio-oil. We have proposed in our research the utilization of nickel-loaded brown coal (Ni/LY) char as an alternative catalyst for upgrading the quality of bio-oil product. The Ni/LY char was prepared according to the ion-exchange method as it is inexpesive and {{there are reports that}} the metallic Ni disperses well on the support in Ni/LY char with large specific surface area. Loy Yang brown coal was used in the preparation of the catalyst because it contains carboxyl and phenol groups which can exchange ions with metals. In this study the effects of catalysts (Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite, and CoMo/Al 2 O 3) on product yield and composition of bio-oil were investigated. Then the catalytic behavior of Ni/LY char was examined and employed to obtain the bio-oil with relatively low oxygen content that can be used as liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. In chapter 2, pyrolysis of rice husk was carried out in fluidized bed reactor. The effect of different catalysts (i. e., Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite and CoMo/Al 2 O 3) was investigated. The results showed that a low molecular weight and low oxygen content of bio-oil are obtained with pyrolysis using catalyst. Catalysts supported the deoxygenation reaction by convert the oxygenated compounds of bio-oil to form H 2 O, CO 2 and CO. Best results are obtained with Ni/LY char and CoMo/Al 2 O 3 which can reduce the oxygen content of bio-oil from 33. 8 % without catalyst to 27. 6 and 24. 9 % with Ni/LY char and CoMo/Al 2 O 3, respectively. The decreasing of the oxygen content of bio-oil contributes to a remarkable increase in HHV. However, Ni/LY char is deemed more favorable than CoMo/Al 2 O 3 in term of the production cost of bio-oil. In chapter 3, <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of rice husk without catalyst was performed in a fluidized bed reactor. The effects of parameter conditions (i. e., hydrogen pressure, temperature, gas residence time (GRT), and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)) on product yields were studied to determine the optimal condition for bio-oil yield. The <b>hydropyrolysis</b> under 0. 1 MPa hydrogen gas produced bio-oil with relatively low oxygen content. The optimal <b>hydropyrolysis</b> temperature for the production of bio-oil from rice husk was found to be 500 °C and GRT of 2. 7 s. The high GHSV of 4891 h- 1 was found to be more favorable for the production of bio-oil due to the reduced residence time of vapors in bed material, maximizing the bio-oil yield at about 47. 1 wt. %. In chapter 4, <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of biomass materials (i. e., rice husk, coconut shell, and pine) was conducted in a fluidized bed reactor to evaluate bio-oil production. The <b>hydropyrolysis</b> was performed at 500 °C, GRT of 2. 7 s and GHSV of 4891 h- 1. The bio-oil yields from rice husk, pine, and coconut shell were 47. 1, 64. 5, and 52. 1 wt. %, respectively. The bio-oils were analyzed with an elemental analyzer, Karl-Fischer moisture titration, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that the bio-oils from all biomass have high oxygen content and oxygenated compounds such as phenols. The HHVs of bio-oils from pine and coconut shell are higher than that of rice husk due to their high carbon content, while rice husk has the lowest HHV, which can be ascribed to its low carbon content and high oxygen content. It is advisable that the bio-oil products be further processed to remove the condensed water and oxygen content for chemical and/or biofuel production. In chapter 5, <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of rice husk was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The effects of different catalysts, on the carbon conversion of rice husk and composition of bio-oils were studied. The experiments with catalysts under hydrogen atmosphere to produce bio-oils with much lower oxygen content were performed. The results show that the oxygen content of bio-oils is markedly reduced because the oxygenated hydrocarbons are hydrocracked resulting in the formation of H 2 O, CO and CO 2 when catalysts are introduced. The oxygen content of bio-oil under hydrogen atmosphere decreased from over 31. 1 % without catalyst to 25. 9 %, 20. 5 %, 26. 5 % and 10. 1 % with Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite and CoMo/Al 2 O 3, respectively. The use of CoMo/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/LY char under hydrogen atmosphere showed high activity to decrease the oxygen content, which leaded to a higher heating value and more aromatic hydrocarbons. These experiments indicated that catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> is suitable for producing bio-oils with lower molecular weight and high aromatic hydrocarbons which are possible to use as a potential liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. In chapter 6, catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of rice husk using Ni/LY char was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor {{in order to determine the}} bio-oil with the lowest oxygen content and investigate the effects of an inexpensive Ni/LY char activity, catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> temperature, and volume fraction of Ni/LY char on product yield and composition of bio-oils. These conditions were tested at the optimal condition (i. e., temperature of 500 °C, GRT of 2. 7 s and GHSV of 4891 h- 1). In the presence of Ni/LY char the oxygen content of bio-oil decreased by about 16 % compared with that of non-catalyst. Raising the temperature from 500 to 650 ºC reduced the oxygen content of bio-oil from 27. 5 % to 21. 5 %. The characteristics of bio-oil were analyzed by Karl Fischer, GC/MS, GPC, FT-IR, and CHN elemental analysis. The result indicated that <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of rice husk using Ni/LY char at temperature of 650 ºC produced bio-oil with relatively lower oxygen content, oxygenated compounds, high aromatic hydrocarbons, and high heating value. For the effect of volume fraction of Ni/LY char, which was investigated at the optimal condition for bio-oil yield, it was found that the oxygen content of bio-oils decreased, whereas the higher heating value of bio-oils increased when increasing the volume fraction of Ni/LY char. The bio-oil with the lowest oxygen content (20. 7 wt. %) and the highest heating value (30 MJ/kg) was obtained with 75 % volume fraction of the Ni/LY char. The catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> oil contained more aromatic hydrocarbons with slightly reduced oxygenated compounds than that from the non-catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> oil. High quantities of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained from <b>hydropyrolysis</b> with volume fraction of Ni/LY char > 50 %. The results indicated that the bio-oils from the <b>hydropyrolysis,</b> using high volume fraction of Ni/LY char (75 v/v%) at high catalytic <b>hydropyrolysis</b> temperature of 650 °C, contained more aromatic hydrocarbons with slightly reduced oxygenated compounds and could be used as liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. 学位記番号：工博甲 442, 学位の種類：博士（工学...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of coal {{is considered to be}} an attractive future route for the conversion of coal to gaseous and liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks. This thesis comprises a study of the behaviour of coal under the conditions pertinent to those envisaged within a commercial <b>hydropyrolysis</b> process, that is, using pulverised coal, a short coal-reactor residence time, high hydrogen pressure and high heating rate. For this purpose, an electrically heated grid apparatus has been used. The experimental conditions have been weighted towards achieving a maximum loss of primary volatile products whilst minimising unwanted and poorly controlled secondary reactions such as char hydrogasification. In this way, it has been possible to compare the influence of a hydrogen atmosphere on primary devolatilisation for a range of coals. Overall, the total volatile release is enhanced by <b>hydropyrolysis</b> to a degree dependent upon the partial pressure of the hydrogen. The increased yield is due mainly to an increase of saturated hydrocarbons, although the production of some individual species such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons are diminished with respect to helium pyrolysis. The magnitude of both total and individual product yields vary with coal type, as does the degree by which these yields are influenced by a hydrogen atmosphere. This influence is considered to depend specifically on the type and number of various reactive sites and functionalities within coal and also on their accessibility for hydrogen, which is in tum dependent upon the thermoplastic behaviour of the coal. A further factor governing both product yields and hydrogen influence is the coal petrographic composition. Inertinite macerals have been observed to be significantly more responsive than exinite or vitrinite to hydrogen, producing relatively high methane yields. Thus {{it has been shown that}} inertinite rich coals or enriched feedstocks may be suitable candidates for <b>hydropyrolysis</b> processing. The data obtained have also demonstrated how a number of coal properties obtained by standard analytical techniques may be used for coal selection and yield prediction. BS volatile matter, carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and both 0 /C and H/C atomic ratios are the most useful of the properties investigated in this respect. This is considered to be an important step towards the foundation of a classification system for <b>hydropyrolysis</b> processing...|$|E

Consequently, Manvers coal has been pyrolysed in an atmosphere of deuterium in order to obtain greater insight into the mechanism of <b>hydropyrolysis.</b> In particular it was hoped to distinguish between direct hydrogenation (deuteration!) of the coal and the products of pyrolysis and the 'shuttling' of hydrogen atoms between different parts of the pyrolysing coal.

The devolatilization rate of Beringen coal (32. 8 wt% volatile matter) treated on a fixed bed approximates to that obtained by flash <b>hydropyrolysis.</b> However, the oil yield is smaller because of the slower heating of the coal and the rather longer residence time of the primary volatile matter in the reaction space. The product gas is mainly methane. The oil composition depends on the temperature of pyrolysis. The benzene content of the oil rises with temperature. At constant temperature, the influence of hydrogen partial pressure is important between 0 - 1 MPa. At higher pressure, the yields and compositions vary only slightly with pressure.

Through comparison with Soxhlet extraction (SE), it was found that MoS 2 catalytic Hypy can remarkably promote the yields of total chloroform extracts, saturates, aromatics, hopanes and steranes. In addition, the difference of biomarker parameters indicated that isomerization of covalently-bound biomarkers is much more difficult than their free counterparts. Meanwhile, the high conversion of total organic carbon (TOC) in MoS 2 catalytic Hypy of organic matter proved that the presence of dispersed molybdenum sulfide accelerated the breaking of C-C bonds and the release of hydrocarbons. To address the catalytic mechanism, a series of control experiments based on free Hypy and catalytic Hypy were conducted. The results showed that the calculated atomic ratio of carbon conversion/hydrogen conversion for catalytic Hypy was much larger than the presumed value of 1 / 2, indicating that intensive hydrogenation took place and significantly influenced the distribution of liquid products. Analysis of stable hydrogen isotope data, infrared spectra and m/z 83 ion chromatograph of the saturate fraction further confirmed this hypothesis. The difference of S content changing (ΔS) between catalyst-free Hypy and catalytic Hypy, and the thermal characteristics of the catalyst, indicated that active H 2 S was definitely generated and it probably initiated free radical reactions in the early stage of <b>hydropyrolysis</b> of organic matter.|$|E

Under pure H 2 stream, Canadian pinewood was rapidly heated up to 500 °C and the generated vapors passed through a catalytic bed at 500 °C. Experiments were carried out in order to compare the catalytic performance of MoC/Al 2 O 3 catalyst to a reference catalyst based on noble metal (1. 5 wt. % Pt/Al 2 O 3). The effect of different supports (Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2 and MgO) on the carbide performance and product formation was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} performance of MoC/Al 2 O 3 was similar to that of 1. 5 wt. % Pt/Al 2 O 3. Both of them deoxygenated the <b>hydropyrolysis</b> vapors and led exclusively to hydrocarbons formation. However, the proportion of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons was different: MoC/Al 2 O 3 catalyst produced more aliphatics (57 %) than the Pt catalyst. The supports have demonstrated influence on the product distribution. Acidity of the support seems {{to play an important role}} in the deoxygenation of the vapors. While there was complete removal of oxygen when MoC/Al 2 O 3 and MoC/ZrO 2 were used, the same did not take place for the more basic MoC/MgO catalyst...|$|E
40|$|Second-generation {{biofuels}} utilizing lignocellulosic biomass {{are considered}} to be a promising alternative to fossil-based fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass is structurally diverse and therefore requires detailed understanding of the thermal depolymerization and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reactions to optimize the overall process. This dissertation describes the experimental work using model compounds to elucidate the role of bimetallic catalyst and control the reaction operating parameters such as temperature and hydrogen pressure to maximize energy recovery in the liquid product from biomass resource. ^ Water-gas shift (WGS) is a well-known reaction to produce hydrogen and finds application industrially in steam-reforming of methane and other fossil-based feedstocks. Traditionally, gas-phase WGS has been studied on noble metal based catalysts in experimental conditions relevant to reforming of methane. Recently, aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated organic compounds has been considered {{to be one of the}} promising routes to produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass derivatives. One of the hypothesis in that study was that WGS played a vital role in production of hydrogen and thus it is important to quantify and qualify the contribution of WGS under aqueous reforming conditions. Platinum (Pt) and platinum-molybdenum (Pt-Mo) catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were chosen since they were studied previously for aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol. Under these conditions, kinetics of WGS were significantly altered, especially CO order which is ∼ 0. 9 compared to ∼ 0. 1 for gas-phase WGS. Furthermore, Mo is shown to alter the kinetics of WGS reaction in a similar way both in gas and liquid-phase WGS. ^ Fast-hydropyrolysis followed by in-line catalytic hydrodeoxygenation has been shown to have the potential to produce hydrocarbon fuels using hydrogen as co-feed. The objective of the research project was to identify and quantify the primary products of fast <b>hydropyrolysis</b> as well as establish the effect of temperature on overall product distribution. A torch igniter typically used in rocket engines was modified to design a reactor that is able to continuously feed biomass at a g min- 1 scale and complete the entire process from fast <b>hydropyrolysis</b> to condensation of bio-oil in a matter of 3 ̆c 70 ms at 3. 6 MPa hydrogen pressure. Levoglucosan, cellobiosan, glycolaldehyde and glucopyranosyl-β-aldehyde were the major products from cellulose pyrolysis at 500 °C. As <b>hydropyrolysis</b> temperature was increased in the range of 500 to 700 °C, the bio-oil product distribution shifted toward C 2 -C 5 light oxygenates. The identification and quantification of products with molecular weight higher than the monomer (levoglucosan) at 70 ms residence time compared to their absence in reactors with residence time of 2 - 3 s indicate that levoglucosan is not the sole primary product of cellulose pyrolysis. Thus a portion of levoglucosan is a result of dimer (cellobiosan) and trimer (cellotriosan) degradation. ^ <b>Hydropyrolysis</b> of cellulose resulted in a product distribution that retained most of the oxygen from parent cellulose. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) therefore assumes the vital part of selectively removing that oxygen as water and thus transforming the oxygenated organic compounds to fungible hydrocarbon fuels. Furfural and dihydroeugenol were the chosen model compounds to represent cellulose and lignin fraction of biomass. Discerning the role of catalyst descriptors and hydrogen pressure were the main objectives of the study. A bimetallic catalyst system comprising platinum as a hydrogenation function and an oxophilic promoter molybdenum supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was used to achieve 100...|$|E

Experimental findings and derived mechanistic insights were organized into molecular-level reaction models for NBBM pyrolysis and catalysis. <b>Hydropyrolysis</b> and catalysis reaction families occurring during NBBM <b>hydropyrolysis</b> at 420 C were summarized in the form of reaction matrices which, upon exhaustive application to the components of the reacting system, yielded the mechanistic reaction model. Each reaction family also had an associated linear free energy relationship (LFER) which provided an estimate of the rate constant k{sub i} given a structural property of species i or its reaction. Including the catalytic reaction matrices with those for the pyrolysis model provided a comprehensive NBBM catalytic reaction model and allowed regression of fundamental LFER parameters for the catalytic reaction families. The model also allowed specification of the property of an optimal catalyst. Iron, molybdenum and palladium were predicted to be most effective for model compound consumption. Due to the low costs associated with iron and its disposal, it is a good choice for coal liquefaction catalysis and the challenge remains to synthesize small particles able to access the full surface area of the coal macromolecule...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydro{{pyrolysis}}</b> (Hypy) of a Spanish low rank coal in a preparative {{fixed bed}} reactor yields much more tar than pyrolysis (Py). The external hydrogen incorporated in the gas, tar and water yields {{is less than the}} total hydrogen incorporated in the products, as a result of more efficient extraction of hydrogen from char in a H 2 atmosphere. The higher devolatilization rate in He and H 2 occur at the same temperature, which coincides with an exothermic peak.

40|$|Cellulosic {{and woody}} biomass can be {{directly}} converted to hydrocarbon gasoline and diesel blending components {{through the use of}} a new, economical, technology named integrated <b>hydropyrolysis</b> plus hydroconversion (IH 2). The IH 2 gasoline and diesel blending components are fully compatible with petroleum based gasoline and diesel, contain less than 1 % oxygen and have less than 1 total acid number (TAN). The IH 2 gasoline is high quality and very close to a drop in fuel. The life cycle analysis (LCA) shows that the use of the IH 2 process to convert wood to gasoline and diesel results in a greater than 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas emission compared to that found with fossil derived fuels. The technoeconomic analysis showed the conversion of wood using the IH 2 process can produce gasoline and diesel at less than $ 2. 00 /gallon. In this project, the previously reported semi-continuous small scale IH 2 test results were confirmed in a continuous 50 kg/day pilot plant. The continuous IH 2 pilot plant used in this project was operated round the clock for over 750 hours and showed good pilot plant operability while consistently producing 26 - 28 wt % yields of high quality gasoline and diesel product.
