50|$|Several {{strategies}} for resolving geographic boundary problems in measurement and analysis {{have been proposed}} (Martin 1987; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). To <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the strategies, Griffith (1983) reviewed traditional techniques that were developed to mitigate the edge effects: ignoring the effects, undertaking a torus mapping, construction of an empirical butter zone, construction of an artificial butter zone, extrapolation into a buffer zone, utilizing a correction factor, etc. The first method (i.e., the ignorance of the edge effects), assumes and infinite surface in which the edge effects do not occur. In fact, this approach {{has been used by}} traditional geographical theories (e.g., central place theory). Its main shortcoming is that empirical phenomena occur within a finite area, so an infinite and homogeneous surface is unrealistic (Griffith and Amrhein 1983). The remaining five approaches are similar in that they attempted to produce unbiased parameter estimation, that is, to provide a medium by which the edge effects are removed (Griffith 1983). (He called these operational solutions as opposed to statistical solutions to be discussed below.) Specifically, the techniques aim at a collection of data beyond the boundary of the study area and fit a larger model, that is, mapping over the area or over-bounding the study area (Ripley 1979; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). Through simulation analysis, however, Griffith and Amrhein (1983) identified the inadequacy of such an overbounding technique. Moreover, this technique can bring about issues related to large-area statistics, that is, ecological fallacy. By expanding the boundary of the study area, micro-scale variations within the boundary can be ignored.|$|E

However {{the results of these}} attempts are controversial. In order to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of games in education, it is needed to define the quality in the games. In this article the aim is to identify the quality of any educational computer game in terms of three main categories which are enjoyment, learning and usability. In order to evaluate quality in games a scale to evaluate educational computer games is developed which evaluates learning and enjoyment characteristics of educational computer games. The scale will be used by teachers in order to identify the quality of the computer games before applied to students. Moreover, to develop the scale, a game model is also created. The model explains properties of a qualified game in terms of learning, enjoyment and usability. The model includes three parts as input, process and outcome which identified by Garris, Ahler and Driskell (2002).
