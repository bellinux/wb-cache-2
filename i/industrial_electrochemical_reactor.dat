5000|$|After the Second World War, {{interest}} focused {{towards the}} fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the potentiostat (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance {{was provided by}} the work of Carl Wagner and Veniamin Levich in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time [...] "The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering" [...] as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective. During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the [...] "father of electrochemical engineering" [...] by the Electrochemical Society, was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, John Newman pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and <b>industrial</b> <b>electrochemical</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R

In the oxygen-poor environment like in groundwater, arsenic exists mainly as As(III). For the purpose of obtaining a higher degree of removal of arsenic from contaminated groundwater, it is necessary to oxidize the As(III) to As(V) prior to the other treatment processes. In this work an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>reactor,</b> having an anode made from reticulated vitreous carbon of 100 pores per inch (100 ppi), was used to oxidize As(III) to As(V), this eliminates the need of adding more chemical substances to the treatment system.
