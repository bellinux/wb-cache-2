5000|$|The MFB {{operated}} eight <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> in 1927, {{out of the}} 38 in Queensland. Sandgate {{built its}} own station in 1924, and joined the MFB in 1928. By 1949 the MFB operated 14 stations; 11 of these were built of timber, with five of the timber stations being two-storey. Each of Brisbane's three operational brick <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> in 1949, Headquarters (1908), Woolloongabba <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> (1927), and Albion <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> (1927), had two or more floors.

5000|$|A Japanese fishing boat, Daigo Fukuryū Maru (Lucky Dragon No.5), came {{in direct}} contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one died of a {{secondary}} infection. This resulted in an international incident and reignited Japanese concerns about radiation, especially as Japanese citizens were once more adversely affected by US nuclear weapons. The official US position had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from the fishing vessel disagreed with this. Sir Joseph Rotblat, working at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout from the test was far greater than that stated officially. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase {{at the end of the}} explosion increased the amount of radioactivity a thousandfold. Rotblat's paper was taken up by the media, and the outcry in Japan reached such a level that diplomatic relations became strained and the incident was even dubbed by some as a [...] "second Hiroshima". Nevertheless, the Japanese and US governments quickly reached a political settlement, with the transfer to Japan of $15.3 million as compensation, with the surviving victims receiving about [...] 2 million each ($5,550 in 1954, or about $ in [...] ) It was also agreed that the victims would not be given Hibakusha status.Unanticipated fallout and the radiation emitted by it also affected many of the vessels and personnel involved in the test, in some cases forcing them into bunkers for several hours.

Stocks of weapons and ammunition that are found are either destroyed or seized and brought to Tessalit by French troops. The Islamists retreated and abandoned their positions in the valley of Ametettaï further south. A dozen of the Islamists are killed. Meanwhile, an armored squadron of AMX-10 RC supported by fighters, took part in a reconnaissance mission, northeast of Ifoghas and take over the villages of Boghassa and Tinzawatène [...] On the way an AMX-10 RC is damaged by mine but the French suffer no casualties.On the morning of March 12, soldiers from the 2nd Foreign Legion Parachute Regiment engaged a group of Islamist fighters, four of the Islamists were killed, and another was taken prisoner.

The driver of the armored vehicle, Corporal Alexander Van Dooren, was killed. The wounded were evacuated by medical helicopter to a field hospital in Tessalit.Between 18 and 21 March, French troops continued search and destroy missions in the Terz Valley, south of the Amettetai valley. The Chadian forces, commanded by General Deby, are positioned themselves to block out the escape routes and prevent the arrival of reinforcements from the region of Kidal. March 20, Chadian and French GTIA 3 perform their junction. During the operation, a truck containing a large stock of ammunition and shells is destroyed by EOD.

40|$|Coal and nonmetal mining used about 4. 3 {{billion pounds}} of {{explosives}} and blasting agents during 2001 in the United States. A {{major part of}} this consumption was related to surface mining. Mine Safety and Health Administration accident data indicate that flyrock and lack of blast area security were the primary causes of blasting-related injuries in surface mining. Fatal injuries {{due to lack of}} blast area security were primarily caused by failure to clear blast area or inadequate access control to the blast area. At a coal mine, a neighbor walked into the blast area and was fatally injured. The blaster could not see the victim entering the blast area from the <b>firing</b> <b>station.</b> In another case, a passenger in a vehicle was fatally injured by flyrock because highway traffic was not monitored during the blast. In another example, a dozer operator entered a blast area due to lack of access control. Several fatalities resulted from using inadequate or no blasting shelter. A crane operator was fatally injured while standing in the open about 120 ft from the blast site. In another instance, a helper, standing about 150 ft away from the edge of a blast, was fatally injured by flyrock. In a limestone mine an equipment operator was fatally injured while guarding access roads in a pickup truck. This paper briefly describes six representative fatalities due to flyrock and lack of blast area security in coal and nonmetal mines. Several mines were visited to collect information relative to working practices aimed at mitigating blasting hazards. Salient information obtained through these visits is presented...|$|E

It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. This paper deals with the 2 CH 101 computer used in the Central Fire Station System as installed in the U. S. Army Air Force's heavy bomber, type B- 29. Essentially, the computer consists of six servomechanisms which position gears, "waggle sticks", and finally four differential syncho-generators, the latter modifying signals sent from the sighting station for ballistic and land corrections developed within the computer and transmitting resultant gun orders to the <b>firing</b> <b>station.</b> In their report the authors have presented results of detailed tests on three of the servomechanism channels, the Range Input Channel, the Azimuth Input channel, and the Elevation Input channel. Tests were made from a transfer function viewpoint. Certain static sensitivities were measured. The Altitude and Airspeed Input channel and the Azimuth and Elevation-Total Correction channels were not tested in through detail since certain essential units of the system were not available. However, other pertinent information on these channels is presented insofar as experimental determination was possible. Briefly, the chief results and conclusions may be listed as follows: (1) The servomechanism channels are properly damped and stable but have a rather low resonant frequency; (2) maximum speed of follow-up in these channels, as listed by the driving motors, is too slow to handle modern, high-velocity problems; (3) solution time is relatively long, and is approximately proportional to the amount of total correction required; (4) the overall computer performance is limited by the connector or discontinuous type of servomechanism used. These function as proportional type servos, and as such have steady state velocity errors. [URL] Navy (U. S. N.) authors...|$|E
