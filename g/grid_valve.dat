50|$|This type of tetrode was {{developed}} to correct deficiencies in the triode tube which became apparent when {{attempts were made to}} use triodes as small-signal radio-frequency amplifiers. In the triode, the control grid was next to the plate. Capacitance between these two electrodes caused instability and oscillation when both anode and grid were connected into tuned resonant circuits, {{as was the case in}} early radios, or in any application where the anode circuit presented an inductive reactive load to the valve. Oscillation could only be avoided by using very small stage gain at frequencies above about 100 kHz, and at frequencies above 1 MHz, triodes are virtually useless in tuned amplifiers in which both anode and grid circuits are tuned to the same frequency. A second advantage of the tetrode, which also arose from reduced anode-grid capacitance, was that, when the anode voltage was in a certain range, changing its value had much less effect on the anode current than was the case with triodes. This corresponds to an increased anode slope resistance, and allowed much higher voltage gain by permitting a larger external load resistance. At the time of the introduction of screen-grid valves (around 1927) a typical small triode used for small-signal amplification had an anode slope resistance of 20kOhms or less, and a grid-anode capacitance of 1 to 5pF, while the corresponding figures for a typical screen <b>grid</b> <b>valve</b> were 1MOhm and 0.004pF - in some cases much less capacitance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intake valve}} is {{typically}} a reed valve. The two most common configurations are the daisy valve, and the rectangular <b>valve</b> <b>grid.</b> A daisy <b>valve</b> {{consists of a}} thin sheet of material to act as the reed, cut {{into the shape of}} a stylized daisy with [...] "petals" [...] that widen towards their ends. Each [...] "petal" [...] covers a circular intake hole at its tip. The daisy valve is bolted to the manifold through its centre. Although easier to construct on a small scale, it is less effective than a <b>valve</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the grid}} leak stage had a {{transformer}} input, the <b>valve</b> <b>grid</b> connected to {{one end of}} the transformer secondary, and {{the other end of the}} secondary went to ground via the grid leak resistor and a small bypass capacitor.|$|R
50|$|Only class A {{can be used}} in {{single-ended}} mode, as part of {{the signal}} would otherwise be cut off. The driver stage for class AB2 and B valve amplifiers must be capable of supplying some signal current to the power <b>valve</b> <b>grids</b> ("driving power").|$|R
50|$|The British Leak company used an EM84 {{indicator}} as a {{very precise}} tuning-indicator in their Troughline FM tuner series, by mixing the AGC voltages from the two limiter <b>valve</b> <b>grids</b> at the indicator sensing-grid. By this means accurate tuning was indicated by a fully open sharp shadow, whilst off-tune the indicator produced a partially closed shadow.|$|R
5000|$|In 1946, Ashby {{described}} {{the design of}} the units thus [...] "Its principle is that it uses multiple coils in a milliammeter & uses the needle movement to dip in a trough carrying a current, so getting a potential which goes to the <b>grid</b> of a <b>valve,</b> the anode of which provides an output current." [...] It was the realization of what he had described in 1946 as an [...] "Isomorphism making machine".|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} pentode {{would seem}} an {{unlikely}} choice for a frequency converter because it only has one control grid. However, during the Great Depression, many American radio manufacturers used pentode types 6C6, 6D6, 77 and 78 in their lowest priced AC/DC receivers because they were cheaper than pentagrid type 6A7. In these circuits, the suppressor (grid 3) acted as the oscillator <b>grid,</b> and the <b>valve</b> operated {{in a similar manner}} to a true pentagrid.|$|R
50|$|The grid is kept at ground, {{the drive}} {{is applied to}} the cathode through a capacitor. The heater supply must be {{isolated}} with great care from the cathode as unlike the other designs the cathode is not connected to RF ground. The cathode may be at the same DC potential as the <b>grid</b> if a <b>valve</b> such as the 811A (zero bias triode) is used, otherwise the cathode must be positive with respect to the grid to provide proper bias. This may be done by putting a zener diode between the cathode and ground, or by connecting a suitable power supply to the cathode.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the ride}} began, the saucers {{would be subject}} to a high volume of {{low-pressure}} air directed underneath the saucers by means of a <b>grid</b> of circular <b>valves</b> from a plenum chamber below the field on which they operated. As the saucers moved about the field, the valves would open and close in response to their proximity. As guests shifted their weight in any direction by leaning, saucer movement would respond by means of an air jet derived from the increased pressure in the saucer's plenum. [...] If weight was centered, the saucer would begin to [...] "hop" [...] up and down as the air randomly escaped around the plenum. All that was required to regain control was for the guest to lean in any direction.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an extended version of KIVA- 3, known as KIVA- 3 V, that can model {{any number of}} vertical or canted valves in the cylinder head of an internal combustion (IC) engine. The valves are treated as solid objects that move through the mesh using the familiar snapper technique used for piston motion in KIVA- 3. Because the valve motion is modeled exactly, and the valve shapes are as exact as the grid resolution will allow, {{the accuracy of the}} valve model is commensurate with that {{of the rest of the}} program. Other new features in KIVA- 3 V include a particle-based liquid wall film model, a new sorting subroutine that is linear in the number of nodes and preserves the original storage sequence, a mixing-controlled turbulent combustion model, and an optional RNG {kappa}-{epsilon} turbulence model. All features and capabilities of the original KIVA- 3 have been retained. The grid generator, K 3 PREP, has been expanded to support the generation of <b>grids</b> with <b>valves,</b> along with the shaping of valve ports and runners. Graphics output options have also been expanded. The report discusses the new features, and includes four examples of grids with vertical and canted valves that are representative of IC engines in use today...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{numerical}} simulation of flow through an artificial heart and through an artificial tilting-disk heart valve are presented. The simulation involves solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations; the solution process is described. The details and difficulties of modeling these particular geometries are discussed. The artificial heart geometry uses a single moving <b>grid,</b> and the <b>valve</b> computation uses an overlaid-grid approach with one moving grid and one stationary grid. The equations must be solved iteratively for each discrete time step of the computations, requiring {{a significant amount of}} computing time. It is particularly difficult to analyze and present the fluid physics represented by these calculations because of the time-varying nature of the flow, and because the flows are internal. Three-dimensional graphics and scientific visualization techniques have become instrumental in solving these problems...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{efforts to}} develop the {{capability}} to model valves used in rocket engine component testing at Stennis Space Center are documented. An axisymmetric model of a control valve with LN 2 as the working fluid was developed. The goal was to predict the effect {{of change in the}} plug/sear region of the valve prior to testing. The valve flow coefficient was predicted for a range of plug positions. Verification of the calculations was carried out to quantify the uncertainty in the numerical answer. The modeled results compared well qualitatively to experimental trends. Additionally, insights into the flow processes in the valve were obtained. Benefits from the verification process included the ability to use coarser grids and insight into ways to reduce computational time by using double precision accuracy and non-integer <b>grid</b> ratios. Future <b>valve</b> modeling activities will include shape optimization of the valve/seat region and dynamic grid modeling...|$|R
50|$|First {{proposed}} in 1914, the <b>grid</b> controlled mercury-arc <b>valve</b> became available for power transmission {{during the period}} 1920 to 1940. Starting in 1932, General Electric tested mercury-vapor valves and a 12 kV DC transmission line, which also served to convert 40 Hz generation to serve 60 Hz loads, at Mechanicville, New York. In 1941, a 60 MW, ±200 kV, 115 km buried cable link was designed {{for the city of}} Berlin using mercury arc valves (Elbe-Project), but owing to the collapse of the German government in 1945 the project was never completed. The nominal justification for the project was that, during wartime, a buried cable would be less conspicuous as a bombing target. The equipment was moved to the Soviet Union and was put into service there as the Moscow-Kashira HVDC system. The Moscow-Kashira system and the 1954 connection by Uno Lamm's group at ASEA between the mainland of Sweden and the island of Gotland {{marked the beginning of the}} modern era of HVDC transmission.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the effect on orifice {{discharge}} characteristic by the round angle of electro-hydraulic servo valve spool metering edge. The machining method of spool metering edge can cause micro round angle on the edge. This paper firstly provides 3 D geometry model and computational <b>grids</b> of spool <b>valve</b> where the round angle’s range is 0 - 10 µm and orifice opening is 0 - 40 µm. Secondly calculates the flow rate of the orifice on the constant differential pressure circumstances. The numerical analysis is performed by using the commercial code ‘‘Fluent’’, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. The analysis result is to obtain the influence of round angle on discharge characteristic, quantitatively. An experimental result is used in this paper to evaluate and validate the numerical analysis of the valve. The aim of this analysis {{is to provide a}} designation reference of the spool valves which are important parts of servo valve...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} step through an effective redesign of valved pulsejet. This redesign activity relates to both thermodynamics and heat transfer. It aims {{to overcome their}} intrinsic limits: short service life of the valves and low energy efficiency of the Lenoir cycle. A {{detailed analysis of the}} operative behavior of pulsejets allowed the authors to advance an effective hypothesis about redesigning this propulsion system. A preliminary bibliographic analysis shows that the very high temperature that the walls of the combustion chamber reaches does not allow the use of more effective valves with respect to the petal <b>valves</b> or <b>grid</b> mounted reed <b>valves.</b> The absence of any compression, which is a characteristic property of the Lenoir cycle, is the main cause of the low thermodynamic efficiency of the system. The intrinsic fragility of these valve systems has blocked any further development of the valved pulsejet. A preliminary feasibility analysis of a cooling system, which can be used on pulsejets, is then a preliminary element both in the direction of improving both their thermodynamic performance and their robustness. The considered working conditions are: temperature of 1500 K, which oscillates with an amplitude ± 500 k and a frequency of 30 Hz. The refrigerant is considered water and its average temperature is supposed 80 ºC. Analysis of the temperature profile within the wall and the effects of the oscillations of gas temperature have been evaluated, together with a preliminary design of the cooling system...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the exergy losses {{stemming}} from heat transfer in compressors and expanders {{is important for}} many energy storage applications such as compressed air and pumped thermal storage. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} these losses, CFD simulations were performed for simple gas springs, for a gas spring with an internal <b>grid</b> to mimic <b>valve</b> flow, and for a reciprocating compressor with functioning inlet and outlet valves. The wall heat exchanges for these three cases were examined and compared. The model adopted has previously been validated for a simple gas spring using experimental data from literature. For the gas spring with an internal grid it was found that increased mixing leads to higher heat-transfer-induced hysteresis losses and (at high piston speeds) to a significant pressure loss. These two types of loss can be distinguished by undertaking adiabatic-wall calculations. For a compressor (i. e., with valve flows) heat transfer over the cycle depends very much on valve timing. For example, at 1500 rpm, when the delivery valve is opened at 7 bar the heat transfer coefficient for the initial stages of compression is similar to that for a simple gas spring, whereas for the same speed at 6 bar it is more than doubled.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this PhD {{research}} is to develop non-invasive and cost-effective techniques for assessing the structural condition of pressurised pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. The specific objectives include the detection of leaks and localised deterioration that is distributed along a pipeline, such as extended sections of corrosion or the spalling of cement lining. The latter is described by pipeline condition assessment in this thesis. The transient behaviour of a leak is studied in the frequency domain. Numerical studies conducted in this research demonstrate that two leak-induced patterns (on the resonant and the anti-resonant responses) can exist in a frequency response diagram (FRD). The amplitudes of the responses {{are related to the}} impedance of the valve in a reservoir-pipeline-valve (RPV) system. A new leak detection technique has been developed in this research based on the further understanding of the leak-induced patterns. This technique uses the relative sizes of the first three resonant responses to determine the location and size of a single leak in RPV systems. In reservoir-pipeline-dead end systems, the information required for single event leak detection is further reduced to the first two resonant responses. A new measurement strategy for the extraction of the FRD of single pipelines is proposed in this research. The boundary valve loss is used to adjust the amplitude of the leak-induced pattern on the resonant responses and also the sharpness of the resonant peaks. A specific type of pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) termed the inverse repeat sequence (IRS), is used as the excitation signal. The antisymmetric property of IRS enables part of the nonlinear responses of the system under excitation to be cancelled out, yielding a measured FRD close to the theoretical linear system response. A side-discharge valve based transient generator is designed and fabricated in this research to implement the new FRD measurement strategy. Laboratory experiments are conducted on an intact pipeline and a pipeline with a leak. This research also conducts analysis of the characteristics of distributed pipe wall deterioration and develops new detection techniques. In a measured pressure trace, the size of the reflection resulting from a section of pipeline with a change in wall thickness is indicative of the characteristic impedance of this section. Once the impedance of this section is determined, the wave speed and wall thickness can be estimated. A technique for the detection of a single deteriorated section in pipelines is developed based on the above analysis. Two other condition assessment techniques are developed to deal with the complexities induced by multiple deteriorated sections. The first technique is termed reconstructive MOC (method of characteristics) analysis, which uses the pressure trace measured at the upstream face of the valve in a RPV system to determine the distribution of the impedance along the pipeline. The algorithm reconstructs a MOC grid by calculating the MOC compatibility equations backwards in time, estimating the properties of the pipeline (impedance, wave speed) and the length of each pipe reach as discretised by the MOC <b>grid</b> from the <b>valve</b> towards the reservoir. Preliminary experimental verification is conducted to verify the applicability of the new technique. The second technique is reconstructive transient analysis (RTA), which can be conducted at any interior accessible points along a pipeline, and does not require a RPV boundary condition. The RTA uses two pressure transducers in close proximity to measure two transient pressure traces in one test. A signal processing algorithm is developed to extract the directional transient waves (traveling upstream and downstream). The use of the directional transient waves enables the step response function (SRF) of the section of pipe upstream or downstream of the paired pressure transducers to be obtained. The reconstructive MOC analysis is then adapted to interpret the SRF to yield the distribution of the impedance, from which the location and severity of distributed deterioration can be identified.
