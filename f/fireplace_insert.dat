50|$|<b>Fireplace</b> <b>inserts</b> {{are popular}} {{with people who}} have an {{existing}} open fireplace and chimney, since they significantly improve both fuel efficiency and heat output while also providing an attractive focal point to a room. The disadvantages when compared to a free standing wood burning stove are that they are more expensive to install and obviously also depend upon there being a usable fireplace and chimney in the first place.Electric <b>fireplace</b> <b>inserts</b> are made to fit any size of brick or steel covered hearth. Electric <b>fireplace</b> <b>inserts</b> come in three form factors: electric log inserts (which imitate a natural wood flame), plug-in inserts and built-in units. Plug-in electric <b>fireplace</b> <b>inserts</b> typically connect to a common 120-volt wall plug and are placed within an existing fireplace.|$|R

50|$|All-{{electric}} {{heat pump}} systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This {{serves as an}} adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to central forced-air systems and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric <b>fireplace</b> <b>inserts</b> can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to solar panels as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.|$|R

40|$|Residential wood {{combustion}} from fireplaces and woodstoves is {{a source}} of emissions of particulate matter for many areas of the country. In EPA’s National Emission Trends inventory fireplaces and woodstoves are treated as areas sources. Inventory emission estimates are determined from the product of activity levels (mass of wood burned annually) and emission factors (mass of pollutants emitted per mass of wood burned). This paper describes a new approach for calculating activity levels that utilizes current data on residential wood combustion devices and updated survey information. Activity levels (wood consumption) were developed by device type since emission factors are different for different device types and the urban/rural usage pattern is also different for them. The three main device types are: (1) fireplaces, (2) fireplaces with inserts, and (3) woodstoves. The fireplace category was further subdivided into fireplaces used for heating purposes and those used for aesthetic or pleasure purposes. The woodstove and <b>fireplace</b> <b>insert</b> categories were subdivided into non-certified devices, certified catalytic devices and certified non-catalytic devices. While industry, private sector, and local survey data were used in developing the approach, public sector data provides the basis of the activity level estimates. The public sector data compiled by the America...|$|E
40|$|Reviewed October 1993. "The idea of inserts {{came about}} for three reasons. First, {{research}} showed that conventional fireplaces were very inefficient and, therefore, not an effective heat source. Second, since the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Americans {{have become more}} aware of energy. Third, because a high percentage of American homes already have these inefficient fireplaces, people began searching for a solution. Generally, inserts greatly improve heat generation efficiency in comparison to the conventional brick or stone fireplace. Fireplaces are 10 percent efficient at best, and as the outside temperature drops, their efficiency declines. On the other hand, a good insert can operate at 40 percent efficiency if it is fired properly. Because the cost of inserts ranges from $ 800 to $ 1500, consumers wonder whether putting an insert into their fireplace is a wise economic choice. Of course, this depends on how often the <b>fireplace</b> (<b>insert)</b> is used. If you only use your fireplace occasionally and not necessarily as a heat source, then the purchase of an insert is not a good choice. On the other hand, if you plan to burn one or more cords of wood per year for the heat, then buying the insert may be wise. The more wood you plan on burning each year for heat, the shorter the payback period will be...|$|E
2500|$|Wood heat {{continues}} {{to be used in}} areas where firewood is abundant. [...] For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open <b>fireplaces),</b> stoves, <b>fireplace</b> <b>inserts,</b> and furnaces are most commonly used today. [...] In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. [...] They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using underground piping. [...] The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. [...] The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night, and can burn larger pieces of wood, so that less cutting and splitting is required. [...] There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. [...] However, outdoor wood boilers emit more wood smoke and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. [...] This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. [...] Outdoor wood boilers also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. [...] An alternative that is increasing in popularity are wood gasification boilers, which burn wood at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding. There are plenty of ways to process wood fuel and the inventions today are maximizing by the minute.|$|R
50|$|His Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in London when he introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. This was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces. He and his workers modified <b>fireplaces</b> by <b>inserting</b> bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. The effect was to produce a streamlined air flow, so all the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering and entering the room. It also had the effect of increasing the efficiency of the fire, and gave extra control of the rate of combustion of the fuel, whether wood or coal. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions, and became free of smoke.|$|R
5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller <b>fireplace</b> was <b>inserted</b> into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the kitchen is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|R
25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed <b>fireplaces</b> by <b>inserting</b> bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|R
