25|$|The MEMS {{community}} had employed bonded cover techniques to enclose other MEMS components, for instance pressure sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, and these techniques were adapted to resonators. In this approach, cover wafers were micromachined with small cavities and bonded to the resonator wafers, enclosing the resonators in small evacuated cavities. Initially these wafers were bonded with low melting temperature glass, called <b>glass</b> <b>frit,</b> but recently other bonding technologies including metallic compression and metallic amalgams, have replaced <b>glass</b> <b>frit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early covered {{resonators}} with <b>glass</b> <b>frit</b> seals were unstable because contaminants outgassed {{from the}} sealing material. To overcome this, getters were {{built into the}} cavities. Getters are materials that can absorb gas and contaminants after cavities are sealed. However, getters can also release contaminants and can be costly, so their use in this application is being discontinued in favor of cleaner cover bonding processes.|$|E

25|$|Glass solders {{are used}} to join glasses to other glasses, ceramics, metals, semiconductors, mica, and other materials, in a process called <b>glass</b> <b>frit</b> bonding. The glass solder has to flow and wet the {{soldered}} surfaces well below the temperature where deformation or degradation of either of the joined materials or nearby structures (e.g., metallization layers on chips or ceramic substrates) occurs. The usual temperature of achieving flowing and wetting is between 450 and 550°C.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant has}} three process lines {{and is based}} on the French AVM procedure. Principal item is an inductively heated melting furnace, in which the {{calcined}} waste is merged with <b>glass</b> <b>frit</b> (glass beads of 1 to 2mm in diameter). The melt is placed into waste containers, which are welded shut, their outsides decontaminated and then brought into air-cooled storage facilities. This storage consists of 800 vertical storage tubes, each capable of storing ten containers. The total storage capacity is 8000 containers, and 5000 containers have been stored to 2010.|$|E
25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a <b>glass</b> <b>frit</b> having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} research {{carried out}} at the University of Southampton into {{the development of a}} magnetostrictive thick-film material suitable for use with silicon micromachined devices. This form of magnetostrictive material has previously been deposited onto alumina substrates and this paper reports further work on migrating the technology onto silicon. The evaluation of two alternative <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> for use as the binder within the thick film is reported. The correct choice of the binder material is important in a thick-film material because it is responsible for binding the active material within the thick film into a composite material and also adhering the film to the substrate. A series of tests have been applied to samples fabricated using various <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> to assess their mechanical properties and suitability for the micro-actuator applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have been}} significantly {{used for the}} field emitters for display applications. However, the lifetime of CNT emitters which are formed by screen printing technique is not guaranteed yet, because the constituents in CNT paste affect the lifetime of CNTs. The CNT pastes for screen printing are normally composed of organic vehicles (nitro cellulose, ethyl cellulose, etc) and additives (<b>glass</b> <b>frits,</b> indium tin oxide (ITO), etc) with CNTs. In this study, the effects of constituents in CNT pastes on the lifetime and emission characteristics of CNTs were investigated by thermal and electrical analysis. Use of <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> worsened the lifetime and electron emission of CNTs. However, an addition of ITO to CNT paste rather improved the lifetime of CNTs. Degradation of CNTs was small when nitro cellulose was used in CNT paste as an organic vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Hollow glass {{microspheres}} (HGMs) are {{a unique}} class of materials with interconnected nano-pores in the microsphere walls, which can adsorb, retain and release hydrogen and other gases. In this study, HGMs was prepared from amber coloured and borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>frits.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> after the preliminary washing and drying was sized to particles below 120 µm.

Effect of glass feed particle size as well as feed rate, {{in the formation of}} HGMs was studied. Amber glass feed particle size> 75 µm was found to give very poor yield ( 95 %) for HGMs. In the case of borosilicate glass feed, particle size 38 - 63 µm gave around 80 % conversion to HGMs. Further, study of the process parameters and constant monitoring to regulate the process are being carried out in our laboratory to arrive at a correct figure for the yield of HGMs. Characterisation of the HGMs prepared was done using Image analysing system, SEM, and XRD.

40|$|Solar {{cells and}} {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{are the two}} most beneficial optoelectronic devices to humanity with opposite functions: one converts photons into electrical power and the other one converts electrons into luminance. Remarkable advances in both applications have been made in both novel chip-level design and packaging technologies, and the continuous innovation and improvement of packaging materials and methods have played key roles in the past two decades. In this work, new packaging materials and technologies are introduced to both silicon solar cells and LEDs to enhance their performance. The first part of this work was to develop a new silver paste with different <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> for front-side metallization in silicon solar cells. It is shown that the replacement of micro-sized <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> by nano-sized ones can dramatically reduce the specific contact resistivity between the resultant silver electrodes and the n-type silicon layer due to the excellent etching ability of nanopartilces on removing the anti-reflection coating (ARC). Surface modification on nano-sized <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> by electroless plating can further improve the electrical performance by offering extra conducting channel within the insulating layers. In the second part of this work, the influence of different die attach adhesives (DAAs) on optical and thermal performance of LED emitters was studied. The results show that with an optically clear DAA applied, the highest optical output can be achieved due to its high transparency. The optically reflective DAA also exhibit excellent optical performance, especially at low fillet coverage, which block the photons escaping from the side walls. For high power LED applications, the optically reflective DAA can achieve better thermal management than the conventional one when the bondline thickness is controlled at 7. 6 micron. The last part of this work focuses on the interaction between the LED emitters and the backside reflector, which is used to reflect the downward photons. Our results show that with both optically clear and reflective DAAs, the light output of LED emitters can be very close to that of LED emitters with backside reflectors...|$|R

30|$|Sealant {{materials}} like Surlyn® and Bynel® hotmelt foils {{are used}} in DSSCs to seal the cells [48]. Their sealing capability decreases when the pressure builds up inside the cell [51] and also if exposed within a cyclic or regular temperature variation [52]. But due to their low cost and easy processing, their utilization cannot be neglected. Thus, it is required to increase their adhesion with glass by pretreatment of the glass with metal oxide particles. As an alternative, sealants based on low melting <b>glass</b> <b>frits</b> [53] were also developed which offer more stability than the hotmelt foils, but these sealants are not suitable for the large area module production.|$|R
