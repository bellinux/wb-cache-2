25|$|Studies {{have also}} tested the {{responses}} of women to outgroups, and have shown that women {{are most likely to}} fear outgroup males during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, when fertility is at its peak. Women also have more negative responses around peak fertility when the males belong to an outgroup that the woman associates with physical formidability, even if the group was constructed in the lab. Overall, women who <b>feel</b> <b>most</b> at risk of sexual coercion are more likely to fear outgroup males, which aligns with the predictions of the MWH.|$|E

500|$|After Buller [...] {{received}} a letter from Wontners confirming that civil action was taking place, he consulted the Judge Advocate General, who informed him that no military enquiry should take place while such a case was proceeding. Lewis then tried to persuade the Guards' Club, of which Gordon-Cumming was a member, to carry out an enquiry into the events, which would have negated much of the need for a trial. A vote of the members rejected the possibility, and the civil trial remained the outcome. The prince was furious with the Guards, and wrote to Ponsonby that [...] "The decision of the Guards Club is a terrible blow to the Scots Guards; and I <b>feel</b> <b>most</b> deeply for the officers who have the honour of their regiment so much at heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>most</b> deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E

An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [...] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express." [...] Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, [...] "Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of {{three out of four}}: [...] "It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own." [...] Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: [...] "The best moments in his [...] first movie outing are those that <b>feel</b> <b>most</b> TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg."

[...] Additionally, the Soap Opera Network magazine noted a [...] "sudden boom" [...] in ratings in the episodes surrounding their reunion, which was also attributed to other subplots. The show gained 447,000 total viewers for the week of January 26–30, which was described as [...] "pretty incredible" [...] by SoapNet. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said, [...] "Many fans were overjoyed that Nick and Sharon finally reconnected and made love in the cabin."

2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I <b>feel</b> <b>most</b> moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E
