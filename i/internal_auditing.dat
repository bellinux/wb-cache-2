40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} two aspects of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> quality, namely <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> {{competency}} and <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> contribution to financial statement audits. Consistent with the substitution view, this study predicts a negative relationship between the competency aspects of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> (the tenure {{of the existence of}} <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in the organization, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff expertise in IT and computer skills, training hours, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff professional certifications in accounting and <b>auditing,</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff experience in auditing) and audit fees. Second, this study tests whether the contribution of internal auditors to financial statement audit reduces audit fees. The data analysis is based on a cross-sectional regression model with observations of 73 public-listed firms in Malaysia, which include publicly available data matched with survey responses from their internal and external auditors. The results of the study suggest that the competency of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> namely the tenure of the existence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in the organization, training, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff prior experience in auditing and accounting, and certifications are associated with lower audit fees.

40|$|This {{paper has}} focused {{much on the}} {{independence}} and performance of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. The research objectives of this project are {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the management in all council operations, to assess effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> controls both existing and proposed functions, to examine challenges faced by Chitungwiza municipality in upholding independence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and accountability including managementâ€™s behaviour, to determine types of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and their subsequent efficient methods at the council, to investigate how size and resourcing of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> affect objectivity and efficiency and to recommend strategies of establishing an effective and independent <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> In the literature review methods of measuring the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> activity were discussed in detail. This study provides empirical evidence as to the main factors influencing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness can be only enhanced through its independence; there are various factors that contribute to autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. These factors are namely competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> the size of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department, the relationship between internal and external auditors, management support for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. The results suggested that management should support the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and promote <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> autonomy from political interference. This would bring effectiveness of both the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and management. In this context, literature was also reviewed whereby different views were given towards autonym of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> was defined, forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> that <b>internal</b> auditors comply with such as Financial audit, Risk management and system controls, Advisory and investigative service and Performance audit. The researcher used research methodology that was mutually blended with both qualitative and quantitative research designs. The population for this research is 497 people constituting general employees (top management, lower level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees, councillors and the workers union members. The sample population is 50 and it constitutes 25 from the general lower level employees, 7 from the top management, 10 from councillors, 4 from <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees and 4 from the workers committee. The research tools used were interviews and questionnaires which had both open-ended and closed questions. Sampling techniques used are purposive, stratified and simple random sampling. Data was gathered from this targeted population through the use of face to face interviews and questionnaires. The researcher presented data which reveals different types and forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> Moreover, challenges that are faced by Chitungwiza municipality in enhancing independent <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> were unfolded by respondents. Respondents also cited that independence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> has different benefits such as effectiveness, accountability, transparency and efficiency.
