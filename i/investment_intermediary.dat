40|$|Abstract. Community-based {{organizations}} promote {{economic development}} by assembling investments in affordable housing, mixed-use real estate, community facilities, {{and small business}} in specific geographies. A principal way that community-based organizations tap institutional investors for deals is by partnering with investment intermediaries who manage the risk of these transactions by pooling assets, spreading risk across investors, and pricing the transaction up to the associated risk. Such a partnership allows an <b>investment</b> <b>intermediary,</b> or what the industry calls an “investment vehicle, ” to use its expertise to structure a deal that delivers high financial returns to the institutional investor while allowing the community-based organization, or “community partner, ” {{to ensure that the}} investment provides a community benefit. In this paper, we argue that both sets of actors are necessary to achieve revitalized communities. Communities {{need to be able to}} tap into large-scale investment opportunities made possible by institutional investors while simultaneously ensuring that community residents benefit from such investment. We develop case studies of two investment vehicles and their community partners: the first investment vehicle we examine is the Urban Strategies America Fund, a for-profit urban development real estate fund in Boston; the second is Coastal Enterprises, Inc., of Portland, Maine...|$|E

40|$|Large {{institutional}} investors, such {{as public}} sector pension funds, invest in affordable housing, mixed-income and mixed-use real estate, and emerging growth companies {{under the rubric}} of urban revitalization or economic development. Investment intermediaries link institutional investors to urban revitalization. As a pension fund does not have urban investing expertise they turn to an <b>investment</b> <b>intermediary,</b> often referred to as an investment fund manager or termed “investment vehicle”, to deploy large pools of capital into the community. The money managers are able to take large dollar amounts and parcel the funds into attractive urban investments. They have the expertise to structure a deal in a community partnership that delivers high financial returns to the investor and social returns to the community. An investment vehicle can have in-depth expertise investing in large-scale property development and mission-oriented companies. Community partners also act as an intermediary between the investment vehicle and the urban community. The community organization can ensure that the ancillary social goals are realized. We argue that without these intermediaries large institutional dollars could not be deployed in the underserved markets and could not achieve the targeted financial and social goals. Keywords.

These rules, in addition to being part of the regulation of <b>investment</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> operate as contractual standards in the relationships between intermediaries and their clients.

40|$|Anxieties {{about the}} effects of {{international}} property investment in world cities like London have mainly focused on super-rich investors and corporate vehicles that have generated price inflation of assets and accelerated exclusion from an already expensive market. In fact, many international investors in the city’s housing market are middle-class individuals, and focusing on Hong Kong as an emblematic example of such processes, we examine their motives and the products offered to them by important <b>investment</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> We find that an important rationale for these investments lies in local class-based uncertainties and existential anxieties concerning the future of Hong Kong itself. We focus on the cultural roots of these investor rationalities but also consider the role of <b>investment</b> <b>intermediaries</b> who have helped bolster confidence while shielding investors from the consequences of their aggregated market power - concerns in London over household displacement from foreign investment. We suggest that what may seem to be the predatory search to ‘fry’ property (炒樓), a Hongkonger colloquialism referring to the search for high performing investments, should also be understood as actions anchored in and generated by the habitus of the Hong Kong middle-class whose lives have been moulded by historical geopolitical uncertainty and worries about its longer-term social positioning and security...|$|R

40|$|Two factors play {{a decisive}} {{role in the}} {{structuring}} of Internet based markets for infomediation (informational intermediation) : network externalities and information processing. First, these are examined separately. The two-sided markets literature focuses {{on the impact of}} network externalities in a context of competition among 2 -sided platforms. It explains the level of concentrationfragmentation of those markets, and explores its welfare implications. We shall call this model the "horizontal" model of structuring. Symetrically, a "vertical" process of division of labour among the infomediaries' value chain is observed. It results of the complexification of intermediation in a context of strong quality uncertainty and high codification <b>investments.</b> <b>Intermediaries</b> specialize and develop cooperative relationships with each others. Secondly, the paper examines the implications of the simultaneous co-existence of H and D dynamics on the structuring of the market for infomediation. This co-existence generates frictions.

Private equity impact investing is a new alternative asset class that {{is regarded as a}} highly efficient instrument for allocating capital whilst achieving impact. This paper investigates the factors that are influencing Private Equity Impact Investing in South Africa, and it provides an exploratory investigation into the landscape of public policy that affects this asset class. This research is relevant through identifying trends and best practice for Private Equity Impact Investing in emerging markets, and evaluating their suitability for adoption in South Africa.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} a monetary economy which is characterized by increasing returns to scale in financial intermediation. The intermediation technology is linear in deposits, but its operation requires a fixed verification cost to overcome the asymmetric information about a borrower's <b>investment</b> outcome. <b>Intermediaries,</b> termed banks, can avoid the costly duplication of information disclosure. Due to the non [...] convexity in intermediation activities, two stationary monetary equilibria exist. The first is a saddle with high economic activity and high competition in banking. In the second equilibrium, competition between banks and economic activity are low. Under adverse economic conditions, the low activity equilibrium can bifurcate into a sink and the economy may experience periods of financial instability and banking crises. Although crises are random events, the economy's exposure to financial instabilities depends on fundamental conditions. Thus, the predictive power of fundamentals does not contradict the random theory of crises. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
