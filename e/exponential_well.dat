Suppose that the entries of F are polynomials given by a straight-line program of size L and their total degrees are bounded by an integer D. We show that there exists a well parallelizable algorithm which computes bases of the kernel {{and the image of}} F in time (nL) O(1) (MD) O(n). By means of this result we obtain a single exponential algorithm to compute a basis of a complete intersection ring in Noether position. More precisely, let f 1,…,fn−r∈k[x 1,…,xn] be a regular sequence of polynomials given by a slp of size ℓ, whose degrees are bounded by d. Let R≔k[x 1,…,xr] and S≔k[x 1,…,xn]/(f 1,…,fn−r) such that S is integral over R; we show that there exists an algorithm running in time O(n) ℓdO(n 2) which computes a basis of S over R. Also, as a consequence of our techniques, we show a single <b>exponential</b> <b>well</b> parallelizable algorithm which decides the freeness of a finite k[x 1,…,xn]-module given by a presentation matrix, and in the affirmative case it computes a basis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{find the}} cause of the skinning-induced {{fragility}} of frog skeletal muscle, the transverse relaxation process of 1 H-NMR signals from skinned muscle was observed. A set of four characteristic <b>exponentials</b> <b>well</b> described the process. Aside from the extremely slow exponential component (time constant T 2 > 0. 4 s) representing surplus solution, the process was generally slower than that in living muscle. It had larger amplitudes of slow (T 2 ≈ 0. 15 s) and intermediate (0. 03 <T 2 < 0. 06 s) exponentials and had smaller amplitude and faster T 2 in the rapid one (T 2 < 0. 03 s), suggesting that skinned muscle is more sol-like than intact myoplasm. To resolve their causes, we traced the exponentials following a stepwise treatment of living whole muscle to an isolated skinned fiber. Osmotic expansion of living muscle comparable to skinned muscle increased the intermediate exponential and decreased the rapid one without affecting T 2. Subsequent chemical skinning markedly increased the slow exponential, decreased the rapid one, and slowed the intermediate one. The fiber isolation had no appreciable effect. Because l-carnosine at physiological concentration could not recover the skinning-induced difference, the difference would reflect the dilution and efflux of larger macromolecules, which stabilize myoplasm as a gel...|$|R
40|$|Usually, the {{reflection}} probability R(E) of a particle of zero energy incident on a potential which converges to zero asymptotically {{is found to}} be 1 : R(0) = 1. But earlier, a paradoxical phenomenon of zero reflection at zero energy (R(0) = 0) has been revealed as a threshold anomaly. Extending the concept of Half Bound State (HBS) of 3 D, here we show that in 1 D when a symmetric (asymmetric) attractive potential well possesses a zero-energy HBS, R(0) = 0 (R(0) << 1). This can happen only at some critical values q_c of an effective parameter q of the potential well in the limit E → 0 ^+. We demonstrate this critical phenomenon in two simple analytically solvable models which are square and <b>exponential</b> <b>wells.</b> However, in numerical calculations even for these two models R(0) = 0 is observed only as extrapolation to zero energy from low energies, close to a precise critical value q_c. By numerical investigation of a variety of potential wells, we conclude that for a given potential well (symmetric or asymmetric), we can adjust the effective parameter q to have a low reflection at a low energy.
