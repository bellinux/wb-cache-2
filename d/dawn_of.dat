5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from <b>Dawn</b> <b>of</b> Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as <b>Dawn</b> <b>of</b> Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E

5|$|While a few critics praised {{elements}} of its composition and execution, The <b>Dawn</b> <b>of</b> Love was very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty {{had developed a}} reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens {{as well as being}} overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. The <b>Dawn</b> <b>of</b> Love was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.|$|E
