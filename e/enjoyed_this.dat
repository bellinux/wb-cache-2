5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1988, the West Indies had {{experienced}} nearly ten years as the best Test team in world cricket, including a streak of winning 10 of 11 Test series they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> considerable recent success was beginning {{to show signs of}} ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were all coming to the end of their careers, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of pace bowlers. Supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg {{travelled}} to Algeria, {{touring the}} desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran {{on a daily}} basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this,</b> and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E

She starred alongside Markki Stroem, who played Shane Gray. The musical play was held at Onstage, Greenbelt 1, Makati City from November 16 until December 16. Amon <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> first stint in theater thoroughly, but using her voice at full tilt during rehearsals and the play itself took its toll. She started losing her voice after performances, prompting consultation with a doctor who diagnosed her with vocal cord nodules.|$|E
25|$|The 1887 {{constitution}} empowered {{the citizenry}} to elect {{members of the}} House of Nobles (who had previously been appointed by the King). It increased the value of property a citizen must own to be eligible to vote above the previous Constitution of 1864 and denied voting rights to Asians who comprised {{a large proportion of}} the population. (A few Japanese and some Chinese had previously become naturalized and now lost voting rights they had previously <b>enjoyed.)</b> <b>This</b> guaranteed a voting monopoly to wealthy native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Bayonet Constitution continued allowing the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.|$|E

25|$|Student unrest {{became a}} regular feature of Ethiopian {{life in the}} 1960s and 1970s. Marxism took root in large {{segments}} of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular {{in other parts of the}} globe. Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once <b>enjoyed.</b> <b>This</b> bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, Aklilu Habte Wold, and concentrated more on foreign affairs.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Herbert Davenport, {{a friend who was}} the head of the {{economics}} department at the University of Missouri, Veblen accepted a position there in 1911. Veblen’s stay at Missouri was not one that he <b>enjoyed.</b> <b>This</b> was in part due to the fact that his position as a lecturer was of lower rank than his previous positions and for lower pay. Veblen also strongly disliked the town of Columbia, where the university was located. Although he may not have enjoyed his stay at Missouri, in 1914 he did publish another of his best-known books, The Instincts of Worksmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914). After the First World War began, Veblen published Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915). He considered warfare a threat to economic productivity and contrasted the authoritarian politics of Germany with the democratic tradition of Britain, noting that industrialization in Germany had not produced a progressive political culture.|$|E
25|$|By 1996, the {{national}} economy had come under intense situation and deadlock, and an economic failure was soon near. The continuous and large scale of government corruption made by Benazir Bhutto and her appointed government ministers had deteriorated the country's economy at the extreme level. In the 1997 parliamentary elections, Sharif and his Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) won a landslide victory in the elections, defeating Benazir Bhutto and her People's party. Commenting on his victory, the Pakistan media {{and the people of}} Pakistan hoped that Sharif would provide a conservative but a stable government benefit for Pakistan as he promised earlier. Besides Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, no other leader, in the history of Pakistan, has enjoyed his level of popularity, and received the exclusive mandate from all over the Pakistan to improve the all over conditions in Pakistan at same time. As commentary, 1997 election resulted to boost Nawaz's popularity and was mandate onerous task to improve the country's economy. Nawaz defeated Benazir Bhutto with overwhelmingly voting numbers and it was the worst defeat of Bhutto and People's Party since its inception. After the elections, Nawaz arrived in Islamabad, where he met with large crowd of spontaneous and jubilant people supporting for Nawaz; it took more than 13 hours for Nawaz Sharif to reach Islamabad to take the oath. Sharif was sworn as prime minister in the early morning of on 17 February to serve a non-consecutive second term. With the passing of the 14th amendment, Sharif emerged as the most powerful elected prime minister in the country since its independence in 1947, and no other leader has <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> level of extreme popularity.|$|E

25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

This appearance made him a favourite of cartoonists generally, and Fender <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> fame, particularly the cartoons of Webster who drew Fender in a long sweater before he ever wore one; Fender then adopted [...] them to match his image. Similarly, he continued to wear glasses on the field after discovering {{that he did not}} need them.|$|E

Armstrong also said that [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] was in [...] "ER territory", adding: [...] "I do not watch Grey's Anatomy to get my ER fix." [...] Adam Bryant of TV Guide <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson.

500|$|In {{a letter}} to his brother dated 19March 1819, Keats {{discussed}} indolence as a subject.

During this period, Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher Richard Woodhouse. Keats wrote to his friend Sarah Jeffrey: [...] "he thing I have most <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> year has been writing an ode to Indolence." [...] Despite this enjoyment, however, he was not entirely satisfied with [...] "Ode on Indolence", and it remained unpublished until 1848.|$|E
500|$|Glen Morgan {{began writing}} the episode after he read a Science News article about men in Greenland who found a 250,000-year-old item encased in ice. The setting—an icy, remote {{research}} base overcome by an extraterrestrial creature—is {{similar to that}} of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There? and its two feature-film incarnations: The Thing from Another World (1951), directed by Christian Nyby and produced by Howard Hawks, and The Thing (1982), directed by John Carpenter. Chris Carter has cited them as the main inspirations for the episode. As in the novella and films, the characters cannot trust each other because they are uncertain if they are who they seem to be. Carter particularly <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> aspect, because it pitted Mulder and Scully against each other and provided [...] "a new look on their characters early on in the series".|$|E

Botkin was best man. Jack Manahan <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> marriage of convenience, and described himself as [...] "Grand Duke-in-Waiting" [...] or [...] "son-in-law to the Tsar".

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I <b>enjoyed</b> <b>this</b> tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E
