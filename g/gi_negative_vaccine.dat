30|$|Yeast {{proteins}} {{could be}} present as Saccharomyces cerevisiae derived antigens in hepatitis B vaccine (up to 25  mg/dose) and in quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (less than 7 mcg/dose) [39]. Yeast is also contained in pneumococcal 13 -valent conjugate (PCV- 13), in meningococcal and in oral thyphoid vaccines. Allergic reactions to yeasts proteins {{appear to be}} rare. In the US, in more than 180, 000 vaccine adverse reactions, only 15 were resulted from a reaction to yeast proteins. Furthermore, these 15 cases may have been even related to other vaccine components [45]. Although rare, in children with proven yeasts allergy, it is recommended to prefer yeast-free Vaccine (e.g. bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine). If not available, these children should be evaluated with skin prick tests and serum specific IgE dosage to Saccharomyces cerevisiae before vaccination. If an IgE sensitization is confirmed, children could receive graded vaccine; if <b>negative,</b> <b>vaccine</b> could be administered in the usual manner, with a 60  minutes observation after injection (Table  2).|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{dendritic}} cell (DCregs) -based immunotherapy {{is a potential}} therapeutic tool for transplant rejection. We generated DCregs from murine {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs), which could remain in a “stable immature stage” even under strong stimulation. Harnessing this characteristic, we hypothesized that iPS-DCregs worked as a <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> to generate regulatory T cells (Tregs), and induced donor-specific allograft acceptance. We immunized naive CBA (H- 2 Kk) mice with B 6 (H- 2 Kb) iPS-DCregs and found that Tregs (CD 4 +CD 25 +FOXP 3 +) significantly increased in CBA splenocytes. Moreover, immunized CBA recipients permanently accepted B 6 cardiac grafts in a donor-specific pattern. We demonstrated mechanistically that donor-type iPS-DCregs triggered transforming growth factor β 1 secretion, under which the donor-antigen peptides directed naive CD 4 + T cells to differentiate into donor-specific FOXP 3 + Tregs instead of into effector T cells in vivo. These findings highlight the potential of iPS-DCregs as a key cell therapy resource in clinical transplantation...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} in the dynamics of health behaviors in social networks and how they affect collective public health outcomes, but measuring population health behaviors over time and space requires substantial resources. Here, we use publicly available data from 101, 853 users of online social media collected over a time period of almost six months to measure the spatio-temporal sentiment towards a new vaccine. We validated our approach by identifying {{a strong correlation between}} sentiments expressed online and CDC- estimated vaccination rates by region. Analysis of the network of opinionated users showed that information flows more often between users who share the same sentiments - and less often between users who do not share the same sentiments - than expected by chance alone. We also found that most communities are dominated by either positive or negative sentiments towards the novel vaccine. Simulations of infectious disease transmission show that if clusters of <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> sentiments lead to clusters of unprotected individuals, the likelihood of disease outbreaks are greatly increased.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} transforming and obtaining transgenic cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L Walp) plants using the particle bombardment process. Meristematic explants that could give rise to whole fertile plants were used in transformation experiments with reporter and selectable marker genes driven by a 35 S CaMV promoter. Conditions for optimal delivery of DNA to explants were established based on transient gus expression assays two days after bombardment. The size of microcarriers, microflight distance and helium pressure significantly affected transient expression of reporter genes. A total of 1692 explants were bombarded with DNA-coated particles and placed on 3 mg/l bialaphos selective medium. Only 12 regenerated shoots produced seeds eventually, and all were <b>Gus</b> <b>negative</b> even though 7 gave positive PCR signals with the bar primer. Eight out of 1400 seeds from To plants were GUS positive. DNA from eight of the GUS positive seedlings were amplified with both the gus and bar primers in PCR analysis but only two gave a positive Southern signal. Only two of the 3557 T 2 seedlings obtained were GUS positive. However, 3 seedlings survived Basta spray. The two GUS positive and 3 Basta surviving seedlings gave positive Southern hybridisation signals. Twelve T 3 seedlings from these were GUS positive and also gave positive Southern hybridisation signals. The positive reaction of T 1, T 2 and T 3 seedlings under Southern analysis confirms the stable integration of introduced genes and the transfer of such genes to progenies. However, the level of expression of introduced genes in cowpea cells is very low and this accounted for the high mortality rate of progenies under Basta spray...|$|R

In Study 1, a sample of 585 parents with at least one child under the age of 18 in the home participated through Amazon's MTurk. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four conditions in a 2 x 2 design. Participants read either correcting information refuting a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism or a control passage about bird feeding. Additionally, participants either completed a self-affirmation exercise where they reflected on their personal values or in a control condition in which they reflected on least-personally-important values that might be important to others. Participants exposed to the correcting information were less likely to believe that vaccines cause serious side effects, but no less likely to believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism. For parents with initially positive vaccine attitudes, there was no effect of condition on intent to vaccinate a future child. For parents with initially <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> attitudes, self-affirmation was ineffective in the presence of correcting information and resulted in less intention to vaccinate in the absence of correcting information.

40|$|With {{approximately}} 3 {{billion people}} at risk of acquiring the infection, dengue fever is now considered the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, with 390 million dengue infections occurring every year, of which 96 million manifest symptoms with any level of disease severity. Treatment of uncomplicated dengue cases is only supportive and severe dengue cases require hospital intensive care. A vaccine now licensed in several countries and developed by Sanofi Pasteur (CYD-TDV, named Dengvaxia), was able to protect, in the first 25 months of the two Phase III, 66 % of a subset of 9 - 16 year old participants. However, a significantly lower efficacy (including <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy) was noted for children younger than 9 years of age. Analysis of year 3 results of phase III trials of Dengvaxia suggest high rates of protection of vaccinated partial dengue immunes but high rates of hospitalizations during breakthrough dengue infections of persons who were vaccinated when seronegative, with vaccine appearing to induce enhancing antibodies (ADE). An age structured model was developed based on Sanofi's recommendation to vaccinate persons age 945 years in dengue endemic countries. The model was used to explore the clinical burden of two vaccination strategies: 1) Vaccinate 4 or 20 % of individuals, ages 9 - 45 years, seropositives and seronegatives, and 2) vaccinate 4 or 20 % of individuals, ages 9 - 45 years, who are dengue immune only.

40|$|Inclusion {{of vaccine}} herd-protection effects in {{cost-effectiveness}} analyses (CEAs) can impact the CEAs-conclusions. However, empirical epidemiologic {{data on the}} size of herd-protection effects from original studies are limited. We performed a quantitative comparative analysis of the impact of herd-protection effects in CEAs for four childhood vaccinations (pneumococcal, meningococcal, rotavirus and influenza). We considered CEAs reporting incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratios (ICERs) (per quality-adjusted-life-years [QALY] gained; per life-years [LY] gained or per disability-adjusted-life-years [DALY] avoided), both with and without herd protection, while keeping all other model parameters stable. We calculated the size of the ICER-differences without vs with-herd-protection and estimated how often inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of the cost-effectiveness threshold (of an assumed societal-willingness-to-pay) of $ 50, 000 for more-developed countries or X 3 GDP/capita (WHO-threshold) for less-developed countries. We identified 35 CEA studies (20 pneumococcal, 4 meningococcal, 8 rotavirus and 3 influenza vaccines) with 99 ICER-analyses (55 per-QALY, 27 per-LY and 17 per-DALY). The median ICER-absolute differences per QALY, LY and DALY (without minus with herd-protection) were $ 15, 620 (IQR: $ 877 to $ 48, 376); $ 54, 871 (IQR: $ 787 to $ 115, 026) and $ 49 (IQR: $ 15 to $ 1, 636) respectively. When the target-vaccination strategy was not cost-saving without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection always resulted in more favorable results. In CEAs that had ICERs above the cost-effectiveness threshold without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of that threshold in 45 % of the cases. This impacted only CEAs for more developed countries, as all but one CEAs for less developed countries had ICERs below the WHO-cost-effectiveness threshold even without herd-protection. In several analyses, recommendation for the adoption of the target vaccination strategy depended on the inclusion of the herd protection effect. Inclusion of herd-protection effects in CEAs had a substantial impact in the estimated ICERs and made target-vaccination strategies more attractive options in almost half of the cases where ICERs were above the societal-willingness to pay threshold without herd-protection. More empirical epidemiologic data are needed to determine the size of herd-protection effects across diverse settings and also the size of <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> effects, e. g. from serotype substitution...|$|R

Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among MSM and TG persons (N = 176) recruited from community settings in Atlanta from 2007 to 2008. The first group was recruited during an active phase 2 B HIV vaccine trial in which a candidate vaccine was being evaluated (the &ldquo;Step Study&rdquo;), and the second group was recruited after product futility was widely reported in the media. Methods: Descriptive statistics, t tests, and chi-square tests were conducted to ascertain differences between the groups, and ordinal logistic regressions examined the influences of the above-mentioned factors on a critical outcome, future HIV vaccine study participation. The ordinal regression outcomes evaluated the influences on disinclination, neutrality, and inclination to study participation. Results: Behavioral outcomes such as future recruitment, event attendance, study promotion, and community mobilization did not reveal any differences in participants&rsquo; intentions between the groups. However, we observed greater interest in HIV vaccine study screening (t = 1. 07, P &lt; 0. 05) and enrollment (t = 1. 15, P &lt; 0. 05) following <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> findings. Means on perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs did not differ between the groups. Before this development, only beliefs exhibited a strong relationship on the enrollment intention (&beta; = 2. 166, P = 0. 002). However, the effect disappeared following negative trial results, with the positive assessment of the study-site perceptions being the only significant contributing factor on enrollment intentions (&beta; = 1. 369, P = 0. 011). Conclusion: Findings show greater enrollment intention among this population in the wake of negative efficacy findings from the Step Study. The resolve of this community to find an HIV vaccine is evident. Moreover, any exposure to information disseminated in the public arena did not appear to negatively influence the potential for future participation in HIV vaccine studies among this population.

The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the cell envelope virulence associated genes of B. melitensis strains in Palestine. A total of 80 non-repetitive B. melitensis isolates were obtained from milk samples collected from infected small ruminants in the northern districts of the West Bank, Palestine during 2013 and 2015.

40|$|Transplantation is {{the best}} form of {{treatment}} for end-stage kidney disease, by improving quality of life, reducing mortality and lowering healthcare costs. However, the immunosuppressive medications required have non-selective mechanisms of action, affecting both patient and graft longevity. Tolerance, the acceptance of an allograft {{in the absence of}} immunosuppression, remains a major goal in clinical transplantation research. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) capable of promoting anti-donor immunity and antigen-specific tolerance, and are a promising target for immunomodulation. Current tolerogenic techniques involve ex vivo DC manipulation which limits immediate clinical applicability. The scope of this thesis involves identification of a novel biologic agent, curcumin, to induce tolerogenic DC and the use of this immunomodulatory agent within a liposomal construct to target and modify DC function in vivo. Chapter 1 discusses the context of this thesis and contains a comprehensive literature review. Chapter 2 outlines methodology and materials utilised in this thesis. Chapter 3 demonstrates the use of curcumin for in vitro generation of tolerogenic DC that promote expansion of functional FoxP 3 + regulatory T-cells (Tregs). In vivo infusion of curcumin-treated DC was also able to induce subsequent immune hyporesponsiveness mediated by FoxP 3 + Tregs, and represents a potential avenue for transplant recipient conditioning using donor (or recipient) -derived DC. Chapter 4 demonstrates the use of liposomes to target APC in vivo. Liposomal incorporation of immunomodulatory agents facilitates targeted cellular delivery to tissue-resident APC and forms a basis for in vivo modulation of APC function. This work demonstrates that the in vitro results demonstrated in Chapter 3 can be replicated in vivo, potentially eliminating the need for ex vivo DC manipulation in a transplant setting. Chapter 5 demonstrates the utility of liposomal curcumin in ameliorating aspects of ischaemiareperfusion injury (IRI), a consequence of transplant surgery that promotes graft immunogenicity and limits graft longevity. For the first time renal tubular epithelial and antigen-presenting cell endocytosis of liposomes is demonstrated, as is salvage of renal function which is mediated by reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and diminished oxidative stress. The results also identify thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as a potential novel marker of tissue injury in IRI, and curcumin effectively reduces this aspect of cellular redox stress These data represent a novel and effective delivery method for this immunmodulatory agent, preventing significant renal damage in a manner that has immediate clinical applicability. Chapter 6 describes a refinement in liposomal targeting of DC, using a DC-specific liposome capable of binding to human monocyte-derived DC with high affinity via the receptor DCSIGN. The gene for marmoset DC-SIGN was cloned and the cross-reactivity of a human-DC-targeted liposome to its marmoset counterpart was investigated in vitro. Additional attempts were made to synthesize a marmoset DC-targeted liposome through basic, non-specific, chemical modification of a monoclonal antibody to DC-SIGN known to be cross-reactive with both humans and marmosets, with the aim of creating a cell-free DC-targeted <b>negative</b> <b>vaccine</b> that could be tested in non-human primates. Thus, the work presented in this thesis creates a platform for future studies from which DC-based cellular and cell-free immune tolerance therapies can be developed in a transplant model. Thesis (Ph.

We carried out a postal questionnaire survey of people aged 65 years and over living in the community to explore views about influenza vaccine and identify ways of improving uptake. Completed questionnaires were returned by 1468 / 2553 (57. 5 %). Vaccine coverage for 1998 – 1999 season was 50. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 47. 9 – 53. 1 %). Important predictor variables for non-uptake included absence of medical risk factors, perceived good health, lack of advice from a doctor or nurse, and <b>negative</b> views on <b>vaccine</b> efficacy and safety. Most people had to request vaccination, only one in five got a reminder from their general practitioner. There is scope for improving influenza vaccine coverage in older people by placing more emphasis in patient information materials on vaccine efficacy and safety and by greater use of reminders...|$|R
40|$|Background: Heptavalent pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV 7) shifts nasopharyngeal colonisation with vaccine serotype pneumococci towards nonvaccine serotypes. Because of {{the reported}} <b>negative</b> association of <b>vaccine</b> serotype pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus in the nasopharynx, we explored the effect of PCV 7 on nasopharyngeal colonisation with S. aureus in children and parents. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study {{was part of a}} randomised controlled trial on the effect of PCV 7 on pneumococcal carriage, enrolling healthy newborns who were randomly assigned (1 : 1 : 1) to receive PCV 7 (1) at 2 and 4 months of age (2) at 2, 4 and 11 months or (3) no PCV 7 (controls). Nasopharyngeal colonisation of S. aureus was a planned secondary outcome. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from all children over a 2 -year period with 6 -months interval and from one parent at the child’s age of 12 and 24 months and cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus.

Brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that replicates within macrophages. Recent reports showed that certain cell envelope associated genes of the B. melitensis is associated with its environmental stress adaptation and intracellular survival. Identification and characterization of these genes are essential to implementing efficient disease control and prevention systems. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the cell envelope virulence associated genes of B. melitensis strains in Palestine. A total of 80 non-repetitive B. melitensis isolates were obtained from milk samples collected from infected small ruminants in the northern districts of the West Bank, Palestine during 2013 and 2015. The milk were cultured on Brucella agar (Oxoid) then incubated at 37 ͼC for 3 to 7 days. Positive cultures were identified by standard biochemical methods and confirmed by IS 711 and Rev 1 rpsL gene PCR. All samples were <b>negative</b> for <b>vaccine</b> strain Rev 1 rpsL gene-PCR. The 80 B. melitensis under investigation were tested by multiplex PCR for 19 cell envelope virulence associated genes. Interestingly, our results revealed that all the 80 isolates were positive for the following genes: lpsB, lpsA rfbD, wbpL, pgm omp 19, omp 25, omp 10, mgtA, uppS, amiC and dacF, while the other genes: wbdA, wbpZ, pmm, wbkA, perA, manB and wpbW were detected in more than 95 % of the isolates...|$|R

In {{order to protect}} the neonatal lambs and kids from orf infection a commercially available live orf vaccine was used. Pregnant sheep and goats were vaccinated subcutaneously a month before parturition, while 10 sheep and 10 goats in each flock remained unvaccinated and were used as <b>negative</b> controls. The <b>vaccine</b> was significantly effective (P< 0. 05) in reducing the orf lesions and the mortality rate in lambs and kids of the 4 flocks. During the next year 3 of the 4 flocks were revaccinated. A significantly low percentage of orf lesions and neonatal mortality continued to occur in revaccinated flocks, while a significant percentage (P< 0. 05) of orf lesions and neonatal mortality reappeared in the nonrevaccinated flock.

Vaccine safety was evaluated by intranasal inoculation of two groups of goats with either a gE-negative BoHV- 1 vaccine or a virulent BoHV- 1. The length of viral excretion and the peak viral titre were reduced with the gE-negative vaccine. To assess the efficacy, two goats were inoculated intranasally twice 2 weeks apart with a gE-negative BoHV- 1 vaccine. Four weeks later, immunised and control goats were challenged with CpHV- 1. A 2 log(10) reduction in the peak viral titre was observed and the challenge virus excretion lasted 2 days more in immunised than in control goats. These data indicate the safety and the partial efficacy of a live attenuated gE-negative BoHV- 1 vaccine intranasally administrated in goats. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The vaccinal {{antibodies}} interference {{represents one}} of the Microscopic Agglutination test - MAT limitation in the animal leptospirosis serum diagnosis. Prospective studies showing the dimensions of this effect are rare in buffaloes. This study aimed to determine the anti-Leptospira serum agglutinin profile in vaccinated female buffaloes using two types of commercial vaccines against leptospirosis: bacterin (whole bacterial cell) and purified outer membrane and to evaluate the vaccinal interference on serum diagnosis. Three groups of 11 adult buffalo females were established: G 1 -control, non-vaccinated, G 2 - vaccinated with bacterin vaccine with six serovars, G 3 - outer membrane purified vaccine with five serovars. A booster dose was administrated 30 days after the first vaccination (dpv) and two re-vaccinations six months a part (210 and 390 dpv). Serum samples were collected on days 0, 15, 40, 45, 60 and every 30 days until 540 dpv. G 1, G 2 and G 3 serum samples were submitted to MAT with the serovars present in the vaccines. G 1 remained always <b>negative.</b> Both <b>vaccines</b> induced serologic responses in MAT at 150 dpv against all serovars and they revealed maximum titers around 45 and 60 dpv as follows: Pomona: G 2 (1600) and G 3 (3200); Hardjo: G 2 and G 3 (1600); Wolffi: G 2 (800) and G 3 (1600); Icterohaemorrhagiae: G 2 and G 3 (800); Grippotyphosa: G 2 and G 3 (200) and Canicola: G 2 (NR) and G 3 (400). Even though, the Wolffi serovar is not present in the purified outer membrane vaccine, G 3 showed a response to that serovar, probably due to cross reaction to the serovar Hardjo. The G 3 titers were higher and appeared earlier than in G 2, but with similar serologic profiles. At the re-vaccination there was an increase on agglutinin levels, but of less intensity than those previously observed. After six months from the second revaccination (540 dfv), G 2 and G 3 were almost negative, which demonstrated the short diagnostic interference...|$|R
40|$|The {{brucellin}} {{skin test}} and the lymphocyte transformation test were compared in heifers infected with virulent Brucella abortus strain 544, heifers vaccinated against brucellosis and unexposed cattle. Results of the in vitro lymphocyte transformation test were consistently positive for all 9 Brucella-infected heifers while the skin test was consistently positive for 6 of the 9 heifers. In 7 heifers repeatedly vaccinated with B. abortus strain- 19 vaccine the in vitro test classified 3 animals as positive whereas the skin test identified all the animals as infected {{during most of the}} experimental period. Four heifers injected with a single dose of B. abortus strain 19 were consistently negative to the lymphocyte transformation test while the skin test classified all the animals as infected during most of the experimental period. The skin test gave strong reactions indicative of Brucella infection in heifers vaccinated with 'Duphavac' and 'Abortox' vaccines whereas the lymphocyte transformation test was consistently <b>negative</b> with these <b>vaccines.</b> The two tests were negative in unexposed cattle. It was concluded that the in vitro test correlated better with Brucella isolation than the in vivo test did and that the lack of agreement between the results of the two tests is likely to be due to the different antigens used in the assays...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the global}} spread of {{pandemic}} influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009, several pandemic vaccines have been rapidly developed. The United Kingdom {{and many other}} countries in the northern hemisphere implemented seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine programmes in October 2009. We present the results of a case–control study to estimate effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing confirmed pandemic influenza infection. Some 5, 982 individuals with influenza-like illness seen in general practices between November 2009 and January 2010 were enrolled. Those testing positive on PCR for pandemic influenza were assigned as cases and those testing <b>negative</b> as controls. <b>Vaccine</b> effectiveness was estimated as the relative reduction in odds of confirmed infection between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Fourteen or more days after immunisation with the pandemic vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 72 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 21 % to 90 %). If protection was assumed to start after seven or more days, the adjusted VE was 71 % (95 % CI: 37 % to 87 %). Pandemic influenza vaccine was highly effective in preventing confirmed infection with pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 from one week after vaccination. No evidence of effectiveness against pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 was found for the 2009 / 10 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (adjusted VE of - 30 % (95 % CI: - 89 % to 11 %)) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dendritic}} cell (DC) -based tumor immunotherapy {{has been a}} new promise of cure for cancer patients, but animal studies and clinical trials have thus far only shown limited success, especially in treating established tumors. Certain immunosuppressive mechanisms triggered by tumor cells or the derivatives {{are believed to be}} a major obstacle. We studied the role of DC-derived IL- 10 and its <b>negative</b> impact on <b>vaccine</b> efficacy in mouse models. Liver tumor cells were injected via the portal vein, giving rise to disseminated intrahepatic tumors, or s. c. to form solid but extrahepatic tumors. Bone marrow-derived DCs were generated from normal or IL- 10 -deficient mice and used as the vector to deliver tumor Ags. We demonstrate here that DCs devoid of IL- 10, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, are superior over conventional DCs in triggering antitumor immunity. The IL- 10 -/-DCs were highly immunogenic, expressed enhanced levels of surface MHC class II molecules, and secreted increased amounts of Th 1 -related cytokines. By inducing tumor-specific killing and through the establishment of immunological memory, the vaccines delivered by IL- 10 -/-DCs could evoke strong therapeutic and protective immunity against hepatocellular carcinoma in the mouse models. These findings will have great clinical impact once being translated into the treatment of malignant, and potentially infectious, diseases in humans.

30|$|Yellow fever vaccine - Yellow fever is {{an acute}} viral disease caused by Flavivirus and {{transmitted}} by {{the bite of}} mosquito (Aedes Aegypti). It is endemic in South America and Africa and has an high mortality. Yellow fever vaccination is, therefore, required for traveling in endemic countries. Yellow fever vaccine is grown in chicken embryos and contains higher amounts of egg-proteins in comparison with MMR and influenza vaccines. Unlike influenza and MMR vaccines, all subjects with egg-allergy and previous systemic reactions should receive yellow fever vaccine under hospital supervision. Patients with egg allergy should be evaluated before vaccination, with skin prick test and serum specific IgE to eggs [39]. When there is an history of anaphylaxis to egg, it may be performed a skin prick test with a 1 / 10 dilution of <b>vaccine,</b> and, if <b>negative,</b> with undiluted <b>vaccine.</b> If skin prick tests are negative, an intradermal test should be performed with a 1 / 100 dilution (1 / 10 dilution has been demonstrated to be irritative) [39]. If all skin tests are nega-tive, vaccine could be normally administered, with a 60  minutes post-vaccine observation (Table  2). If skin tests are positive, vaccine should be injected in graded dose under hospital supervision. It has been demonstrated that an intradermal 1 / 5 dose of vaccine could be protective and safe in egg allergy subjects who have shown a severe local urticaria reactions [40].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe major {{challenge}} in influenza vaccination is to predict vaccine efficacy. The {{purpose of this}} study was to design a model to enable successful prediction of the outcome of influenza vaccination based on real historical medical data. A non-linear neural network approach was used, and its performance compared to logistic regression. The three neural network algorithms were tested: multilayer perceptron, radial basis and probabilistic in conjunction with parameter optimization and regularization techniques in order to create an influenza vaccination model that could be used for prediction purposes in the medical practice of primary health care physicians, where the vaccine is usually dispensed. The selection of input variables was based on a model of the vaccine strain which has frequently been changed and on which a poor influenza vaccine response is expected. The performance of models was measured by the average hit rate of <b>negative</b> and positive <b>vaccine</b> outcome. In order to test the generalization ability of the models, a 10 -fold cross-validation procedure revealed that the model obtained by multilayer perceptron produced the highest average hit rate among neural network algorithms, and also outperformed the logistic regression model with regard to sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the best model and the importance of input variables was discussed. Further research should focus on improving the performance of the model by combining neural networks with other intelligent methods in this field...|$|R
40|$|Immunisation with Amastigote Surface Protein 2 (asp- 2) and trans-sialidase (ts) genes induces {{protective}} immunity {{in highly}} susceptible A/Sn mice, against infection with parasites of the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. Based on immunological and biological strain variations in T. cruzi parasites, {{our goal was}} to validate our vaccination results using different parasite strains. Due to the importance of the CD 8 (+) T cells in protective immunity, we initially determined which strains expressed the immunodominant H- 2 K(k) -restricted epitope TEWETGQI. We tested eight strains, four of which elicited immune responses to this epitope (Y, G, Colombian and Colombia). We selected the Colombian and Colombia strains for our studies. A/Sn mice were immunised with different regimens using both T. cruzi genes (asp- 2 and ts) simultaneously and subsequently challenged with blood trypomastigotes. Immune responses before the challenge were confirmed by the presence of specific antibodies and peptide-specific T cells. Genetic vaccination did not confer protective immunity against acute infection with a lethal dose of the Colombian strain. In contrast, we observed a drastic reduction in parasitemia and a significant increase in survival, following challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of the Colombia strain. In many surviving animals with late-stage chronic infection, we observed alterations in the heart's electrical conductivity, compared to naive mice. In summary, we concluded that immunity against T. cruzi antigens, similar to viruses and bacteria, may be strain-specific and have a <b>negative</b> impact on <b>vaccine</b> development...|$|R
