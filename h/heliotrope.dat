25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, <b>heliotrope,</b> and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E

[...] The perfume is a blend of the aromas of hyacinth, white freesia, fresh pear, violet, jasmine, rose, lily, sweet pea, orange blossom, peach, frangipani, <b>heliotrope</b> and musk.

500|$|The Sex Pistols reunited {{for five}} {{performances}} in the UK in 2007. In 2008, they undertook a series of European festival appearances, titled the Combine Harvester Tour. In August, after performing at the Dutch festival A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise, Lowlands director Eric van Eerdenburg declared the Pistols' performance [...] "saddening": [...] "They left their swimming pools at home only to scoop up some money here. Really, they're nothing more than that." [...] That same year, they released the DVD There'll Always Be An England, recorded at their Brixton Academy appearance on 10 November 2007. In 2010, Fragrance and Beauty Limited announced the release of an authorised Sex Pistols scent. According to {{a statement from the}} cosmetics firm, [...] "the fragrance exudes pure energy, pared down and pumped up by leather, shot through with <b>heliotrope</b> and brought back down to earth by a raunchy patchouli." [...] The band signed with Universal Music Group in 2012 to re-release Never Mind the Bollocks.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, [...] "I wanted [...] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [...] Black Star won the 2010 Best [...] "Women's Scent Mass" [...] by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, <b>heliotrope,</b> shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's [...] "follow your dreams", though the tagline for the new perfume is [...] "Dare to Discover". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is [...] "Dare to discover more". It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.|$|E

2500|$|Beach naupaka (Scaevola taccada) is {{the most}} common shrub on Kiritimati; beach naupaka scrub dominates the {{vegetation}} on much of the island, either as pure stands or interspersed with tree <b>heliotrope</b> (Heliotropium foertherianum) and bay cedar (Suriana maritima). The latter species is dominant on the drier parts of the lagoon flats where it grows up to [...] tall. Tree <b>heliotrope</b> is most commonly found a short distance from the sea- or lagoon-shore. In some places near the seashore, a low vegetation dominated by Polynesian <b>heliotrope</b> (Heliotropium anomalum), yellow purslane (Portulaca lutea) and common purslane (P. oleracea) is found. In the south and on the sandier parts, Sida fallax, also growing up to 2 m tall, is abundant. On the southeastern peninsula, S. fallax grows more stunted, and Polynesian <b>heliotrope,</b> yellow and common purslane as well as the spiderling Boerhavia repens, the parasitic vine Cassytha filiformis, and Pacific Island thintail (Lepturus repens) supplement it. The last species dominates in the coastal grasslands. The wetter parts of the lagoon shore are often covered by abundant growth of shoreline purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum).|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} distinction between types of quartz {{is that of}} macrocrystalline (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties (aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite. Other opaque gemstone varieties of quartz, or mixed rocks including quartz, often including contrasting bands or patterns of color, are agate, carnelian or sard, onyx, [...] <b>heliotrope,</b> and jasper.|$|E

The understory typically comprises beach maupaka (Scaevola taccada), or sparse endemic bunchgrass, ihi (Portulaca molokiniensis), ilima (Sida fallax), or alena (Boerhavia herbstii), the latter being more abundant on broken coral gravel. A small stand of Pisonia grandis is found on Kamwome Islet and in another very small stand on Sibylla.|$|E

On the subject, Numsuwankijkul said [...] "I remember being like, “Oh, we wish she was in our band” and then a year later, she was." [...] Nya Abudu answered the advert on Craigslist and the line-up was complete. They began to form their sound, instead of playing Eno-style songs. In 2010, the band self-released an EP titled III. In 2011, they signed to Manimal Vinyl and released their debut single, [...] "Ribbons", on 7" [...] vinyl.
