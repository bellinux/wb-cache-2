50|$|Unlike solar or galactic cosmic rays, {{little is}} known about the origins of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> This is largely due to a lack of statistics: only about 1 extragalactic cosmic ray {{particle}} per square meter per year reaches the Earth's surface (see figure).There are many ideas about which processes may be responsible for cosmic rays with such high energies. In the 'bottom-up' approach, cosmic rays gain more and more energy through electromagnetic processes. Bouncing randomly back and forth in the shock waves of some violent object allows some of the particles to gain energy. Eventually they may build up enough speed that the object can no longer contain them, and they escape. Proposed sites for this type of acceleration include gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Indeed, recent analysis of cosmic ray measurements with the Pierre Auger Observatory suggests a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays of the highest energies of more than 5×1019 eV and the positions of nearby active galaxies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the cosmic {{radiation}} has been a mystery since its discovery by Victor Hess in 1912. The cosmic-ray energy spectrum extends from a few GeV to above 1020 eV. As {{yet there is no}} experimental proof of the transition from Galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> though it is believed that cosmic rays below about 1017.5 eV are of Galactic origin. While there is a consensus that supernovae (SN) explosions accelerate cosmic rays up to energies of ~1015 eV, experimental evidence has been difficult to obtain. The theoretical arguments are based upon the energy released in SN being sufficient to maintain the observed cosmic rays in the Galaxy, and the creation of strong shocks by SN enabling first order Fermi acceleration. Thus the tasks for future experiments are to confirm that supernovae are sites of the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays up to the knee, and to determine the sources of the Galactic cosmic rays above 1015 eV.|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1969, Donald Lynden-Bell wrote a paper {{suggesting}} that [...] "dead quasars" [...] {{were found at}} the center of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies by arguing that given the quasar-number counts, luminosities, distances, and the efficiency of accretion into a [...] "Schwarzschild throat" [...] through the last stable circular orbit (note that the term black hole had been coined only two years earlier and was still gaining popular usage), roughly 1010 quasars existed in the observable universe. This number density of [...] "dead quasars" [...] was attributed by Lynden-Bell to high mass-to-light ratio objects found {{at the center of}} galaxies. This is essentially the Sołtan argument, though the direct connection between black hole masses and quasar luminosity functions is missing. In the paper, Lynden-Bell also suggests some radical ideas that are now fully integrated into modern understanding of astrophysics including the model that accretion disks are supported by magnetic fields, that <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> are accelerated in them, and he estimates to within an order of magnitude the masses of several of the closest supermassive black holes including the ones in the Milky Way, M31, M32, M81, M82, M87, and NGC 4151.|$|E

40|$|Extragalactic cosmic ray protons with an {{injection}} {{spectrum of the}} type E − 2. 7 show a spectrum on earth with a dip due to the Bethe-Heitler pair production against the photons of the cosmic microwave background. The dip is produced in the energy region 10 18 − 4 × 10 19 eV with position and shape that reproduce with high accuracy the spectrum observed experimentally. This interpretation of the observed data predicts {{the existence of an}} energy scale that signals a possible transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> In fact, at energies lower than a characteristic value Ec ≈ 1 × 10 18 eV, determined by the equality between the rate of energy losses due to pair production and adiabatic losses, the spectrum of cosmic rays flattens in all cases of interest. In this model, the transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> occurs at some energy below Ec, corresponding to the position of the so-called second knee. Another viable explanation of the observed data is based on a completely different approach assuming a mixed composition with protons and nuclei at energies E ≥ 10 19 eV. This scenario implies a transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> at the ankle energies (∼ 10 19 eV). In the present paper we will review the main features of the dip model comparing it with the model of transition at the ankle. ...|$|E
40|$|The energy region {{spanning}} from ∼ 10 ^ 17 to ≲ 10 ^ 19 eV {{is critical}} for understanding both, the Galactic and the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> fluxes.

In this work, a diffusion Galactic model is used to analyze the end of the Galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> spectrum and its mixing with the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux. In particular, we study the conditions that must be met, from the spectral and composition points of view, by the Galactic and the extragalactic fluxes in order to reproduce simultaneously the total spectrum and elongation rate measured over the transition region by HiRes and Auger. Our analysis favors a mixed extragalactic spectrum in combination with a Galactic spectrum enhanced by additional high energy components, i. e., extending beyond the maximum energies expected from regular supernova remnants. The two additional components have mixed composition, with the lowest energy one heavier than the highest energy one.

Given the current age of galaxies, our results indicate that, in reasonable models, a completely negligible number of particles can enter our Galaxy from distances greater than ∼ 100 Mpc for relatively low energies (E < 10 ^ 6 GeV/n).
