50|$|After {{the final}} {{shutdown}} in December 1969, the reactor {{was left in}} standby for nearly a year. A limited examination program was then carried out, including a moderator bar from the core, a control rod thimble, heat exchanger tubes, parts from the <b>fuel</b> pump <b>bowl,</b> and a freeze valve that had developed a leak during the final reactor shutdown. The radioactive systems were then closed to await ultimate disposal.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the <b>fuel</b> <b>bowls</b> of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|R
50|$|Mixer {{operation}} is simple, it contains only one moving part, {{that being the}} needle valve. While there are exceptions, a mixer doesn't store <b>fuel</b> in a <b>bowl</b> of any kind. Fuel is simply fed to the mixer, where due {{to the effect of}} Bernoulli's principle, it is self-metered in the venturi created below the weighted piston by the action of the attached needle valve, the method used to this day in the SU carburetor.|$|R
50|$|Its leaky <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl.</b> As {{in nearly}} all carburetors, the Quadrajet's bowl had pressed-in plugs used to seal holes left after {{drilling}} fuel passages during the manufacturing of the carburetor. These plugs in the Q-jet sometimes leaked fuel causing difficult cold-engine starting, erratic idling, poor fuel mileage, and excessive emissions. Many Quadrajets have their <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl</b> plugs sealed with epoxy when rebuilt to prevent leaks.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of rare misfire and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection optical engine. Spark discharge energy, discharge duration, flame imaging, velocity and equivalence ratio were measured every crank angle degree. Imaging was performed using high-speed 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser inducted fluorescence (PLIF). The engine was operated near its optimum but produced rare and random partial burn and misfire cycles. Spark energy and spark duration for the partial burn and misfire cycles fell {{within the range}} of those for the well-burned cycles, with a slight bias toward low-energy, short-duration discharges, indicating no abnormal spark discharge events. PIV and PLIF measurements extracted from a 4 mm _ 4 mm region adjacent to and downstream of the spark plug at spark timing revealed that the partial burn and misfire cycles occur under lean mixtures and low velocities, but still {{within the range of}} values for the well-burned cycles. PIV and PLIF images of partial burn and misfire cycles were compared to well-burned cycles, which had similar velocities and equivalence ratios near the spark plug at the onset of spark. Observations of the fuel distribution and flame areas for the partial burns and misfires showed that an early flame kernel was always formed, but failed to develop sufficiently to propagate to the <b>fuel</b> in the <b>bowl.</b> A flame kernel arriving late within the piston bowl found significantly leaner conditions and the mixture was not fully consumed leading to a partial burn. For misfire cycles, the mixture in the measurement plane was significantly leaner surrounding the flame kernel, which disappeared shortly after the spark discharge. It is concluded that the partial burns and misfires are not the result of failed ignition, but failure during the flame propagation process...|$|R

The innovative air-oil design of 1985 was simply {{no longer able to}} provide enough cooling for the power the engine was putting out, now a claimed 118 hp. The weight of the previous year, 458 lbs, was maintained while adding the water cooling.Also to be noted this was the last year of the [...] "Power Jet" [...] which came stock on the carburetors since 1989.

Basic function of the power jet was the smooth out fuel delivery from 9.5k- 10k rpm all the way to the rev limiter.However, these jets were blanked out on the US models but were fully functional for Canadian buyers and other countries. The water cooled bikes would not be available to the US until 1993.|$|E

40|$|Oil spill cleanup in Arctic {{is usually}} done by in-situ burning. The fuel oil {{will have a}} very low initial {{temperature}} as well as cold boundaries. This study focuses on the variation of the mass burning rate of the fuel with varying initial temperatures of the fuel, which is kept in a metal bowl surrounded by ice. Kerosene is chosen as the fuel. The bowl diameters have been varied from 30 mm to around 50 mm. The <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl</b> is kept surrounded in an ice bath and is ignited after it attains a particular temperature. The initial temperature of the fuel is varied from 4 o C to 16 o C. Experiments are carried out for 5 minutes after which the flame is quenched. The results show that with increase in the initial temperature of the fuel the mass burning rate also increases. The mass burning rate also increases as the <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl</b> diameter increases. The surface temperature of the fuel, just after quenching, increases with an increase in the initial temperature of the fuel. The ignition time of the fuel is reduced with increase in initial temperature of the fuel and with increase in bowl diameter. The flame height variations are also recorded.

40|$|The current Space Shuttle Main Engine hot-gas {{manifold}} configuration contains three transfer ducts connecting the <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl</b> {{and the main}} injector torus. For the current study, a new hot-gas manifold was designed to improve on a previously tested two-duct concept.

The two-duct hot-gas manifold tested in this study showed significant improvement over the existing three-duct design. The circumferential pressure gradient was reduced by 67 percent. The system total pressure loss from the discharge of the 180 -degree turn to the transfer duct exit was 60 percent less than with the three duct hot gas manifold.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study using}} an inviscid three-dimensional Lagrangian fluid dynamics code {{has been conducted}} {{as a part of}} an overall effort to understand the flow behavior in the SSME fuel side hot-gas manifold. The model simulates flow from the high-pressure fuel turbine exit through the transfer ducts, including the effects of swirl, inlet flow symmetry, and presence of straightening vanes and struts; a separate, more-detailed effort is in progress that includes viscosity and turbulence effects. The simplified model presented is divided into two parts, the first includes the 180 -degree turnaround duct downstream of the turbine exit and the spherical <b>fuel</b> <b>bowl</b> section, while the second models the three transfer ducts. The two parts of the model are coupled together with the interface conditions being updated through iteration. Results indicate that a transverse pressure differential of 165 psi would be imposed on the turbine exit and that unstable flow separation occurs around the vanes, struts, and within the transfer ducts. The three transfer ducts show a mass flux split of approximately 41, 21, and 38 percent. Results to date are encouraging that certain flow characteristics can be usefuly represented using a relatively coarse grid inviscid code...|$|E
