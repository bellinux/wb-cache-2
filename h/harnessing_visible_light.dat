40|$|By {{converting}} {{natural light}} energy into chemical energy, chemists are studying ways {{to take advantage}} of clean energy. The rising precedence of “green chemistry” has led to academic interest in the activity of photocatalysts and <b>harnessing</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> in an efficient, accessible, and safe manner. Photochemistry is an upcoming and fascinating field of study that has made significant progress, but also has great potential for future work. By utilizing light as a natural energy source, many reaction processes in chemistry can be viewed with a new perspective. Ru(bpy) 32 + {{is one of the most}} widely used photocatalysts. An efficient charge separation in its photoexcited state is critical for successful electron transfer between the photoexcited ruthenium complex and the substrate. However, the charge separation only has a lifetime of 200 nanoseconds. In order to prolong the lifetime of Ru(bpy) 32 +, I will be experimenting with a ligand alteration of the ruthenium complex. The approach is to attach a Quinone to one of the bipyridine ligands. The Quinone group functions as an electron acceptor to oxidize the photoexcited bipyridine ligand, and therefore create a different type of relay that can prolong the charge separation’s lifetime. Overall, the appendage of the unique Quinone ligand to one of the bipyridine ligands may be able to significantly increase the lifetime and catalytic efficiency of Ru(bpy) 32 +...|$|E

The results strongly confirm the chemisorption of Hemin molecules on the TiO 2 surface through O&z. dbd;C-O-Ti bonds.

40|$|Conversion {{of solar}} energy to {{storable}} chemical energy has received considerable {{interest in the}} past decade due to the limited availability of fossil fuels and concerns on environmental sustainability. One of the important processes involved in producing alternative fuels by utilizing solar energy is solar water splitting. One of the challenges in solar water splitting is to identify a semiconductor material that is capable to absorb major portion of the solar spectrum and possesses proper band edge potentials to simultaneously oxidize and reduce water. An alternative approach to the direct solar water splitting is photoelectrochemical solar water splitting, which physically separates the photoanode from photocathode for water oxidation and reduction, respectively, allowing each electrode to be independently optimized. In this work, a composite photoanode consisting of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles embedded into ZnO nanowire arrays is fabricated for photoelectrochemical solar water splitting. The composite photoanode takes advantage of both the high photocatalytic activity of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles and the fast electron transport enabled by single crystalline ZnO nanowires. Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles are able to <b>harness</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> and possess higher photoactivity than most known semiconductors including BiVO 4 and WO 3 under <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> irradiation, thanks to the band structure of Ag 3 PO 4 and the high internal surface area of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles. However, the efficiency of the photoanode made of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticle films is limited by the slow electron transport between the disorderly packed Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles and only very thin films of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles may be used. We have found that embedding the Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles into ordered ZnO nanowire arrays may allow much thicker films of Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles to be used and the photocurrent may be improved by up to six times compared to planar Ag 3 PO 4 /ZnO films, primarily due to the improved charge transportation enabled by the vertically ordered single crystalline ZnO nanowire arrays. Our result indicates that Ag 3 PO 4 nanoparticles-embedded ZnO nanowire array is a promising composite photoanode for solar water splitting...|$|R

The photoelectrocatalytic activities of the resultant photoanode under UV (main wavelength of 365 nm) and <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> (l > 400 nm) irradiation were evaluated using water as the probe compound. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the UV light illuminated photoanode was found to be 0. 144 mA mW 1, significantly higher than that obtained from the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> illuminated photoanode (0. 102 mA mW 1). Despite this, the determined value of 0. 102 mA mW 1 represents an excellent <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> photoelectrocatalytic activity of the photoanode. The origin of <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> activity could be attributed to the doped Ti 3 + in the bulk TiO 2.
