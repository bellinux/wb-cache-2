It will comprise a large round lake, with a strip-shaped promontory that will allow pedestrians to walk to the center of the lake itself. A helix shaped hill (called [...] "The Spiral of Time") will provide a panoramic view of the city; an artistic representation of the <b>double</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>helix</b> will be placed on top of the hill. Both the lake and the hill will be part of a park section called [...] "Time Garden", partitioned into three areas dedicated to prehistory, history and present times.|$|E
40|$|Each {{organism}} stores its {{genetic information}} in large DNA molecules, present in most cells. DNA {{is composed of}} four different nucleotides, abbreviated as G,A,T,and C, which make up the genetic code that is translated into proteins. An intermediate between DNA and protein is the RNA, that is generated by a process called transcription, during which one strand of the <b>double</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>helix</b> serves as a template and is read by a scanning RNA polymerase complex. As a result, a messenger RNA molecule is produced, that in turn forms a template for protein synthesis. It is of major importance that changes (mutations) in the genetic code of the DNA are limited to a minimum. Although mutations {{form the basis of}} biological diversity, they can also be the starting point of carcinogenesis in multicellular species. The genomic DNA is continuously challenged by a variety of damaging agents, interfering with cellular processes that involve DNA metabolism. Of many of those reagents, the nature of the resulting lesion has been established. Various chemical compounds, inducing bulky adducts, and also UV-irradiation cause distortions and bending of the DNA helix. Ionising irradiation and oxygen radicals afe known to generate single and double strand breaks in the DNA, while exposure to alkylating agents can lead to various types of modification of single nucleotides. Also, intracellular processes can enhance the intrinsic instability of some of the DNA bonds and can lead to alterations in the DNA, e. g. via hydrolysis and oxidation. Mutations are generated if these modified nucleotides mispair during DNA replication (prior to cell division). which can also happen spontaneously. This will in many cases lead to incorporation of a wrong nucleotide, thus generating a 'mismatch' which, when wrongly processed, can lead to a change of the genetic code. All organisms have developed an intricate network of DNA repair modes to remove the lesions before they can exert their deleterious effects...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe " 7 kDa DNA-binding " family, {{also known}} as the Sul 7 d family, is {{composed}} of chromatin proteins from the Sulfolobales archaeal order. Among them, Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d have been the focus of several studies with some characterization of their properties. Here, we studied eleven other proteins alongside Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d under the same conditions. The dissociation constants of the purified proteins for binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were determined in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C and were in the range from 11 μM to 22 μM with a preference for G/C rich sequences. In accordance with the extremophilic origin of their hosts, the proteins were found highly stable from pH 0 to pH 12 and at temperatures from 85. 5 °C to 100 °C. Thus, these results validate eight putative " 7 kDa DNA-binding " family proteins and show that they behave similarly regarding both their function and their stability among various genera and species. As Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d have found numerous uses as molecular biology reagents and artificial affinity proteins, this study also sheds light on even more attractive proteins that will facilitate engineering of novel highly robust reagents. In living organisms, the long genomic DNA has to be packed in order to fit into cells, while the genetic information must stay accessible for replication and transcription events. To this aim, organisms have developed different compaction systems, such as the wrapping of DNA around histones to form the chromatin in Eukarya, and the supercoiling of DNA with the help of non-histone proteins to form the nucleoid in Bacteria. Archaea often live in extreme environments and have the additional challenge to protect their genomic DNA from extreme conditions, such as high temperatures. Many Archaea contain homologs of eukaryotic histones, but Desulfurococcales, Thermoplasmatales and Sulfolobales use a different kind of packaging proteins 1, 2. Hyperthermophile and acidophile archaea of the Sulfolobales order from the Crenarchaeota kingdom express small basic DNA-binding proteins, which represent about 5 % of the total soluble cellular proteins, sufficient to coat the entire genome of a Sulfolobus cell 3. These proteins constitute the family called " 7 kDa DNA-binding " or Sul 7 d 4. They were first isolated from Sulfolobus acido-caldarius which produces five of them, named Sac 7 a, b, c, d, and e. Sac 7 d and Sac 7 e are encoded by distinct genes, while Sac 7 a and b are truncated versions of Sac 7 d 5 – 7. Highly similar homologs have been found in all Sulfolobus species, such as Sso 7 d from Sulfolobus solfataricus 8, and Ssh 7 a and Ssh 7 b from Sulfolobus shibatae-two proteins encoded by two distinct genes 3, 9. Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d are the two most studied proteins of this family. They have been characterized for their structure, function, chemical stability and biophysical properties 7. Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d are hyperthermostable (T m = 90. 4 °C and 100. 2 °C, respectively) 10, 11 and are resistant from pH 0 up to at least pH 12 12, 13. Although Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d sequences show only few differences, Sso 7 d is more stable than Sac 7 d. Their three-dimensional structures show that they both fold as an SH 3 -like domain capped by a C-terminal α-helix 14, 15 and that they sharply kink the <b>double</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>helix</b> upon binding into the minor groove 16, 17. It has been shown that Sac 7 d and Sso 7 d are general dsDNA binders with K D values varying in a salt dependent manner from 20 nM (low salt) to 3. 8 μ M (high salt) for Sac 7 d, and from 116 nM to 12. 8 μ M for Sso 7 d, and with a preference for G/C rich sequences 18, 19. Sac 7 d has the property to increase the thermal stability of DNA duplexes by as much as 43. 5 °C 6, 15. Furthermore, Ssh 7 a and Ssh 7 b have been partially characterized and an affinity for dsDNA of about 100 n...|$|E

40|$|Sequence-directed {{variations}} in the canonical <b>DNA</b> <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> structure that retain Watson-Crick base-pairing play important roles in DNA recognition, topology, and nucleosome positioning. By using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy in concert with steered molecular dynamics simulations, we have observed transient sequence-specific excursions away from Watson-Crick base-pairing at CA and TA steps inside canonical duplex DNA towards low-populated and short-lived A•T and G•C Hoogsteen base-pairs. The observation of Hoogsteen base-pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the <b>DNA</b> <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base-pairs {{as a means of}} expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing.

50|$|A {{base pair}} (bp) is a unit {{consisting}} of two nucleobases bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. They form {{the building blocks of}} the <b>DNA</b> <b>double</b> <b>helix,</b> and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA.

The complementary nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the <b>DNA</b> <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> make <b>DNA</b> well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA, and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA.
