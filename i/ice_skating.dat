25|$|The sticks that Fitzstephen {{refers to}} {{were used for}} movement, as the {{primitive}} bone-made <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> did not have sharp gliding edges like modern <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b> Adding edges to <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> was invented by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. These <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> has remained largely the same. The only other major change in <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> design came soon after. Around {{the same time period}} as steel edges were added to <b>ice</b> <b>skates,</b> another Dutchman, a table maker’s apprentice, experimented with the height to width ratio of the metal blade of the <b>ice</b> <b>skates,</b> producing a design that remains almost unaltered to this day. The user of the skates no longer needed to use sticks for propulsion, and movement on skates was now freer and more stable.|$|R

5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to <b>ice</b> <b>skating.</b> Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
