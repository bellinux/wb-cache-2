A reed extracted from a common bagpipe was implemented as the glottis, the source of the raw <b>fundamental</b> <b>sound</b> in the vocal tract. The bell of a clarinet made for a sufficient mouth, despite its rigid form. This basic model was able to produce simple vowel sounds only, though some additional articulation was possible by positioning one’s hand at the bell opening to obstruct airflow. The physical hardware for constructing the nasals, plosives and fricatives that most consonants require was not present, however. Kempelen, like many other early pioneers of phonetics, misunderstood the source of the perceived “higher frequencies” of certain sounds {{as a function of the}} glottis, rather than as the function of the formants of the entire vocal tract, so he abandoned his single-reed design for a multiple-reed approach.23 ...|$|E

Most notably, the rap rock genre became popular in the late 1990s, with bands like Rage Against the Machine, KoRn, Sublime, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park. Aesthetically, they changed the way rappers presented themselves. Onstage, old school rappers had previously performed in flashy attire and colorful costumes, typically had a live band and, {{in the case of}} acts like Whodini, had background dancers. Run-D.M.C. performed with only Run and DMC out front, and Jam-Master Jay on the turntables behind them, in what is now considered the 'classic' hip hop stage setup: two turntables and microphones. They embraced the look and style of the street by wearing jeans, lace-less Adidas sneakers, and their trademark black fedoras. The group shunned both the over-the-top wardrobe of previous rap stars like the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa, and the silk-shirted, jheri curled, ladies' man look of rappers like Kurtis Blow and Spoonie Gee. Followers of their style included LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys; seemingly overnight, rappers were wearing jeans and sneakers instead of rhinestones and leather outfits. From Adidas tracksuits and rope chains to baggy jeans and Timberland footwear, hip hop's look remained married to the styles of the street.

[...] Also in 1965 they brought in Sonny Gerachi, later in Climax, to handle the lead vocals.

A transposition scale is introduced to provide a set of intervals commensurate with the musical scale, such as chromatic or just intonation scales. A sequence of intervals selected from the transposition scale is used to shift instrument frequency at predefined times during the composition {{which serves as a}} harmonic sequence of a composition. A transposition sequence constructed in such a way can be extended to a hierarchy of sequences. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>sound</b> frequency of an instrument is obtained as a product of the base frequency, instrument key factor, and a cumulative product of respective factors from all the harmonic sequences. The multiplication factors are selected from subsets of rational numbers, which form instrument scales and transposition scales of different levels. Each harmonic sequence can be related to its own transposition scale, or a single scale can be used for all levels. When composing for an orchestra of instruments, harmonic sequences and instrument scales can be assigned independently to each musical instrument. The method solves the problem of using just intonation scale across multiple octaves as well as simplifies writing of instrument scores. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, 3 music sample...|$|E

The developed system features two key uses. First, the system can be integrated into an active bridge management system that tracks usage and structural changes. Second, the system helps bridge owners to identify overload occurrence, vehicle collision to the structure, damage and deterioration.;The primary objective of this research was to develop a SHM system that could be used to monitor typical girder bridges for detecting and identifying overload occurrence, vehicle collision to the structure, changes in structural behavior, identification of damage and deterioration, and for tracking usage. These specific needs were established to give owners the tools to better manage bridge assets and were accomplished by completing three distinct work tasks.;The first task involved developing bridge-specific live load structural analysis software, BEC Analysis. Like many analysis software packages, the fundamental algorithm was based upon classic beam theory and the direct stiffness method structural analysis. BEC Analysis can be used for (1) analyzing beams or girders under moving loads, (2) computing absolute maximums in each span or at a specific location, and (3) generating envelopes of maximum moments and strains.;The second task involved developing the field data collection and analysis software that integrates with select data acquisition hardware. The software was designed to automatically collect, process, and evaluate the measured response of a bridge. Its use may allow bridge owners to quantitatively monitor a bridge for potential damage as well as gradual change in behavior. Significant effort was given to developing algorithms that include temperature compensation and <b>fundamental</b> <b>sound</b> data reduction and data mining techniques.;After {{the development of}} the SHM system was completed, the system was tested and implemented on a highway bridge to demonstrate and verify its general usage.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of {{quantitative and qualitative}} landscape characteristics is necessary to successfully articulate intervention or change in the landscape. In landscape planning and design 3 D visualizations {{have been used to}} successfully communicate various aspects of landscape to a diverse population, though they have been shown to lag behind real-world experience in perceptual experiments. There is evidence that engaging other senses can alter the perception of 3 D visualizations, which this thesis used as a departure point for the research project. Three research questions guide the investigation. The first research question is: How do fundamental elements in visualizations (i. e. terrain, vegetation and built form) interact with <b>fundamental</b> <b>sound</b> types (i. e. anthropogenic, mechanical and natural) to affect perceived realism of, and preference for, 3 D landscape visualization? The research used empirical methods of a controlled experiment and statistical analysis of quantitative survey responses to examine the perceptual responses to the interaction aural and visual stimuli in St. James’s Park, London, UK. The visualizations were sourced from Google Earth, and the sounds recorded in situ, with Google Earth chosen as it is being used more frequently in landscape planning and design processes, though has received very little perceptual research focus. The second research question is: Do different user characteristics interact with combined aural-visual stimuli to alter perceived realism and preferences for 3 D visualization? The final research question emerged out of the experiment design concentrating on research methodology: How effective is the Internet for aural-visual data collection compared to the laboratory setting? The results of the quantitative analysis can be summarized as follows: For research question 1 the results show that sound alters 3 D visualization perception both positively and negatively, which varies by landscape element. For all visual conditions mechanical sound significantly lowers preference. For visualizations showing terrain only perceived realism and preference are significantly lowered by anthropogenic sound and significantly raised by natural sound for both realism and preference. For visualizations showing a combination of terrain with built form anthropogenic and mechanical sound significantly raises perceived realism. For visualizations showing a combination of terrain, vegetation and some built form a more complicated interaction occurs for realism, which is moderated by the amount of built form in the scene, e. g. with no buildings in the scene traffic and speech significantly lower realism ratings in similar ways while a small amount of built form visible resulted in speech significantly raising realism ratings. Preference was significantly lowered by anthropogenic and mechanical sound the most out of all three visual conditions. For research question 2 the results confirm that perception can vary for realism by gender and first language differences, and preference by age, first language, cultural and professional background and 3 D familiarity. Finally for research question 3 and implications for Internet-based multisensory experiments there is strong evidence that audio hardware and experimental condition (laboratory vs. online) do not significantly alter realism and preference ratings, though larger display sizes can have a significant but very small effect on preference ratings (+/- 0. 08 on a 5 -point scale). The results indicate that sound significantly alters the perception of realism and preference for landscape simulated via 3 D visualizations, with the congruence of aural and visual stimuli having a strong impact on both perceptual responses. The results provide important empirical evidence for future research to build upon, and raise important questions relating to authenticity of landscape experience, particularly when relying solely on visual material as visuals alone do not accurately simulate landscape experience. In addition the research confirms the cross-sensory nature of perception in virtual environments. As a result the inclusion of sound for landscape visualization and aesthetic research is concluded to be of critical importance. The research results suggest that when using sound with 3 D visualizations the sound content match the visualized material, and to avoid using sounds that contain human speech unless there is a very strong reason to do so (e. g. there are humans in the visualization). The final chapter discusses opportunities for integrating sound with 3 D visualizations in order to increase the perception of realism and preference in landscape planning and design processes, and concludes with areas for future research. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with mechanisms of sound generation by unsteady hydrodynamic motions in shear flows. Such problems are of great importance for the aviation industry, where noise reduction {{has long been a}} serious concern. The current state of the art in this field primarily rests on the acoustic analogy theory initiated by Lighthill (1952) and its numerous variants. An alternative method, based on matched asymptotic expansions, was developed by Crow (1970) among others. It was recently further advanced further within the framework of triple-deck theory to predict sound emission from certain viscous flows {{in the presence of a}} boundary (Wu 2002). We apply this approach to three aeroacoustic problems, which are deemed suitable for a triple-deck approach, with a view to analyze some <b>fundamental</b> <b>sound</b> generation processes on a self-consistent first-principle basis. The first problem addresses sound generation in a transonic boundary layer subjected to unsteady suction and injection. The analogous problem was analysed by Wu (2002) for subsonic flows but the theory breaks down at transonic speeds. The transonic effect first manifests itself when 1 −M 2 = O(R− 1 / 9), where M is the free-stream Mach number and R the global Reynolds number, which is assumed large. The unsteady flow due to the suction/injection is accommodated by a somewhat different triple-deck structure, in which the unsteady effect appears at the leading order in the upper deck, as was found by Bowles & Smith (1993). It is found that the resulting sound field is fundamentally different from its subsonic counterpart. The subsonic flow field involves an outer region, in which the pressure assumes an acoustic character. Such an outer region is not present in the transonic case, and it is not possible to express the solution in terms of multipoles since the source is not compact. Most importantly, it is found that the radiated sound produces a leading-order ‘back action’ effect on the source. The second problem {{is concerned with}} the acoustic radiation emitted by instability waves as they undergo rapid distortion, which has been recognized as one of prime mechanisms by which instability waves generate sound. We consider the situation where the rapid distortion in the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves is caused by a localized surface roughness in a compressible subsonic boundary layer. We find that in order to predict the leading-order acoustic pressure fluctuation, the first four terms in the expansion for the hydrodynamic field have to be determined. They contribute equally to the radiated sound because they act as octupole, quadrupole, dipole and monopole sources respectively. The analysis reveals two types of cancellations, which may explain the difficulties in accurately predicting aerodynamic sound. The first occurs in spectral space in the small-wavenumber limit; this cancellation renders the leading-order source to act as an octupole rather than a quadrupole source. The second type occurs in physical space, among the sources in different regions of the flow. The analysis also shows that a localized roughness influences the energetics of a T-S wave and this effect can be characterized by a transmission coefficient. The third problem that we analyze is that of sound emission due to a stationary source embedded in a boundary layer. Our aim is to obtain some generic results, which generalise the studies of individual cases to encompass a broad class of flows. For that purpose, we seek Green’s functions corresponding to an arbitrarily specified source located in the main deck. The temporal and spatial scales of the source are assumed to be compatible with those of triple-deck theory so that the near-field hydrodynamics can be described by a triple-deck structure and a fourth, outer region accommodates the acoustic pressure. The solution is sought in terms of an asymptotic series for the pressure. The required order of approximation depends on the radiating nature of the effective source q, which can be characterized by its behaviour in the small wavenumber k limit. If q = O(1) for k = 0, the first two terms are needed. They act as dipole and monopole sources respectively and so contribute equally to the sound in an asymptotic sense. If q = O(k) for k 1, the first three terms have to be obtained, which act as quadrupole, dipole and monopole sources respectively. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
