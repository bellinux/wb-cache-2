5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in {{the hearts and minds of}} people and not through legislation.

Vratislav Doubek, Ph. D. Abstract: The {{central theme of}} the presented bachelor thesis {{is one of the}} control mechanisms of national parliaments - the {{institute of}} <b>interpellations.</b> The actual and controversial condition of this institute reflected by experts and lay public was the impulse for devising the study for the proposer. The presented text is the analysis of the institute of <b>interpellations</b> since 1996 till the last parliamentary election in 2010. There has been lower interest in using <b>interpellations</b> by deputies and loss of their usefulness which is evident since 1996. The task of the analysis is to prove and clarify this fact, as well as discover distinct tendencies and changes in practise of <b>interpellations</b> for this period. The author will make a comparison through party political spectrum and expressing the transformation in interactions between government and the parliament, more precisely the deputies of particular political parties. The research will be executed by method of quantitative and qualitative analysis and comparison. The author will use primary sources as well as secondary literature.

25|$|The 1993 Swiss {{documentary}} Helden vom Himmel first {{mentioned that}} dark chapter of Swiss history.

Thus far, the fates of the internees in Wauwilermoos were widely unknown to the public. In publications on Swiss history, the internment in Wauwilermoos has hardly been explored in depth. In reports, Wauwilermoos is very rarely mentioned, and the Swiss politics has hardly taken care, except to the 1944 <b>interpellation</b> from M.

40|$|During the 1990 s, Menem led a {{profound}} transformation in public policies in Argentina, implementing {{a model of}} accumulation positioned {{at the opposite end}} of the post-war Welfare State. However, he managed to maintain the support of a majority of the traditional National-Popular and Peronist sectors, and reformulate, with a relative degree of success, the long-established identities. This paper analyzes the <b>interpellations</b> and arguments that the president constructed to legitimize the transformation of identity in the direction of neoliberal-conservative ideas. From a post-foundational perspective, the article argues against essentialist analyses and, at the same time, raises the question of performativity in post-foundational thought. It proposes an analytical differentiation between the planes and levels of discourse, for the purpose of examining the performative efficacy of any hegemonic formation. It concludes that the analysis of presidential <b>interpellations,</b> in conjunction with non-linguistic discourse conditionings, provides key resources for understanding said efficacy and consolidation of the neoliberal order...|$|R

2500|$|Failure to {{supervise}} the financial sector, at that point dominated by weak banks and outright financial pyramids that wiped out the savings of {{a substantial part of}} the population, was cited by the opposition as {{one of the reasons for}} its proposal to express no-confidence in the Government in June 1994, the first such proposal in post-independence Lithuania. Nevertheless, the government survived this and another <b>interpellation</b> on 31 October 1995. The situation changed after the collapse of two commercial banks in December 1995. It emerged that Prime Minister Šleževičius had withdrawn his savings from one of the two banks just days before its collapse. After refusing to resign, he was forced out by the Seimas in a secret-ballot vote on 19 December 1995, with 94 members supporting his ousting.

6000|$|Mr. Blanchard Jerrold, in his 'Life of Cruikshank,' {{tells us}} that the artist sang this 'old English ballad' at a dinner where Dickens and Thackeray were present. Mr. Thackeray remarked: 'I should like to print that ballad with illustrations,' but Cruikshank 'warned him off,' as he {{intended}} to do the thing himself. Dickens furnished the learned notes. This account of what occurred was given by Mr. Walter Hamilton, but Mr. Sala furnished another version. The 'authorship of the ballad,' Mr. Sala justly observed, 'is involved in mystery.' Cruikshank picked it up from the recitation of a minstrel outside a pot-house. In Mr. Sala's opinion, Mr. Thackeray 'revised and settled the words, and made them fit for publication.' Nor did he confine himself to the mere critical work; he added, in Mr. Sala's opinion, that admired passage about 'The young bride's mother, who never before was heard to speak so free,' also contributing 'The Proud Young Porter,' Jeames. Now, in fact, both the <b>interpellation</b> of the bride's mamma, and the person and characteristics of the proud young porter, are of unknown antiquity, and are not due to Mr. Thackeray--a scholar too conscientious to 'decorate ' an ancient text. Bishop Percy did such things, and Scott is not beyond suspicion; but Mr. Thackeray, like Joseph Ritson, preferred the authentic voice of tradition. Thus, in the text of the Biographical Edition, he does not imitate the Cockney twang, phonetically rendered in the version of Cruikshank. The second verse, for example, runs thus: ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the pursuit}} of these sciences, our success in each, depends on an austere and {{faithful}} adherence to its own principles, with a careful separation and exclusion of those, which appertain to the opposite science. As the natural philosopher, who directs his views to the objective, avoids above all things the intermixture of the subjective in his knowledge, as for instance, arbitrary suppositions or rather suflictions, occult qualities, spiritual agents, and the substitution of final for efficient causes; so on the other hand, the transcendental or intelligential philosopher is equally anxious to preclude all <b>interpellation</b> of the objective into the subjective principles of his science, as for instance the assumption of impresses or configurations in the brain, correspondent to miniature pictures on the retina painted by rays of light from supposed originals, which are not the immediate and real objects of vision, but deductions from it {{for the purposes of}} explanation. This purification of the mind is effected by an absolute and scientific scepticism, to which the mind voluntarily determines itself for the specific purpose of future certainty. Des Cartes who (in his meditations) himself first, at least of the moderns, gave a beautiful example of this voluntary doubt, this self-determined indetermination, happily expresses its utter difference from the scepticism of vanity or irreligion: Nec tamen in Scepticos imitabar, qui dubitant tantum ut dubitent, et praeter incertitudinem ipsam nihil quaerunt. Nam contra totus in eo eram ut aliquid certi reperirem [51]. Nor is it less distinct in its motives and final aim, than in its proper objects, which are not as in ordinary scepticism the prejudices of education and circumstance, but those original and innate prejudices which nature herself has planted in all men, and which to all but the philosopher are the first principles of knowledge, and the final test of truth.|$|E

It is rather the deportation gap than the deportation turn which inspires control interest {{on the part of}} the political parties. Our analysis also shows that the <b>interpellations</b> closely reflect the (anti‐) migration agenda of the inquiring parties which leads to a polarization between government and opposition as well as within the opposition. Prevailing control deficits when  it  comes  to  removal‐specific  issues  beyond  nation‐state  borders,  the  insufficient  transparency within the policy area, "voluntary" returns and deportations of non­‐refugee target groups are partly due to these dynamics...|$|R
