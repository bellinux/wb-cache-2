5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Tavares earned another invite to the {{selection}} camp for the 2008 World Junior Championships and made the final roster for the tournament on his second attempt. He scored four goals to help Canada to its fourth-straight {{gold medal in the}} competition. Returning the next year, along with Zach Boychuk, P. K. Subban and Thomas Hickey from the previous year's gold medal-winning team, Tavares was selected to compete in the 2009 World Junior Championships in Ottawa, Ontario. He scored three points in the first round-robin game against the Czech Republic, an 8–1 win, and was named Player of the Game. In the final round-robin game against the United States, Tavares scored a hat-trick for his 12th career goal of the tournament to tie Eric Lindros and Jeff Carter for the all-time Canadian junior record. In doing so, Taveres helped propel Canada to a 7–4 win that gave them the top spot in their pool and a subsequent bye to the tournament semifinal. He was also named Player of the Game {{for the second time in}} the tournament for his performance on the night. Meeting Russia in the semifinal and down 5–4 with less than ten seconds left in regulation, Tavares fought off two Russian players along the boards and backhanded a shot towards the goal. The shot was blocked by defenceman Dmitri Kulikov a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the net, but after the puck came loose, teammate Jordan Eberle retrieved it and sent it into the right side of the net to dramatically tie the game with 5.4 seconds left. Then, as the game was forced into a shootout, Tavares scored to put Canada up 2–0 in the tie-breaker and into the gold medal game against Sweden. Recording an assist in the final, he helped Canada defeat the Swedes 5–1 to capture their fifth-straight gold medal. Tavares finished the tournament with eight goals and seven assists for 15 points in six games, second only to teammate Cody Hodgson in tournament scoring. Tavares was also named one of the top three players on the Canadian team by its coaching staff, as well as a tournament All-Star, Top Forward and MVP.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{opened their}} MVC {{schedule}} on a Saturday night in Chicago at #17 Loyola {{in a battle}} of the top two defenses in the conference.

25|$|As {{illustrated}} above, {{the pitch}} is marked {{at each end}} with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet {{either side of the}} wicket), it is in fact unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also in fact unlimited in length.|$|E
25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1914–15 season, the Senators and Wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses. A two-game, total goal series was played to determine the NHA league champion who would contest the Stanley Cup with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association winner, the Vancouver Millionaires. Ross, who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season, scored one goal in the first match against the Wanderers, a Senators 4–0 victory, and though Ottawa lost the second game 1–0, they won the series, 4–1. To help the Senators stop the Wanderers, who were known for their speed, Ross created a new system of defence. Termed [...] "kitty bar the door", it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice 30 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the goaltender to stop offensive rushes. This style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the neutral zone trap, later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances.|$|E

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E

But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me.

500|$|On 17 October, all men aged 18 to 60 {{were ordered}} to report for a meeting, but were {{detained}} overnight instead on the pretext that someone had fired shots in the village the previous night. The detainees were beaten, and otherwise abused that night. Approximately 20 were released in the morning, and the rest {{were told that they}} were assigned to grape harvest duty. The civilians walked out of the village under a military escort. One of the civilians was killed by the guards, before the group reached a point within [...] of the Vukovar–Tovarnik road, where they were ordered into a cloverfield at gunpoint. The men were told to hold hands and sweep their <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them across the ground. The JNA had previously placed land mines in the field. Several mines were set off, while the troops guarding the civilian detainees fired at the men in the field. The survivors were then forced to retrieve the dead and injured and clear the remaining mines. Out of 50 civilians forced into the minefield, 21 were killed in the minefield itself. The number of persons wounded by mine explosions or gunfire is variously reported as 14 or 15. Three more civilians were killed in Lovas by the end of November.|$|E

[...] With a 40% open area, the screen wall sits three <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> an expansive glazed curtain wall and provides shading of the upper level reading room while allowing natural daylight to enter the space. [...] The shading system allows a reduced dependence on artificial lighting and protects the Library’s collection from harmful solar exposure. To {{take full advantage of}} the location's potential for unobstructed natural light, clerestory windows and translucent, insulated fiberglass panels on the north provide illumination from the sun on all sides. Lighting design firm MCLA validated light levels in the large, open room through a detailed analysis. The lighting designers developed an electric lighting system based primarily on the T5 linear fluorescent with a 3500-Kelvin color temperature—the lamp preferred by the client for energy and maintenance efficiency. Special fixtures are cantilevered from the tall stacks for vertical illumination on the books, and suspended luminaires are mounted over reading tables and workstations.|$|E
