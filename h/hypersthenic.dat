Anthropometric assessment included determination of 16 measurement characteristics, the results of which are major components of the calculation {{carried out by the}} method of contingent Chernorutskiy. According to the Pignet index of the physical development the boys were divided into three somatotypes: asthenic, <b>hypersthenic,</b> and normostenic. Morphological and functional characteristics of organism characterized by continuous and discrete individual variability, which corresponded to separate individual-typological groups with predominance of normostenic (61 %) and <b>hypersthenic</b> (12. 2 %) somatotype. The dependence of the levels of free and total thyroxin in the blood of young men on their individually-typological features were discovered. The young men of asthenic somatotype have the highest level of total and free thyroxin in the blood; boys of <b>hypersthenic</b> somatotype were characterized by the low levels of these hormones...|$|E

40|$|Age {{effect on}} gas {{exchange}} was {{studied in the}} recumbent and orthostatic positions and under physical load. In {{the case of the}} older age group and for normal as compared with <b>hypersthenic</b> persons, oxygen consumption during rest and during moderate physical overload diminishes. When the vertical position is assumed oxygen consumption in persons of various age groups is distinctly increased, particularly in the elderly group. There is a reduction in the amount of oxygen consumption, oxygen pulse, recovery coefficient, and work efficiency under moderate overload. In persons over 50, physical labor induces a large oxygen requirement and a sharp rise in the level of lactic acid and the blood's lactate/pyruvate ratio. No distinct difference was noted in the amount of oxygen consumed during rest and during physical overload in {{men and women of the}} same physical development and age...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} is to explore {{interrelation}} and contingency between somatometric characteristics and heart rate variability in male students having resided in Magadan region area. Materials and Methods: Pursuing from the study aim we examined basic somatometric, cardiovascular and heart rate variability parameters in 558 young males of different somatotypes: asthenia, normosthenia and hypersthenia. Results: Main results testify that the values of the heart rate were within the range of normotonia through the three examined groups (with small prevailing of parasympathetic link in the heart rate regulation). The <b>hypersthenic</b> subjects demonstrated a sounder parasympathetic link in their heart rate regulation, while asthenic subjects – sympathetic one. The asthenic subjects demonstrated reliably higher heart beats values being thus considered as having less efficient cardiovascular system functioning. The analysis of the percent ratio of the examined subjects accounting for initial autonomic tone in each body constitution group has shown that no difference had been found between the percentage in each somatotype group and the percentage in the whole sample. Discussion and Conclusions: The autonomic regulation types do not directly depend on somatometric characteristics and, particularly, on any type of the body constitution...|$|E
40|$|In the Myoko volcanoes', {{pyroxene}} andesite and hornblende andesite {{are very}} common, and basalt which {{belongs to the}} high-alumina basalt by KuNo (1960) is also accompanied in subordinate amount. Generally, the rocks tend to change from lower to upper in each group as follows: basalt. pyroxene andesite. hornblende andesite. The rocks of these volcanoes may be distinguished form the Quaternary volcanic rocks just east of MYOKO in common oocurrence of hornblende phenocrysts, and {{from those of the}} South-west Japan in absense of biotite phenocrysts. The features of the chemical composition such as high K 20 and A 1203 contents and low CaO content, and of the mineral assemblage such as common oocurrence of hornblende phenocrysts, have well resemblance to those of the Chokai volcanic belt, and they form a striking contrast to those found along the Pachic Ocean side. The K 20 content of the rocks of MYOKO tends to increase northward, This tendency is keeping with the inerease of K 20 Åëontent from the Pacific Ocean side to the Japaii Sea side. The xenoliths, and inclusions assumed to be xenoliths, are cornmonly found in the rocks of MYOKO. lhey are very common in the <b>hypersthenic</b> series rocks, but are rather rare in pigeonitic series rocks. They have generally reacted with magma, and perfectly or partly changed thei...|$|E

MALADAPTIVE REACTIONS OF INTERNSHIP DOCTORS DURING THE PERIOD OF ADAPTATION TO PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES Valeriy V. Vyun, Anna M. Kozhina Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine e-mail: psychotip@gmail. com Abstract During the work on the basis of a systematic approach to the study of mechanisms of psychological adaptation of the internship doctors to the profession has developed a system of medical and psychological support during the specialist professional training. It was found that in the period of adaptation to professional activity by internship doctors marked asthenic, <b>hypersthenic,</b> apathetic, depressed, addictive and psychosomatic options of maladaptive reactions. Developed and tested system of medical and psychological support to the doctor in the period of adaptation to professional activity, which includes: a program of psychological and psychosocial training, system of psychological counseling for internship doctors. The results of the 3 -year follow-up monitoring indicate a high efficiency of the proposed system of medical and psychological support to the doctor in the period of adaptation to the professional activity.

Programming fitness-program for senior pupils to do physical exercises independently Ludmyla Vashchuk Lesya Ukrainka Eastern European National University (Lutsk, Ukraine) Fitness-program is characterized by the set of the specially selected physical exercises aimed at the complex or selective impact on the body or some parts of the body depending on the morpho-functional human capacity. Introduced general structure of the fitness-program may be corrected depending on the targets of the training, physical state and senior pupils’ motivation. Some fitness-programs containing muscle-strengthening exercises were introduced to solve the problems of the correction of the body. The muscle-strengthening exercises for increasing the body weight, circumference of the parts of the body (shoulders, chest, pelvis, thighs), improving the rates of muscle tonus were recommended for the girls having asthenic body build. The senior pupils having <b>hypersthenic</b> body build did exercises to decrease the body weight and circumference of the parts of the body (shoulders, breast, pelvis, thighs), fatty component. The physical exercises for a normosthenic body build were aimed at amelioration of muscle tonus, decreasing the rate of the increase of body weight and circumference of pelvis.
