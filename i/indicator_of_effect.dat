40|$|The {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> {{the indirect}} <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fishing {{is often an}} issue for fisheries management, particularly if just commercial catch data are available. Complex, intermediate, and simplified qualitative models were produced for a fishery case study off Western Australia to identify potential <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem change attributable to western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus) extraction and bait input. Models of intermediate complexity were used to identify indicators because they produced the least aggregation error. Structural uncertainty was considered {{through a series of}} structurally different intermediate models. These alternate models consistently predicted that extraction of rock lobster may positively impact small fish of low economic value, such as old wife (Enoplosus armatus), footballer sweep (Neatypus obliquus), and king wrasse (Coris auricularis). These small fish were therefore identified as potential <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> rock lobster extraction. Small crustaceans (amphipods and isopods) also displayed positive impacts attributable to bait input from the rock lobster fishery and were identified as potential <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> bait <b>effects.</b> Monitoring <b>of</b> these <b>indicators</b> may aid the detection of ecosystem change caused by the rock lobster fishery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Listeners may {{encounter}} speakers {{with a foreign}} accent {{in a variety of}} situations. This task of recognizing words is challenging compared to understanding native speech, but is far from an impossible task. Adaptation to an accent has been shown to occur quickly. Previous research on this adaptation has primarily been conducted via standard behavioral methods. This study employs the recent method of mouse-tracking, allowing examination of trajectories of a listener's hand movements during a listening task, including analysis within a particular trial and the distribution of trajectory shapes. Mouse-tracking is similar to eye-tracking, though it has the benefit of trial-by-trial analysis and a continuous movement described by the dependent variable. Dynamics of hand movement can be seen as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> decision making in lexical processing. In this study, subjects heard an unfamiliar accent of their native language: a form of Hebrew-accented Dutch in which long /i:/ was shortened to /I/.

40|$|There {{is great}} need to {{identify}} simple yet reliable <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>effects</b> within the multi-species, multi-gear, data-poor fisheries of the Caribbean. Here, we investigate links between fishing pressure and three simple fish metrics, i. e. average fish weight (an estimate of average individual fish size), fish density and fish biomass, derived from (1) the parrotfish family, a ubiquitous herbivore family across the Caribbean, and (2) three fish groups of "commercial" carnivores including snappers and groupers, which are widely-used as <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>effects.</b> We hypothesize that, because most Caribbean reefs are being heavily fished, fish metrics derived from the less vulnerable parrotfish group would exhibit stronger relationships with fishing pressure on today's Caribbean reefs than those derived from the highly vulnerable commercial fish groups. We used data from 348 Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef-surveys across the Caribbean to assess relationships between two independent indices of fishing pressure (one derived from human population density data, the other from open to fishing versus protected status) and the three fish metrics derived from the four aforementioned fish groups. We found that, although two fish metrics, average parrotfish weight and combined biomass of selected commercial species, were consistently negatively linked to the indices of fishing pressure across the Caribbean, the parrotfish metric consistently outranked the latter in {{the strength of the}} relationship, thus supporting our hypothesis. Overall, our study highlights that (assemblage-level) average parrotfish size might be a useful alternative <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>effects</b> over the typical conditions of most Caribbean shallow reefs: moderate-to-heavy levels of fishing and low abundance of highly valued commercial species...|$|R

40|$|Pollution-induced {{community}} tolerance (PICT) {{has been}} proposed as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> the deleterious <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> pollutants on communities in the field. Nematode assemblages were sampled at 10 estuarine sites that ranged from uncontaminated to grossly contaminated with metals. Relative tolerance of these assemblages to Cu was quantified using acute toxicity tests. There were large differences between sites in tolerance to Cu, and copper tolerance was strongly correlated with severity of contamination. Enhanced Cu tolerance occurred at two sites where Cu concentration in sediment was around 180 µg/g but not at a third site, where Cu concentration was 214 µg/g. This implies a threshold <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on these nematode communities at ~ 200 µg/g Cu.

We analyzed and compared the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> water abstraction on two threatened cyprinid fishes of contrasting ecology (the Mediterranean barbel Barbus meridionalis and the Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) in a Mediterranean stream. We compared abundance, size-structure, growth, and condition of both species across perennial and artificially intermittent reaches affected by water abstraction. Both species were less abundant, had scarce large individuals, and displayed slower growth rates (length-at-age) in intermittent reaches, showing clear detrimental <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> water diversion. Mixed-effect models of scale increments showed variation among individuals and among sites, years and age classes for both species. The larger-sized, water-column species (chub) disappeared or was rare in many intermittent reaches. The barbel present in intermittent reaches showed better somatic condition than in sites with permanent flow, perhaps due to reduced competition after rewetting or colonization by better fitted individuals. This benthic, rheophilic species seems more resilient to moderate water abstraction than chub. Many <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> water flow intermittency were only detected on fish life-history traits when accounting for natural, often non-linear, variation, along upstream-downstream gradients.
