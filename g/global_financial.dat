5|$|Research and {{academic}} institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations {{to improve the}} transparency and effectiveness of the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> system. For example, the independent non-partisan World Economic Forum facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the <b>Global</b> <b>Financial</b> System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations. The <b>Global</b> <b>Financial</b> Markets Association facilitates discussion of <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> issues among members of various professional associations around the world. The Group of Thirty (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance.|$|E

5|$|While the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> {{system is}} edging toward greater stability, governments {{must deal with}} differing {{regional}} or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> catastrophes.|$|E

5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> affairs.|$|E

5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis of 2007–2008 caused a {{resurgence}} in Keynesian thought.

Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E

5|$|The <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> {{crisis of}} 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism}} about the free market consensus even from some on the economic right.

Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
