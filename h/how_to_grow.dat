5|$|With the {{invention}} of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll came the first images of viruses. In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was {{that they did not know}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E

25|$|The notion for education-based {{workshops}} and displays developed {{out of a}} philosophical view; {{that the world was}} heading towards difficult times and that people needed to learn how to become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs. If one was unable to access healthy food then the logical solution was to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> one's food.

25|$|The {{plant species}} {{originated}} in cultivation. It has been cultivated in {{southern and eastern}} Asia since prehistory. The first known written record of the plant is found in Qimin Yaoshu, an ancient Chinese agricultural treatise completed in 544. The numerous Arabic and North African names for it, along {{with the lack of}} the ancient Greek and Roman names, indicate it was introduced throughout the Mediterranean area by the Arabs in the early Middle Ages. A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Arabic Spain described <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> aubergines. Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans {{determined}} {{the fate of}} European explorers and settlers depending on whether a tribe was kind or warlike. Friendly tribes taught newcomers <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunting methods for the wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for explorers and settlers through their attacks and resistance to European conquest. Many Native Americans died of new infectious diseases, which caused high fatalities and disrupted their cultures {{in the early years}} of colonization. In the 19th century, they resisted European and American expansion, and there was frequent warfare. After the American Civil War, the United States Army was used to suppress resistance in the Indian Wars.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} information on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> Wollemi Pines from seed {{which has been}} harvested from helicopters from the forest trees.

After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet).

25|$|Dionysus {{travels through}} {{the east and}} is entertained by a shepherd, Brongus, in a country fashion. In thanks for his hospitality, Dionysus gives him some wine and teaches him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> and harvest the vine. Astraeis informs Orontes, {{son-in-law}} of the Indian king Deriades, of {{the defeat of the}} Indian army and the ruse of the waters turned into wine. Orontes is furious and harangues his troops not to fear the effeminate Dionysus and his army of women. The Indians charge in and at first seem to win, but Dionysus screams like nine thousand men and detains them. Orontes and Dionysus engage in single combat: a tap of a vine cluster on Orontes' chest is enough to split his armour. Orontes plunges his sword into his own belly and throws himself into the river nearby, giving it his name (Orontes river). The Bacchic troops massacre the Indians. Astraeis flees.|$|E
500|$|<b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> a Woman {{from the}} Ground {{received}} positive reviews from country and bluegrass music critics. [...] Allmusic called it [...] "fantastic", and JamBase described {{it to be}} [...] "a tasteful string dinner" [...] and stated that [...] "this {{is only the beginning}} of great things to come". However, some critics found particular tracks to pale in comparison {{to the rest of the}} material. The Arizona Republic stated that the album was [...] "amazing", except for [...] "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" [...] because [...] "Thile [...] quite match Jack White's musical hysteria". Music Box also said that tracks like [...] "Stay Away" [...] and [...] "I’m Yours If You Want Me" [...] "completely fell flat". Regardless, the review still stated that [...] "the bulk of <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> a Woman from the Ground is remarkably engaging". Bullz-Eye criticized Thile's vocal quality, saying that [...] "his voice often lacks the strength and/or character to carry the song". On the contrary, the previously mentioned JamBase article complimented Thile's vocal strength, saying [...] "it's the soul in Thile's voice and the heart and intensity of the musicianship that give the album its power." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} {{the two brothers}} during the time Alphonse obtained {{the ability to use}} alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemist appearing in the series. Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter. In a common slapstick gag from the series, Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell's wrench. While commenting that Edward has an ability easily dodge her, Arakawa comments that he gets hit on purpose as a result of his personality. The director of the first anime series, Seiji Mizushima, says that in the development of the story Edward [...] "evolves and devolves"; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up. The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward lost something important.|$|E
500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E
