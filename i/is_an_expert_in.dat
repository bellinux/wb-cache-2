500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>in</b> that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
500|$|Development for The Hideous Sun Demon {{began after}} the 1957 release of The Astounding She-Monster, {{a science fiction}} film {{starring}} Clarke. In his contract for the film, Clarke was promised five percent of She-Monsters profits {{in addition to his}} salary. Although Clarke later admitted that the film was awful, it was a financial success, with Clarke receiving a sizable sum from the film's box office returns. Inspired by that film's financial success, Clarke decided to direct his own low-budget science fiction film. According to Clarke, the story for the film was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which dealt with multiple personalities. Clarke and co-writer/director Tom Boutross (although some sources, including Clarke himself, say his friend Phil Hiner co-wrote the first draft) wrote the first draft of the screenplay, then-titled Saurus or Sauros, names taken from the Latin word meaning [...] "reptile". Other working titles for the film included Strange Pursuit and Terror in the Sun. Boutross, who is also credited as one of the film's co-directors, later edited films like Rat Fink (1965), A Man Called Dagger (1967) and 1974 hit The Legend of Boggy Creek. The first draft of the script was significantly different from what would be shown in the finished film. The original storyline centered on an explorer and a female lawyer searching for uranium in the country of Guatemala. While there, they are tormented by {{a man who had been}} mutated by experiments conducted on him by his scientist father, who <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>in</b> radiation, and when the young man is exposed to the sun, he transforms into a reptilian creature.|$|E
