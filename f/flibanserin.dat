25|$|The FDA has {{approved}} one medication {{for the treatment}} of disorders of female libido, <b>flibanserin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Flibanserin</b> is {{used for}} hypoactive sexual desire {{disorder}} among women. Those receiving <b>flibanserin</b> report a 0.5 increase compared to placebo {{in the number of}} times they had “satisfying sexual events”. In those on <b>flibanserin</b> it rose from 2.8 to 4.5 times a month while women receiving placebo reported also an increase of “satisfying sexual events” from 2.7 to 3.7 times a month. The onset of the <b>flibanserin</b> effect was seen from the first timepoint measured after 4 weeks of treatment and maintained throughout the treatment period.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flibanserin</b> {{acts as a}} {{full agonist}} in the frontal cortex and the raphe dorsalis, but only as a partial agonist in the CA3 region of the {{hippocampus}} [...] of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 1 nM in CHO cells, but only 15-50 nM in cortex, hippocampus and dorsal raphe) and, with lower affinity, as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 49 nM) and antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the D4 receptor (Ki = 4-24 nM). Despite the much greater affinity of <b>flibanserin</b> for the 5-HT1A receptor, and {{for reasons that are}} unknown (although it might be caused by the competition with endogenous serotonin), <b>flibanserin</b> occupies the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in vivo with similar percentages. <b>Flibanserin</b> also has low affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 89.3 nM) and the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 88.3 nM), both of which it behaves as an antagonist of. <b>Flibanserin</b> preferentially activates 5-HT1A receptors in the prefrontal cortex, demonstrating regional selectivity, and has been found to increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels and decrease serotonin levels in the rat prefrontal cortex, actions that were determined to be mediated by activation of the 5-HT1A receptor. As such, <b>flibanserin</b> {{has been described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitor (NDDI).|$|E
50|$|Another {{drug that}} has been {{referred}} to as an NDDI in the medical literature is <b>flibanserin,</b> which is approved as a treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women. <b>Flibanserin</b> disinhibits norepinephrine and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex by activating 5-HT1A receptors in this area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flibanserin</b> was {{originally}} developed as an antidepressant, before being repurposed {{for the treatment}} of HSDD.|$|E

50|$|A {{few studies}} suggest that the antidepressant, bupropion, can improve sexual {{function}} in women who are not depressed, if they have HSDD. The same is true for the anxiolytic, buspirone, which is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist similarly to <b>flibanserin.</b>|$|E
50|$|On June 4, 2015, the US FDA Advisory Committee, which {{includes}} the Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (BRUDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSRM), recommended approval of the drug by 18-6, {{with the proviso that}} measures be taken to inform women of the drug's side effects. On August 18, 2015 the FDA approved Addyi (<b>Flibanserin)</b> for the treatment of premenopausal women with low sexual desire that causes personal distress or relationship difficulties. The approval specified that <b>flibanserin</b> should not be used to treat low sexual desire caused by co-existing psychiatric or medical problems; low sexual desire caused by problems in the relationship; or low sexual desire due to medication side effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, gepirone {{has been found to}} improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction in men and women, similarly to the marketed 5-HT1A receptor agonist <b>flibanserin.</b> Moreover, the pro-sexual effects appear to be independent of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.|$|E
50|$|Sprout {{responded to}} the FDA's cited {{deficiencies}} and refiled the NDA in 2013. The submission included data from a new Phase 3 trial and several Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies. The FDA again refused the application, citing an uncertain risk/benefit ratio. In December 2013, a Formal Dispute Resolution was filed, which contained {{the requirements of the}} FDA for further studies. These include two studies in healthy subjects to determine if <b>flibanserin</b> impairs their ability to drive, and to determine if it interferes with other biochemical pathways. The Agency agreed to call a new Advisory Committee meeting to consider whether the risk-benefit ratio of <b>flibanserin</b> was favorable after this additional data was obtained. Sprout expected to resubmit the New Drug Application (NDA) in the 3rd quarter of 2014.|$|E
50|$|The libido-enhancing {{effects of}} {{dopamine}} agonists prescribed {{for other purposes}} {{has led to the}} development of a number of more selective compounds such as <b>flibanserin,</b> ABT-670 and PF-219,061, which have been developed specifically for the treatment of sexual dysfunction disorders, although none of them have yet passed clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>flibanserin</b> was evaluated in three phase 3 clinical trials. Each {{of the three}} trials had two co-primary endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) {{and the other for}} sexual desire. Each of the 3 trials also had a secondary endpoint that measured distress related to sexual desire. All three trials showed that <b>flibanserin</b> produced {{an increase in the number}} of SSEs and reduced distress related to sexual desire. The first two trials used an electronic diary to measure sexual desire, and did not find an increase. These two trials also measured sexual desire using the Female Sexual Function index (FSFI) as a secondary endpoint, and an increase was observed using this latter measure. The FSFI was used as the co-primary endpoint for sexual desire in the third trial, and again showed a statistically significant increase.|$|E
50|$|Fugh-Berman {{has been}} {{critical}} of multiple popular pharmaceutical drugs and treatments, such as testosterone replacement therapy and <b>flibanserin.</b> She has also criticized how the numerical values used to diagnose diabetes and high cholesterol have been lowered over time, and has criticized Eli Lilly for allegedly inventing premenstrual dysphoric disorder to sell its drug Sarafem.|$|E
50|$|Aside from agomelatine, fluoxetine, and <b>flibanserin,</b> as of present, {{no other}} drugs have been {{described}} as NDDIs in the medical literature, despite the fact that many other existing drugs possess effects consistent with those of the definition of an NDDI. In any case, more drugs labeled specifically as NDDIs may be seen in the future.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flibanserin</b> is {{the first}} and only {{medication}} approved for women for the treatment of HSDD. It is only slightly effective over placebo, having been found to increase the average number of satisfying sexual events per month by 0.5 to 1.

5000|$|On June 18, 2010, {{a federal}} {{advisory}} panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously voted against recommending approval of <b>flibanserin,</b> citing an inadequate risk-benefit ratio. The Committee acknowledged {{the validity of}} hypoactive sexual desire as a diagnosis, but expressed concern with the drug's side effects and insufficient evidence for efficacy, especially the drug's failure to show a statistically {{significant effect on the}} co-primary endpoint of sexual desire. Earlier in the week, a FDA staff report also recommended non-approval of the drug. Ahead of the votes, Boehringer Ingelheim had mounted a publicity campaign to promote the controversial disorder of [...] "hypoactive sexual desire". In 2010 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, stating that New Drug Application could not be approved in its current form. The letter cited several concerns, including the failure to demonstrate a statistical effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire and overly restrictive entry criteria for the two Phase 3 trials. The Agency recommended performing a new Phase 3 trial with less restrictive entry criteria. On October 8, 2010, Boehringer announced that it would discontinue its development of <b>flibanserin</b> in light of the FDA's decision.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists like buspirone and flesinoxan show efficacy in relieving {{anxiety and}} depression, and buspirone and tandospirone are currently approved for these indications {{in various parts}} of the world. Others such as gepirone, flesinoxan, <b>flibanserin,</b> and naluzotan have also been investigated, though none have been fully developed and approved yet. Some of the atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole are also partial agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor and are sometimes used in low doses as augmentations to standard antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{mechanism of}} action refers to the Kinsey dual control model of sexual response. Various neurotransmitters, sex steroids, and other hormones have important excitatory or inhibitory effects on the sexual response. Among neurotransmitters, excitatory activity is driven by dopamine and norepinephrine, while inhibitory activity is driven by serotonin. The balance between these systems is of significance for a normal sexual response. By modulating serotonin and dopamine activity {{in certain parts of}} the brain, <b>flibanserin</b> may improve the balance between these neurotransmitter systems in the regulation of sexual response.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{response}} since the 2015 introduction of <b>flibanserin</b> to the U.S. market was slow with 227 prescriptions written {{during the first}} three weeks. The slow response may be related to a number of factors: physicians require an about 10 minute online training to get certified, women are not allowed to drink alcohol, the medication has to be taken daily and is costly, about US$800 per month, and questions about the drug's efficacy and need. Prescriptions for the drug continue to be few and far between with less than 4,000 being made as of February 2016 ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{approval}} {{was opposed}} by the National Women's Health Network, the National Center for Health Research and Our Bodies Ourselves.

Albino BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle or increasing doses of <b>flibanserin</b> ranging from 0. 75 to 15 mg/kg <b>flibanserin.</b> To assess 5 -HT 1 A-mediated effects, BALB/c mice were injected with 10 mg/kg WAY 100635, a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, prior to 6 mg/kg <b>flibanserin</b> and 5 -HT 1 A knockout mice were injected with 6 mg/kg <b>flibanserin.</b> Injections were administered once {{immediately prior to}} light exposure or {{over the course of}} five days. Light exposure lasted for one hour at an intensity of 10, 000 lux. Retinal structure was assessed using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and retinal function was assessed using electroretinography. To investigate the mechanisms of flibanserin-mediated neuroprotection, gene expression, measured by RT-qPCR, was assessed following five days of daily 15 mg/kg <b>flibanserin</b> injections. A five-day treatment regimen of 3 to 15 mg/kg of <b>flibanserin</b> significantly preserved outer retinal structure and function in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, a single-day treatment regimen of 6 to 15 mg/kg of <b>flibanserin</b> still provided significant protection. The action of <b>flibanserin</b> was hindered by the 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, WAY 100635, and was not effective in 5 -HT 1 A knockout mice. Creb, c-Jun, c-Fos, Bcl- 2, Cast 1, Nqo 1, Sod 1, and Cat were significantly increased in flibanserin-injected mice versus vehicle-injected mice. Intraperitoneal delivery of <b>flibanserin</b> in a light-induced retinopathy mouse model provides retinal neuroprotection. Mechanistic data suggests that this effect is mediated through 5 -HT 1 A receptors and that <b>flibanserin</b> augments the expression of genes capable of reducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Since <b>flibanserin</b> is already FDA-approved for other indications, the potential to repurpose this drug for treating retinal degenerations merits further investigation...|$|E

Randomized clinical trials assessing treatment effects of <b>flibanserin</b> in premenopausal and postmenopausal women were eligible. No age, language, or date restrictions were applied. Abstract and full-text selection was done by 2 independent reviewers. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Results were pooled using 2 approaches depending on the blinding risk of bias. Primary efficacy outcomes included number of satisfying sexual events (SSEs), eDiary sexual desire, and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) desire. Safety outcomes included, among others, 4 common adverse events (AEs) : dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and fatigue. Five published and 3 unpublished studies including 5914 women were included. Pooled mean differences for SSE change from baseline were 0. 49 (95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 67) between 100 -mg <b>flibanserin</b> and placebo, 1. 63 (95 % CI, 0. 45 - 2. 82) for eDiary desire, and 0. 27 (95 % CI, 0. 17 - 0. 38) for FSFI desire. The risk ratio for study discontinuation due to AEs was 2. 19 (95 % CI, 1. 50 - 3. 20).

40|$|Introduction.   Psychopathological {{origins of}} {{personally}} distressing, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women are unknown, but are generally attributed to an inhibitory neural regulator, serotonin (5 ‐HT). <b>Flibanserin,</b> a 5 ‐HT 1 A agonist and 5 ‐HT 2 A antagonist, shows promise {{as a treatment}} for HSDD. Aim.   To test the hypothesis that female marmoset sexual behavior is enhanced by <b>flibanserin</b> and diminished by 8 ‐OH‐DPAT, in order to evaluate the efficacy of serotonergic modulation of female sexual behavior in a pairmate social setting comparable to humans. Methods.   Sexual and social behavior were examined in eight female marmoset monkeys receiving daily <b>flibanserin</b> (15  mg/kg), 8 ‐OH‐DPAT (0. 1  mg/kg), or corresponding vehicle for 15 – 16 weeks in a counterbalanced, within‐subject design, while housed in long‐term, stable male–female pairs. Main Outcome Measures.   Marmoset pairmate interactions, including sexual and social behavior, were scored during weeks 5 – 6 of daily <b>flibanserin,</b> 8 ‐OH‐DPAT or vehicle treatment. 24 ‐hour pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs and their metabolites, as well as drug‐induced acute symptoms of the 5 ‐HT behavioral syndrome were also assessed. Results.   Two‐way analysis of variance reveals that flibanserin‐treated females attract more male sexual interest (P  =  0. 020) and trigger increased grooming (P  =  0. 001) between partners. In contrast, 8 ‐OH‐DPAT‐treated females show increased rejection of male sexual advances (P  =  0. 024), a tendency for decreased male sexual interest (P  =  0. 080), and increased aggression with their male pairmates (P  =  0. 049). Conclusions.   While 8 ‐OH‐DPAT‐treated female marmosets display decreased sexual receptivity and increased aggressive interactions with their male pairmates, flibanserin‐treated female marmosets demonstrate increased affiliative behavior with their male pairmates. Such pro‐affiliation attributes may underlie flibanserin's effectiveness in treating HSDD in women.

40|$|Female sexual {{disorders}} {{are increasingly being}} recognized in the population and hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) {{is one of the}} commonest sexual disorders among females. The prevalence of the disease varies between 10 - 20 % in the Caucasian population. Testosterone is the only treatment that is approved by the European Medical Agency. <b>Flibanserin</b> is a drug that has been approved by the US FDA for HSDD among pre-menopausal women in 2015. <b>Flibanserin</b> is a 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist and 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist that rebalances the neural circuitry involved in processing sexual desire by reducing serotonin activity and enhancing dopamine and epinephrine activity. The efficacy of the drug was confirmed in three pivotal randomized placebo control trials in premenopausal women who consumed the drug for 24 weeks. There was a significant improvement in the number of sexually satisfying events. The most common safety concerns for <b>flibanserin</b> as seen in clinical trials were somnolence, hypotension and syncope. The drug is prescribed at a dose of 100 mg once daily at bed time. The marginal efficacy of the drug coupled with other safety concerns, such as hypo-tensions have given room for much criticism over the drug's approval by the FDA. Nevertheless, on a positive note the serendipitous discovery of <b>flibanserin</b> and its repurposing for HSDD is a compelling narrative in its drug development history. It {{remains to be seen if}} the long term safety of the molecule and the efficacy of the molecule in non-trial settings could make it an attractive pharmaco-therapeutic option for HSDD.

40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{antidepressant}} drugs {{may be related to}} mechanisms of receptor adaptation, involving overall the serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor subtype. However, so far, the clinical effectiveness of selective compounds acting at this level has proved disappointing. This could be explained by the heterogeneity of 5 -HT 1 A receptors within the central nervous system. In animals, two 5 -HT 1 A agonists, <b>flibanserin</b> and buspirone, have shown different pharmacological properties, depending on the brain region. Since no evidence supports this observation in humans, this study sought to investigate whether these two drugs exert different effects on 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation in three different human brain areas: the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei. 5 -HT 1 A-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) was taken as an index of 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation. <b>Flibanserin</b> significantly reduced the activity of AC post-synaptically, i. e. in the prefrontal cortex [EC 50 (mean +/-S. E. M.), 28 +/- 10. 2 nm; E-max, 18 +/- 2. 3 %] and in the hippocampus (EC 50, 3. 5 +/- 3. 1 nm; E-max, 20 +/- 4. 0 %), but had no effect in the raphe nuclei, i. e. at pre-synaptic level. Vice versa, buspirone was only slightly but significantly effective in the raphe (EC 50, 3. 0 +/- 2. 8 nm; E-max, 12 +/- 1. 9 %). Agonist effects were sensitive to the 5 -HT 1 A antagonists WAY- 100135 and pindobind 5 -HT 1 A in the cortex and raphe nuclei, whereas buspirone antagonized <b>flibanserin</b> in the hippocampus.
