5|$|SIM Lite {{measurements}} of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass potential, and {{mass of the}} Galaxy to large radii. The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine {{the distance from the}} Sun to the galactic center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would have attempted to determine the mass of the galactic disk.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{regulation}} {{refers to}} the control of when an organism transitions between sleep and wakefulness. The <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> here are to identify which {{parts of the brain}} are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and wakefulness seems to follow an electronic flip-flop model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the flip-flop, in the case of sleep, {{there seems to be a}} timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an unstable state. The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent.|$|E
25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought have emerged {{surrounding}} several <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded the way they did, why it began in the first place, and what it was. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition {{by a series of}} grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal {{at the beginning of the}} movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.|$|E
25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine under what conditions the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.|$|E

Williams had tried to enter the NFL draft a year early during the Maurice Clarett trial when it was ruled that the NFL could not deny them entering the draft. The decision was appealed and overturned leaving Williams unable to enter the draft. When he applied to the NCAA for reinstatement of his eligibility, it was denied.|$|E
25|$|In , Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) {{discuss the}} current debates on macroeconomics, capital market {{liberalization}} and development, {{and develop a}} new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E
