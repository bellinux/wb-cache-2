40|$|Machining of Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC), {{particularly}} drilling {{is frequently}} employed in many industries especially {{when dealing with}} joining, assembly and structural repair of the parts. This paper summarizes {{the properties of the}} CFC as well as the appropriate material and geometry of the cutting tool that should be used when drilling of the CFC in order to optimize the drilling performance. In addition, this work also presents the literature review on the relationship between cutting speed, feed rate, tool wear, thrust force and damage of the drilled CFC. The nature and heterogeneous structure of CFC often resulted in difficulty during their machining in terms of rapid tool wear and high thrust force. As a result, this always results in the damage of the <b>drilled</b> <b>parts.</b> Furthermore, higher cutting speed and lower feed rate are also recognized as significant factors which contribute to rapid wear of the cutting tool. Therefore, the use of tungsten carbide cutting tools, cutting fluids and cryogenic machining is seen to be a practical technique in optimizing the drilling performance involving CFC. In general, this work intends to provide a basic guideline and understanding regarding drilling of the CFC. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The forging process {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the automotive industry thanks to the good mechanical properties of the forged parts. Nowadays, due to the European policy of increasing efficiency in raw material and energy usage, the metal forming sector is demanding new innovative technologies. In this context, rotary extrusion technology is a very promising metal forming alternative to the drilling techniques after forging processes. The presented work is focused on hollow shafts that are usually manufactured using a combination of forming and metal cutting techniques. Deep drilling is the most common technique to obtain internal holes in the automotive hollow parts, but it is an expensive process in terms of material usage. In this framework, rotary extrusion appears as an alternative technology that leads to the reduction of material usage and process time. The tubular shape is formed with the combination of two forming processes: flow forming and backward extrusion. This paper presents the development of a simulation methodology, the process design for a hollow part, the specifications of the experimental unit, and the manufactured prototypes in order to validate the simulation model. Also the incremental process is improved thanks to a sensitivity study of the rollers geometry. Rotary extrusion experiments are done using a modified flow forming machine and 20 % material saving is achieved when obtaining the deep hole in comparison to the current deep drilling technology. The process design and numerical model tasks carried out try to provide the industry manufacturers an alternative technology to <b>drilled</b> <b>parts</b> considering the advantages of rotary extrusion parts...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that soil erosion by water causes {{considerable}} on-site and off-site problems, farmers in Europe are reluctant to adopt prevention and control measures when such measures require additional labour and material inputs. This paper documents the impact of multiple sowing of small grains on concentrated flow erosion rates and grain production for a winter triticale field (X Triticosecale Wittmack ex. A. Camus) in the Belgian loess belt. Multiple sowing refers to drilling {{more than once in}} zones of concentrated flow erosion in order to increase the total root mass in this zone. Multiple sowing strongly altered the morphology of erosion channels and reduced soil loss significantly. Statistical analysis confirmed that differences in channel dimensions could be explained by the seedling density. Doubling the root mass in the topsoil by multiple sowing' resulted on average in a reduction of soil loss by 42 % for the whole growing season. For the winter period, soil loss reduction, mainly attributed to the triticale roots, amounted even to 53 %, showing the tremendous impact of seedling roots on soil erosion by concentrated overland flow {{in the early stages of}} vegetation growth. Furthermore, total grain yield in the multiple drilled zones was not significantly smaller compared to the conventionally <b>drilled</b> <b>parts</b> of the field. Grain size of cereals was slightly smaller. The results of this case study indicate that double sowing in concentrated overland flow zones may be a viable soil erosion control technique.

40|$|Geochemical anomaly {{detection}} {{is an important}} issue in mineral exploration. The availability of a training dataset consisting of labeled geochemical samples of background and anomaly classes enables us to define a supervised pattern recognition framework for geochemical {{anomaly detection}}. Therefore, various classification and feature selection algorithms can be utilized to build a predictive model and classify the unseen geochemical samples into the pre-defined anomaly and background classes. In this study, some of the state-of-art feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized for supervised anomaly detection in the Kuh Panj porphyry-Cu district. Filter, wrapper and embedded mode feature selection algorithms were used to remove redundant and irrelevant elements from the classification procedure. Subsequently, AdaBoost (ADB), support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained with borehole and surface rock samples from the <b>drilled</b> <b>parts</b> of the study area to create a classified map depicting anomalous areas in the undrilled parts of the district. Results show that feature selection algorithms could {{play an important role in}} increasing the accuracy and generalization ability of the classifiers used. Wrapper mode subset selection method combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) search method resulted in the best performance in the study area. Applied classification algorithms outperform Gaussian linear discriminant analysis (GLDA) and provide more accurate, robust and reliable results. Among the applied classification methods, ADB achieved the best leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) error rate of 0. 06. Meanwhile, comparison of the resulted classified map using ADB with another one created via concentration–area fractal model indicated advantage of the former one in terms of detecting high-promising prospective target areas in the study region...|$|E
40|$|The Podlesí granite {{stock in}} western Krušné hory Mts. {{represents}} {{the most highly}} fractionated part of the late Variscan Nejdek-Eibenstock pluton. Internal fabric of the stock has been studied in several boreholes up to 350 m deep. The stock is composed of two tongue-like bodies of albite-protolithionite-topaz granite (stock granite) coalesced at depth, which were emplaced into Ordovician phyllite and biotite granite of younger intrusive complex (YIC) of the Nejdek pluton. The uppermost part of the intrusion is bordered by a layer of marginal pegmatite (stockscheider) up to 50 cm thick. Explosive breccia was found as an isolated block at the southwest contact of the stock. It is comprised of fragments of phyllite several millimetres to 5 cm in size cemented with fine-grained granitic matrix similar to the stock granite, but very fine-grained. Within the uppermost 100 m, the stock granite is intercalated with several mostly flat-lying dykes of albite-zinnwaldite-topaz granite (dyke granite). Upper and lower contacts of the dykes are sharp, flat, but in detail slightly uneven. The thickest dyke (about 7 m) outcrops in an old quarry. A prominent example of layering with unidirectional solidification textures (UST) {{was found in the}} upper part of this major dyke. Individual Q-Afs laminae are separated by comb quartz layers and/or by layers of oriented fan-like zinnwaldite aggregates. A pegmatite-like layer with oriented megacrysts of Kfs up to 6 cm long was encountered in the uppermost part of the dyke. One thin layer of fine-grained quartz with oriented Kfs-megacrysts was found within the stock granite. Post-magmatic processes, particularly greisenisation, developed only to a limited degree. The uppermost flat dyke of the dyke granite was partly greisenised into white quartz-rich (+topaz, Li-mica, wolframite) greisen. Scarce thin, steep stringers of biotite greisen were encountered over the entire outcrop and in <b>drilled</b> <b>parts</b> of the stock granite and surrounding biotite granite. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools a process called , or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when {{the depth of the}} hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the <b>drill</b> <b>part</b> way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.|$|R
