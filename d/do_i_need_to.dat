500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
500|$|Kapadia {{separated}} from Khanna in April 1982, {{leaving the house}} with her two daughters back to her parents. She returned to acting two years later. In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, [...] "The life and happiness in our house {{came to an end}} the day I and Rajesh got married," [...] sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage [...] "a farce". Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to marry again, Kapadia replied, [...] "I'm very happy and content. Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get married again? Once was more than enough." [...] In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that [...] "the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her [...] "biggest high".|$|E

[...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> talk about that? I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I {{think it was a}} miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and then he just tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E

[...] "In no way <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be ashamed of the fact that I was able to reveal new data from the bodies of the executed, facts that were unknown before and are now recognized by the whole world." [...] He denied, however, that the executed victims he had done his research on were political prisoners. After his death the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities acknowledged the criticism of Stieve's work in the obituary it published in its yearbook. It felt compelled to put to rest [...] "spiteful false accusations" [...] by pointing out that Stieve had never set foot in a concentration camp, nor had he made any request to the prison administration that [...] "this or that should happen" [...] before the execution. The bodies he dissected, it claimed, were either victims of accidents or common criminals lawfully sentenced to death.|$|E

The idea in this essay is to try to answer those questions for the Ph. D. student of today while fitting within the limit of ten papers.

2500|$|In July 1954, Perkins and {{his wife}} heard a new release of [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] by Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black on the radio.

"It is," [...] {{said the}} preacher--in tones not loud, but so deep and {{impressive}} that every soul {{was at once}} enthralled--"it is to the servants of the devil that the grand message comes. Not to the good, and pure, and holy is the blessed Gospel or good news sent, but, to the guilty, the sin-stricken, the bad, and the sin-weary God has sent by His blessed Spirit the good and glorious news that there is deliverance in Jesus Christ for the chief of sinners. Deliverance from sin changes godless men into the children of God, and there is rest for these. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> tell toilers of the deep how sweet rest is to the tired-out body? Surely not, because you have felt it, and {{know all about it}} better than I do. But it is needful to tell you about rest for the soul, because some of you have never felt it, and know not what it is. Is there no man before me who has, some time or other, committed some grievous sin, whose soul groans under the burden of the thought, and who would give all he possesses if he had never put out his hand to commit that sin? Is there no one here under the power of that deadly monster-- strong drink--who, remembering the days when he was free from bondage, would sing this day with joy unspeakable if he could only escape?" ...|$|E

At the same time, as an academic who writes normative and historical articles and books about copyright, and who tries to explain to her students why the statute works, or fails to work, the way it <b>does,</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be pretty well grounded in copyright theory and in the normative premises that are supposed to underlie the law...|$|R

40|$|IT HAS {{to be the}} English-speaking world’s most {{distinctive}} and unsettling contribution to election campaigns: the political family happy-snap. The candidate stands awkwardly alongside loved ones – {{more often than not}} a wife and two-point-something kids in their Sunday best.

They might be sitting around the kitchen table or out in the garden having a barbecue, enjoying some authentic family time while offering the camera a forced smile.
