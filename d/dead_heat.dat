5|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> in the {{lightweight}} {{section of the}} weightlifting competition resulted in gold medals being awarded to both Austria's Robert Fein and Egypt's Anwar Mesbah, and resulted in a silver medal not being awarded for that event. A <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> for third place in the floor competition of the gymnastic events resulted in bronze medals going to both Germany's Konrad Frey and Eugen Mack of Switzerland. This resulted in 130 gold and bronze medals being awarded, but only 128 silver medals.|$|E
5|$|B. Johann Mühlegg of Spain {{originally}} won the 10km/10km pursuit, but {{nine days}} after the race he failed a doping test following his gold medal win in the 50km classical race. In 2003, a CAS ruling against Mühlegg allowed the International Olympic Committee to strip him of his other medals. Norwegians Frode Estil and Thomas Alsgaard, who had originally tied in a <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> for silver, were promoted to gold, while fourth-placed Per Elofsson was promoted to bronze.|$|E

In 1884 he was {{involved}} in the second and final <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> in the history of The Derby, part of an unbeaten sequence of twelve races. St. Gatien {{went on to become a}} dominant performer in long distance races, winning the Gold Cup and the Alexandra Plate at Royal Ascot, the Cesarewitch Handicap carrying a record weight, and three successive running of the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E

As a three-year-old in 1817 he won the Riddlesworth Stakes at Newmarket and a Produce Sweepstakes at Doncaster.

5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak at a <b>dead</b> <b>heat,</b> with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent undecided, whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, {{with about a}} quarter of voters undecided. In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{two people}} were {{interested}} in buying the track: Fred Weisman, a California businessman, and former National Football League player Mark May. Weisman out-bid May and purchased Rosecroft out of bankruptcy for $18.2 million. On November 23 of the same year, the grandstand caught fire {{a few hours before}} live racing began. In Weisman's first full season of operations, Rosecroft experienced a 10.5 percent increase in handle and an 8.3 percent increase in attendance. In 1992, Western Hanover, the richest horse of that year, won two of the three Triple Crown races, including the Messenger Stakes at Rosecroft. Rosecroft Raceway went into the record books on October 10, 1992, when a three-horse <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> occurred in the seventh race. It was the 17th time in harness-racing history and the first time in Maryland history.|$|E

5|$|In the judo competition, an {{additional}} thirteen bronze medals were awards as the losing competitors {{in both of}} the semi finals were each awarded a medal rather than having a playoff bout to decide the medallist. The swimming also saw multiple instances of the same medals being awarded, in the women's 100m backstroke S10, both Sophie Pascoe and Shireen Sapiro swam a <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> in the final and were both awarded a gold medal, resulting in no silver medal being given that for event. In both the women's 400, freestyle S13 and the men's 100m butterfly S11, two bronze medals were awarded each as two swimmers set {{the same time in}} third place.|$|E
5|$|When Marsh's cricket career {{ended in}} 1905, he resumed {{professional}} sprinting; in 1906, he ran against Arthur Postle {{at a meeting}} organised by John Wren in Melbourne. The race was organised to give Postle, then Australia's fastest man, a chance to break the 100-yard world record. In front of 12,000 spectators on a wet track, Marsh starting from a two-yard start maintained an early lead until Postle caught him on the line. Postle was declared the winner with a 10-second time, but some observers claimed {{that it was a}} <b>dead</b> <b>heat.</b> He retired from competitive sport after the race.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E

Up against nine rivals, including Middle Park Plate conqueror Albert Victor (who also <b>dead</b> <b>heated</b> for second in the Derby), Hannah was sent off the 9/4 favourite and won by a length.

25|$|In the 1940 election, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) {{finished}} in a <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> with the Liberal Party. Luis Muñoz Marin of the PPD brokered {{an alliance with}} minor Puerto Rican factions so as to secure his position as Senate president; such coalition-building was fundamental to the multi-party society. The elections in 1944 and 1948 resulted in greater victory margins for the PPD; nearly all the legislative posts and mayoral races in Puerto Rico were won by PPD candidates.|$|E
25|$|In September, Packwood pulled {{ads that}} had falsely criticized AuCoin for missing votes while {{speaking}} to special interest groups. By October, Packwood had raised $8 million, spending $5.4 {{million more than}} AuCoin, and leading all Senate incumbents. Yet that fall, the two candidates were in a <b>dead</b> <b>heat,</b> with Packwood continuing to criticize AuCoin on attendance, his House bank account and the spotted owl, and AuCoin echoing the campaign of popular presidential candidate Bill Clinton by accusing Packwood of favoring the wealthy over the middle class.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{independent}} polls had shown Shays defeating or in <b>dead</b> <b>heat</b> {{with the top}} Democratic contenders in the general election, while those same polls show McMahon losing handily {{to each of the}} top Democratic contenders. The Shays campaign asserted the former Congressman showed more electability than McMahon, due to her loss in an open Senate seat contest in 2010 by a large margin despite spending $50 million of her own money, also citing her high unfavorable numbers among state voters, and the weak fundraising numbers of the McMahon campaign.|$|E
50|$|Sceptre {{changed hands}} several more times, being owned by Edmund Somerville Tattersall of the Tattersalls family, John Musker and finally Lord Glanely. She {{produced}} eight foals (one colt and seven fillies), and {{although none of}} her offspring were of her quality, four of her daughters won races. One of them, Maid of the Mist, established a bloodline which {{could be found in}} classic winners Relko, April the Fifth and Craig An Eran. She remains the only horse to have won four British Classics outright - Formosa won the same four classics as Sceptre in 1868 but <b>dead</b> <b>heated</b> for the 2,000 Guineas.|$|R

The last three races we have been in we have been separated by a total of 0.05 seconds highlighting how good this rivalry is." ...|$|R

In 17 of the races he contested he won eight by a neck or less, lost four by a neck or less and figured in five <b>dead</b> <b>heats</b> for first. He always pulled hard in races, which cost him any chance in the three Melbourne Cups he contested.|$|R
