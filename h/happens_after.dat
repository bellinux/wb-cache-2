5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} theoretic {{paradigms}} of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer {{when exposed to}} contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, ideals, and values; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> a person acts inconsistently, relative {{to his or her}} prior intellectual perspectives; what <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested to a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{cognitive}} psychologists {{carry out}} research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., A or else B. They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., A is {{to the left of}} B, or A <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> B, and about quantified assertions, e.g., All the A are B. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.|$|E

25|$|If {{the player}} {{does not agree}} with the report, he can seek a hearing from a bowling review group made up of experts {{appointed}} by the ICC. This group will review evidence and decide, by a simple majority vote, on the legality of the player's action. If the player is cleared the suspension will be lifted immediately. A player who has been suspended from international cricket can continue to play domestic cricket under the supervision of his cricket Board. A player who has been suspended can at any time apply for a reassessment of his action. This usually <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> the player has completed a period of remedial work on his action. This reassessment is carried out {{in the same manner as}} the independent review. If the review concludes that the player has remedied his action his suspension will be lifted with immediate effect and he can start bowling in international cricket.|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E

However, Craig Reedie, a British IOC member, dismissed these words, commenting that a claim [...] "that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> many an IOC vote'." ...|$|E
