5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts <b>into</b> <b>words,</b> and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|Wohlwend {{began to}} {{collaborate}} with Asher Vollmer when Vollmer reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice on a game he was designing, Puzzlejuice. The game {{has been compared to}} a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching, where tetromino blocks fall {{from the top of the}} screen that players turn into letters and rearrange <b>into</b> <b>words.</b> Wohlwend and Vollmer communicated nonverbally through the entire development process via a 365-message email chain. Vollmer served as the game's programmer, Wohlwend as the artist, and Jimmy Hinson as the composer. Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10, a spotlighted group of indie games, in July 2012. It was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19, 2012.|$|E

25|$|Stuttering is {{generally}} not {{a problem with the}} physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts <b>into</b> <b>words.</b> Acute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem {{in the manner of a}} positive feedback system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition. Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to stuttering.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is descriptive qualitative research. The {{objectives of the}} research are to identify the translation shift of noun phrase and to describe the shift pattern of noun phrase translation in The Journey 2 Movie subtitle. The data are noun phrases found in The Journey 2 Movie subtitle. The researcher uses documentation as the method of collecting the data. The result of the {{research is}} from 334 data, there are 136 data belong to translation shift of noun phrase. The researcher finds two types of translation shift, they are level shift and structure shift. Level shift of noun phrase is divided into five parts, the first is noun phrase that is translated into clause, the shift pattern which occurs in this translation is from phrase changes into clause. Secondly, noun phrase is translated into noun, the shift pattern is from phrase changes <b>into</b> <b>word</b> or noun. The third is noun phrase that is translated into adjective, the shift pattern in this translation is from phrase changes <b>into</b> <b>word</b> or adjective. The fourth is noun phrase is translated into verb, the shift pattern which occurs is from phrase <b>into</b> <b>word</b> or verb. And the last is noun phrase that is translated into adverb, its shift pattern is from phrase changes <b>into</b> <b>word</b> or adverb. Then structural shift contains three parts, noun phrase is translated into adjective phrase, noun phrase is translated into verb phrase and noun phrase is translated into prepositional phrase.

Computational models demonstrate the in-principle plausibility of this statistical learning solution and experimental evidence shows that infants can aggregate and make statistically appropriate decisions from word–referent co-occurrence data. We review these contributions and then identify the gaps in current knowledge that prevent a confident conclusion about whether cross-situational learning is the mechanism through which infants break <b>into</b> <b>word</b> learning. We propose an agenda to address that gap that focuses on detailing the statistics in the learning environment and the cognitive processes that make use of those statistics...|$|R

500|$|In {{obscuring}} reality, truth becomes unclear. As {{literary critic}} Mireille Rosello notes, {{it is the}} President who decides what is true, denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike {{the characters in the}} novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality that no longer exists under the dictatorship of the President. [...] "Truth" [...] does not exist before the President puts it <b>into</b> <b>words,</b> and even at that, the only [...] "truth" [...] under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given momentone cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events.

500|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} GR is that syllables which form words should be written together. This strikes speakers of European languages as obvious; but in Chinese {{the concept of}} [...] "word" [...] {{is not easy to}} pin down. The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the monosyllable represented by a character ( [...] tzyh, zì), which in most cases represents a meaningful syllable or morpheme, a smaller unit than the [...] "linguistic word". Characters are written and printed with no spaces between words; yet in practice most Chinese words consist of two-syllable compounds, and it was Chao's bold innovation in 1922 to reflect this in GR orthography by grouping the appropriate syllables together <b>into</b> <b>words.</b> This represented a radical departure from hyphenated Wade–Giles forms such as Kuo2-yü3 Lo2-ma3-tzu4 (the Wade spelling of GR).|$|E

500|$|In Puzzlejuice, {{the player}} turns falling tetrominos into letters, and those letters <b>into</b> <b>words</b> and points. The player taps and drags on the {{touchscreen}} to rotate and position multicolored tetrominos that {{fall from the}} top of the screen. When the player completes a solid row of tiles, or arranges the fallen blocks such that four or more like-colored tiles touch, the color tiles turn into letters. Players connect these letter tiles with their eight adjacent tiles (in ordinal directions) to make words. Words of sufficient length are cleared from play as well as their adjacent tiles—thus longer words clear more blocks. The iPhone version shows a magnified version of the tile obscured by the player's finger near the finger. The game has been compared to a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching.|$|E
