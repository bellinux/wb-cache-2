5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of <b>its</b> <b>edges.</b> It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) {{is short}} {{compared to the}} physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more important than those at <b>its</b> <b>edges,</b> where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E
5|$|Forming a minor of a pseudoforest by {{contracting}} some of <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> and deleting others produces another pseudoforest. Therefore, {{the family}} of pseudoforests is closed under minors, and the Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that pseudoforests can be characterized {{in terms of a}} finite set of forbidden minors, analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as minors.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to land on <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even {{on a flat surface}} it {{is possible}} for a coin to land on <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|R
5|$|The pseudoarboricity of a graph G {{is defined}} by analogy to the arboricity as the minimum number of pseudoforests into which <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> can be partitioned; equivalently, it is the minimum k such that G is (k,0)-sparse, or the minimum k such that the edges of G can be {{oriented}} to form a directed graph with outdegree at most k. Due to the matroid structure of pseudoforests, the pseudoarboricity may be computed in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E

Slightly further out is a narrow portion of the top, {{including}} <b>its</b> <b>edge.</b> The outward-bent portion of the tube, including <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> is still slightly further out. Furthest out is the 90-degree-bent portion of the flat surface.|$|R

5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of <b>its</b> <b>edges</b> by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
