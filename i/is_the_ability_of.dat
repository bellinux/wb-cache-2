5|$|Animal {{navigation}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{many animals}} {{to find their}} way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{research}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.|$|E
5|$|Homeostasis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> an {{open system}} to {{regulate}} its internal environment to maintain stable conditions {{by means of}} multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.|$|E
50|$|Across his work, {{recurring}} themes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> re-envisage common situations from {{an alternative}} point of view, to imagine {{himself into a}} completely different world and to realise the importance of story in establishing one's self-identity.|$|R
50|$|Grigsby {{expanded}} {{the game from}} Guadalcanal Campaign with many new features, such as transport aircraft, torpedo boats, and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to use paratroops once per game. Most important <b>of</b> all <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> aircraft to support ground troops in combat.|$|R
50|$|Another {{cost-saving}} measure <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{drive to}} test itself {{when it was}} initially powered on after being assembled in the factory. Unlike many competitive products, this required only a power connection, not a dedicated computer or test system.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Working memory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{the brain}} to {{maintain}} a temporary representation {{of information about the}} task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it {{has been referred to}} as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} to withhold appointment of Army or Navy ministers that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> greatest Achilles {{heel of the}} Meiji Constitution. That power, more than any single other issue, led to military domination over civilian government in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{important}} features <b>of</b> TinyMud <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> players to build and create their own rooms, objects, and puzzles in the game. <b>The</b> following <b>is</b> <b>the</b> original building commandset abridged from [...] "Three's Unabridged Dictionary of Commands" [...] by Chrysalis (1990).|$|R
40|$|Social robots {{may provide}} a {{solution}} to many societal challenges. One of their core qualities must <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> effectively influencing human behavior or attitudes. • As a basis for strong influence, persuasive robots can take {{on the role of}} a social actor that can build a relationship with its user...|$|R
5|$|Wetting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{a liquid}} to {{maintain}} {{contact with a}} solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two}} decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
25|$|In neuroscience, {{synaptic}} plasticity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, {{in response to}} increases or decreases in their activity.|$|E
25|$|Dispatchability or {{maneuverability}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a given {{power source}} to increase and decrease output quickly on demand. The concept {{is distinct from}} intermittency; dispatchability {{is one of several}} ways system operators match supply (generator's output) to system demand (technical loads).|$|E
50|$|One of its key {{features}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> users to choose any location on Earth to explore. <b>The</b> name YoubeQ <b>was</b> inspired by <b>the</b> word ubiquity, {{or the state}} of being everywhere at the same time. This name represents the vision of YoubeQ and the feature that distinguishes it from other communication platforms.|$|R
25|$|The game, as played {{during the}} early Middle Ages, was slow, with many games lasting for days. Some {{variations}} in rules began to change {{the shape of the}} game by 1300 AD. A notable, but initially unpopular, change <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pawn to move two places in the first move instead of one.|$|R
25|$|Another example <b>of</b> AMC's agility <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{management}} to squeeze {{money out of}} reluctant bankers, {{even in the face}} of bankruptcy. These core <b>abilities</b> helped save <b>the</b> company from collapse and after each obstacle, give it the wherewithal to keep it operating. Ironically, AMC was never stronger than just before its demise.|$|R
25|$|Also {{relatively}} non-controversial <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a {{state to}} try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to extradite their own citizens {{as a matter of}} law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.|$|E
25|$|According to Ronald Binns, {{there is}} {{probably}} no one explanation of the monster. A wide range of natural phenomena have been hypothesised, including otters, swimming deer, and unusual waves. Binns wrote that an aspect of human psychology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the eye {{to see what it}} wants, and expects, to see.|$|E
25|$|The {{same group}} of atoms can often solidify in many {{different}} ways. Polymorphism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a solid to exist {{in more than one}} crystal form. For example, water ice is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form Ice Ih, but can also exist as the cubic Ice Ic, the rhombohedral ice II, and many other forms. The different polymorphs are usually called different phases.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} building blocks of a workforce development system has long <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> teenagers to get jobs while on summer vacation. But the employment rate of teens in the summer has fallen dramatically in recent years. In fact, <b>the</b> decline <b>is</b> unprecedented, <b>the</b> authors find, and represents a "massive" underutilization of the country's capacities. ...|$|R
25|$|Antifouling <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{specifically}} designed materials and coatings to remove or prevent biofouling by {{any number of}} organisms on wetted surfaces. Since biofouling can occur almost anywhere water is present, biofouling poses risks {{to a wide variety}} of objects such as medical devices and membranes, as well as to entire industries, such as paper manufacturing, food processing, underwater construction, and desalination plants.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} of creative people, {{as measured by}} some psychologists, is what is called divergent production. Divergent production <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses {{to a variety of}} open-ended questions.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{substantial}} interplay between the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. At multiple stages of their respective signalling cascades, the two pathways can regulate each other. The best characterized example of this co-regulation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> caspase 8 to inhibit {{the formation of the}} necrosome by cleaving RIPK1. Conversely, caspase 8 inhibition of necroptosis can be bypassed by the necroptotic machinery through the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIP which inactivates caspase 8 through formation of a heterodimer.|$|E
5|$|At {{particular}} issue <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts {{argued that a}} more comprehensive compliance system would be necessary.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} factors in the penetration of marine animals into brackish water and eventually into fresh water has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells of the organism to withstand and adapt themselves to a very great reduction in the total concentra-tion of <b>the</b> blood.

40|$|For {{brushless}} {{doubly fed}} machines (BDFMs), {{a set of}} expressions suitable for implementing of maximum power factor and maximum torque per inverter ampere control were developed. One of the machine's main attributes <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> utility power factor control. Various trade-off's between performance and the inverter rating required to drive <b>the</b> machine <b>were</b> also focused...|$|R
25|$|Tolerance is a {{fundamental}} property of the immune system. Tolerance involves non-self discrimination which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Color vision <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> an {{organism}} or machine to distinguish objects {{based on the}} wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect, emit, or transmit. Colors can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the brain responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of cone cells in the eye. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{competence}} in research <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> researchers and research staff to provide high quality research {{that takes into}} account the culture and diversity of a population when developing research ideas, design, and methodology. Cultural competence can be crucial for ensuring that the sampling is representative of the population and therefore application to a diverse number of people. It is important that a study's subject enrollment reflect as closely as possible the target population of those affected by the health problem being studied.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aspect of}} {{paranoia}} that Dalí {{was interested in}} and which helped inspire <b>the</b> method <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain to perceive links between things which rationally are not linked. Dalí described the paranoiac-critical method as a [...] "spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the critical and systematic objectivity of the associations and interpretations of delirious phenomena." ...|$|R
