2500|$|January 14 on the Gregorian {{calendar}} {{corresponds to}} January 1, New Year's Day, on the Julian calendar; this holiday is also called Mali Božić [...] "Little Christmas". In some regions, {{the head and}} the right Boston butt of the pečenica are set aside at the Christmas dinner, and are served for dinner on this day. A part of this meal may consist of little round loaves made with cornmeal and cream. The loaves are named vasilica after Saint Basil the Great, because January 1 is also the feast day of this saint. People versed in scapulimancy used the shoulder blade of the Boston butt to foretell events concerning {{the family in the}} ensuing year. The snout cut from the head of pečenica could have been used in love magic. If a <b>girl</b> <b>looked</b> stealthily through the snout at a boy she wanted, who was not interested in her, he would supposedly go mad about her.|$|E
