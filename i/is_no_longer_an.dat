Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior was dangerous. Rita's grandmother <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 and <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to}} be generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60Â°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E
