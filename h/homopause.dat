The temperature in the model simulation of the data is 420 + or - 30 K down to about 1600 km. Below 1600 km the temperature decreases with a variable lapse rate down to 120 + or - 30 K near the methane <b>homopause</b> located at 1010 + or - 40 km. A constant temperature at 120 K is applied in the model for the region of the methane <b>homopause</b> down to 960 km where the present analysis terminates. Column amounts of H 2 and H were measured from 2900 km down to about 1100 km, giving respective densities of about 1. 0 x 10 to the 8 th/cu cm and about 5. 5 x 10 to the 6 th/cu cm near the exobase at 2500 km.

For Cupid's Arrow, the nanosat is designed to skim through the upper atmosphere, just below the <b>homopause,</b> in order to sample the atmosphere, perform the analysis, and then exit the atmosphere to transmit its data to the orbiting VERITAS spacecraft. Cupid's Arrow is a compelling addition to the VERITAS geology mission. A key missing link in our understanding of Venus' evolution is the noble gas abundances and their isotopic ratios. Not since Pioneer Venus have these measurements been made in the Venus atmosphere and never in the upper atmosphere, just below the <b>homopause,</b> to the degree of accuracy that will be accomplished by VERITAS' Cupid's Arrow nanosat.

For this modeling, we use constraints from several lower atmospheric Cassini‐Huygens investigations and validate our simulation results against in situ Cassini Ion‐Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measurements of N 2, CH 4, H 2, 40 Ar, HCN, and the major stable isotopic ratios of 14 N/ 15 N in N 2. We focus our investigation on aspects of Titan's upper atmosphere that {{determine the amount of}} atmospheric escape required to match the INMS measurements: the amount of turbulence, the inclusion of chemistry, and the effects of including a self‐consistent thermal balance. We systematically examine both hydrodynamic escape scenarios for methane and scenarios with significantly reduced atmospheric escape. Our results show that the optimum configuration of Titan's upper atmosphere is one with a methane <b>homopause</b> near 1000 km and atmospheric escape rates of 1. 41 – 1. 47 [*]× 10 11 CH 4 [*]m − 2 s − 1 and 1. 08 [*]× 10 14 [*]H 2 [*]m − 2 s − 1 (scaled relative to the surface).

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to explain diffuse FUV emissions from the outer planets, specifically Uranus, in excess of those diffuse emissions that are currently explainable by scattering of sunlight and/or excitation by photoelectrons.

An in situ mechanism for accelerating photoelectrons (and ions is proposed, involving neutral wind dynamo generation of field-aligned currents analogous to what occurs in the earth's equatorial E and F regions.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the diffuse FUV {{emissions}} of H and H 2 in excess of photoelectron excitation observed from the sunlit atmospheres of Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter are produced by electric field acceleration of photoelectrons and ions locally in the upper atmospheres. This in situ acceleration is required to satisfy the many observational constraints on the altitude distribution, exciting particle energy, and total input energy requirements of the electroglow mechanism. We further suggest that a primary mechanism leading to this acceleration is an ionospheric dynamo, which is created {{in the same manner}} as the Earth's dynamo. The calculated altitude of charge separation by the neutral wind drag on ions across magnetic field lines is consistent with the observed peaks in electroglow emissions from the the <b>homopause)</b> and Uranus (just Voyager ultraviolet spectrometer limb scan data on both Saturn (near • ' above the <b>homopause).</b> This dynamo action therefore appears to initiate the acceleration process, which must have the form of field-aligned potentials to accelerate the magnetized electrons.

40|$|High {{signal-to-noise}} {{spectra of}} the Jovian aurora at UV wavelengths obtained using the International Ultraviolet Explorer Observatory (including the brightest Jovian aurora observed to date) set strigent upper limits for sulfur and oxygen emissions, {{which would be}} associated with the precipitation of energetic heavy ions in the upper Jovian atmosphere if they were solely responsible for Jovian auroral processes. Model calculations of heavy ion precipitation and corresponding estimates of the associated sulfur and oxygen UV emissions previously carried out suggest emission values for 1304 A OI emission that are at least 30 times larger than the upper limit values set by the IUE observations reported. On the other hand the observed (feature of SII at 1256 A of 2 kR) is quite comparable to the theoretically predicted emission intensity. Taken together these observations and calculations suggest that electron as well as ion precipitation play a role in Jovian auroral processes. In light of earlier X-ray observations and in-situ plasma observations that suggest energetic heavy ion precipitation in the Jovian auroral zone, a scenario is suggested where heavy ion auroral energy deposition is concentrated at altitudes below the <b>homopause.</b> Electrons with energies of 10 to 30 keV are responsible for the bulk of the observable UV and EUV emissions since they deposit their energy above the methane absorbing layer defined by the <b>homopause...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ionization in {{planetary}} atmospheres can {{be produced}} by solar photoionization, photoelectron impact ionization, and, in auroral regions, by impact of precipitating particles. This ionization is lost mainly in dissociative recombination (DR) of molecular ions. Although atomic ions cannot undergo DR, they can be transformed locally through ion-molecule reactions into molecular ions, {{or they may be}} transported vertically or horizontally to regions of the atmosphere where such transformations are possible. Because DR reactions tend to be very exothermic, they can be an important source of kinetically or internally excited fragments. In interplanetary thermospheres, the neutral densities decrease exponentially with altitude. Below the <b>homopause</b> (or turbopause), the atmosphere is assumed to be thoroughly mixed by convection and/or turbulence. Above the <b>homopause,</b> diffusion is the major transport mechanism, and each species is distributed according to its mass, with the logarithmic derivative of the density with respect to altitude given approximately by - 1 /H, where H = kT/mg is the scale height. In this expression, T is the neutral temperature, g is the local acceleration of gravity, and m is the mass of the species. Thus lighter species become relatively more abundant, and heavier species less abundant, as the altitude increases. This variation of the neutral composition can lead to changes in the ion composition; furthermore, as the neutral densities decrease, dissociative recombination becomes more important relative to ion-neutral reactions as a loss mechanism for molecular ions...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was used to}} study methane photochemistry in the stratosphere of Neptune. The observed mixing ratio of methane, 2 %, forces photolysis to occur near the CH 4 <b>homopause.</b> For an assumed nominal value of the eddy mixing coefficient of 106 cm 2 sec- 1 at the CH 4 <b>homopause,</b> the predicted average mixing ratios of C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 2, 1. 5 x 10 - 6 and 6 x 10 - 7, respectively, agree well with observations in the infrared. The acetylene and ethane abundances are weakly dependent upon {{the strength of the}} eddy mixing and directly proportional to it. Haze production from methane photochemistry results from the formation of hydrocarbon ices and polyacetylenes. The calculated mixing ratios of C 2 H 6, C 2 H 2 are large enough to cause condensation to their respective ices near the tropopause. These hazes are capable of providing the necessary aerosol optical depth at the appropriate pressure levels required by observations of Neptune in the visible and near IR. Polyacetylene formation from C 2 H 2 photolysis is limited by the low quantum yield of dissociation for acetylene, efficient recycling of its photolysis products by the other hydrocarbons, and the greatly reduced solar flux at Neptune. Comparisons of model predictions to Uranus show both a lower ratio of polyacetylene production to hydrocarbon ice and a lower likelihood of UV postprocessing of the acetylene ice to polymers on Neptune compared to Uranus. This is in agreement with the observed difference in the single scattering albedo of the stratospheric aerosols in the visible between Uranus and Neptune, with the aerosols on Neptune being brighter...|$|E

Images have been analyzed to determine the altitude of the emission above the limb and infer the characteristic energy of the auroral electrons. Our study shows that the peak of the emission is located 1000 - 1300 km above the limb, indicating that the precipitated electrons are mostly in the 0. 1 - 1 keV energy range, that is significantly less than on Jupiter. Another source of information on the electron energy are the FUV spectra obtained with Voyager UVS (Sandel et al., 1982) and the HST-STIS (Gérard et al., 2004) and Cassini-UVIS spectrographs which only occasionally show a signature of absorption by hydrocarbons. Consequently, the emission is located above but close to the methane <b>homopause.</b> Finally, EUV spectra collected with the FUSE satellite (Gustin et al., 2008) provide information on the H 2 column overlying the aurora through analysis of self-absorption and rotational temperature of the emitting layer from the intensity distribution among the H 2 lines.

Our {{goal is to}} study in detail the distributions and fluxes of atomic and molecular hydrogen in the model, while identifying sources of qualitative and quantitative uncertainties. Our study confirms that the escape of atomic and molecular hydrogen to space {{is limited by the}} diffusion through the <b>homopause</b> level. The H distribution and flux inside the atmosphere are very sensitive to the eddy diffusion coefficient used above altitude 600 km. We chose a high value of this coefficient 1 108 cm 2 s 1 and a <b>homopause</b> level around altitude 900 km. We find that H flows down significantly from the production region above 500 km to the region [300 – 500] km, where it recombines into H 2. Production of both H and H 2 also occurs in the stratosphere, mostly from photodissociation of acetylene. The only available observational data to be compared are the escape rate of H deduced from Pioneer 11 and IUE observations of the H torus 1 – 3 109 cm 2 s 1 and the latest retrieved value of the H 2 mole fraction in the stratosphere: (1. 1 0. 1) 103. Our results for both of these values are at least 50 – 100 % higher, though the uncertainties within the chemical schemes and other aspects of the model are large. The chemical conversion from H to H 2 is essentially done through catalytic cycles using acetylene and diacetylene. We have studied the role of this diacetylene cycle, for which the associated reaction rates are poorly known. We find that it mostly affects C 4 species and benzene in the lower atmosphere, rather than the H profile and the hydrogen budget. We have introduced the heterogenous recombination of hydrogen on the surface of aerosol particles in the stratosphere, and this appears to be a significant process, comparable to the chemical processes.

At the tropopause, C 2 H 6 is the major photochemical species and C 2 H 2, C 3 H 8, and C 4 H 10 are of comparable abundance and down from C 2 H 6 {{by a factor of}} ten. These species may be detectable with the mass spectrometer of the Galileo Probe. The vertical distributions of the photochemical species are sensitive to the magnitude of eddy diffusive mixing in the troposphere and stratosphere and the details of the interface region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wereport {{the first}} {{detection}} ofmethyl radicals (CH 3) {{in the upper}} atmosphere of Saturn. Emission from the ν 2 Q– branch of CH 3 at 16. 50 µm was detected from observations with the Short–Wavelength Spectrometer of the ISO satellite. A CH 3 column density in the range 1. 5 – 7. 51013 molec cm− 2 is derived, taking into account uncertainties in the data cali-bration, CH 3 band strength, and atmospheric model. Results are compared with predictions of photochemical models. The CH 3 abundance is mostly sensitive to the poorly known methyl recombination rates and to the eddy mixing profile. The ISO observations imply either CH 3 recombination rates larger than used in current photochemical models, or an eddy mixing coef-ficient near the methane <b>homopause</b> smaller than inferred from Voyager ultraviolet measurements.
