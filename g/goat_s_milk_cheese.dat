40|$|In {{a couple}} of years, your herd of goats could be able to supply the entire {{population}} of Africa with a vaccine against malaria. Numerous research efforts around the world, all seeking the remedy against malaria, are on the brink of breakthroughs. However, few seem promising in terms of availability and affordability for the millions of people exposed to the parasite (see Spore 97, main article). A researcher at the US-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Anthony Stowers, is one of many to take up the challenge of developing a medicine which is cheap to manufacture, for use in countries hardest hit. NIAID teamed up with the Genzyme Transgenics Corporation and produced two transgenic mouse strains that carry a form of the gene of a surface protein from the lethal malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The cells in the mammary glands switch on the transgenes, releasing the vaccine protein in the animal <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> Since mice produce very little milk, a similar test was carried out on goats. With reasonable success. In January 2002, NIAID announced that the vaccine in <b>goat</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> worked for four out of five vaccinated monkeys, whereas six out of seven unvaccinated monkeys died of malaria. The laboratory will start clinical tests with humans in 2003.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate milk yield and eating behaviour of crossbred goats, German Improved Fawn × Hair crossbred (GIF) and Saanen × Hair <b>goats</b> (<b>S),</b> in subtropical eastern Mediterranean climate of Turkey during early summer season. Eight GIF and eight <b>S</b> <b>goats</b> were individually housed in 1. 5 × 1. 5 m pens. Diurnal eating patterns were monitored by a system that recorded meal size and meal length. Milk yield (kg/day) was 1. 77 in GIF and 2. 0 in <b>S</b> <b>goats,</b> whereas <b>milk</b> production efficiency (kg feed/kg milk) was 1. 15 in GIF and 1. 07 in <b>S</b> <b>goats.</b> The differences between GIF and <b>S</b> <b>goats</b> in eating behaviour parameters were significant: the <b>S</b> <b>goats</b> had higher meal size and meal length and longer inter-meal interval, meal time, and eating rate within in each meal, but lower number of meals in comparison with GIF goats.
