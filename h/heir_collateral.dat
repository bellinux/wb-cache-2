50|$|As {{in nearly}} all Hindu states, {{succession}} follows the salic law, is vested in the Bhosle dynasty, follows male primogeniture, and permits the ruler to adopt an <b>heir</b> from <b>collateral</b> branches of the Bhosle dynasty in case {{of the failure of}} the direct line.|$|R
50|$|Art. 37. If the King has no male descendants, {{he shall}} {{designate}} his <b>heir</b> from the <b>collateral</b> line. If the King has not {{prior to his}} death designated his heir, Parliament shall in joint session elect a King from the same dynasty.|$|R
50|$|The 1838 {{constitution}} was replaced in 1842 by reviving the 1826 Constitutional Charter of Portugal. Among other things, the 1826 charter stipulated that, {{should there be}} no eligible descendants of Maria II of Portugal, the crown would pass to a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Duchy of Parma and Piacenza {{continued}} to be ruled by the Farnese until the 17th century. But the city of Castro {{was removed from the}} Farnese family holdings when the Farnese fell out with the Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII sparking the Wars of Castro. In 1649, the conflict ended when Pope Innocent X had the city razed. The small dukedom eventually fell under the Spanish control and influence; the family lost Parma and Piacenza in 1731 when the last duke, Antonio Farnese, died without direct <b>heirs</b> and his <b>collateral</b> <b>heir,</b> his niece Elizabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain, passed a successful claim on to her sons, Don Carlos (later King Carlos III of Spain) and Filippo House of Bourbon-Parma.|$|R
50|$|When {{the direct}} {{line of the}} Campbells of Craignish ended in 1544, the {{rightful}} <b>heir,</b> a <b>collateral</b> relative {{by the name of}} Charles Tearlach Mor Campbell of Corranmore in Craignish had the misfortune to kill Gillies of Glenmore in a brawl. This compelled him to flee to Perthshire where he settled at Lochtayside under the protection of the Breadalbane family. This unfortunate event therefore prevented Charles from claiming the estate, and so it fell {{into the hands of the}} Earls (later Dukes) of Argyll.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, {{membership}} {{rules have}} continued as first established. They provide for approving {{the application of}} a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> if the direct male line dies out. Membership has been expanded in some state societies to include descendants of those who died during the war, but it remains limited.|$|R
50|$|Kilravock Castle {{has been}} {{continuously}} tenanted by the Roses, {{a family of}} Norman origin, who arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror. They settled at Kilravock in 1293, since which date son has succeeded father without the interposition of a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir,</b> an instance of direct descent unique in Scottish history.|$|R
50|$|The Mackenzie Baronetcy, of Scatwell in the County of Ross, {{was created}} in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 22 February 1703 for Kenneth Mackenzie, who {{represented}} Ross-shire in the Scottish Parliament. He was a descendant of Kenneth Mackenzie, brother of the first Baronet of the 1628 creation. The fifth Baronet represented Ross-shire in the British Parliament and was Lord Lieutenant of Ross-shire. The presumed tenth and eleventh Baronets never successfully proved their succession and neither has the presumed twelfth and present Baronet, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1972. The Mackenzie baronets of Tarbat is a collateral branch of the Mackenzie Earls of Cromarty and the present Baronet claims he is the representative as <b>heir</b> male <b>collateral</b> of Sir John Mackenzie, 1st Baronet, of Tarbat (see above).|$|R
50|$|Until 2002, {{a treaty}} between Monaco and France stated {{that if the}} reigning Prince ever failed to leave dynastic offspring, then {{sovereignty}} over the Grimaldi realm would revert to France. The 2002 agreement modified this to expand the pool of potential <b>heirs</b> to dynastic <b>collaterals</b> of the reigning Prince (excluding adoptive heirs, hitherto allowed, e.g. Princess Charlotte and her descendants), guaranteeing Monegasque independence. Article I of Monaco's house law requires that the reigning Prince or Princess bear the surname of Grimaldi.|$|R
5000|$|Thus {{property}} settled upon {{someone and}} the heirs of their body—whether male, female, or generally—will pass to children, grandchildren and so on, {{but not to}} nephews of the grantee, his or her sisters, uncles and their descendants. Nor will a limitation in a grant to someone's [...] "heirs" [...] carry the property to <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs</b> in England, since the law presumes that [...] "heirs of the body" [...] are meant though a grant to the grantee and his heirs male will.|$|R
50|$|The title Earl of Stirling became dormant or expired {{upon the}} death of Henry Alexander, the 5th Earl of Stirling. William's father, James Alexander, who had fled from Scotland in 1716 after {{participating}} in the Jacobite rising, did not seek the title. Upon his death William lay claim to the title and filed suit. His relationship to the 5th Earl was not through heirs of the body, but through <b>heir</b> male <b>collateral</b> and the inheritance by Proximity of blood had been questioned. It was settled in his favor, by a unanimous vote of a jury of twelve in a Scottish court in 1759, and William claimed the disputed title of Earl of Stirling. It is not clear if the case went to court because of an unfavorable answer from the Lord Lyon King of Arms concerning the peerage.|$|R
50|$|Succession by {{this special}} {{remainder}} {{was first to}} occur {{on the death of}} the fourth Earl in 1702, when the line of the first Earl became extinct. The Earldom was therefore able to pass through collateral succession to Sir Robert Dalzell, 3rd Baronet, the senior heir of the first Lord and a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> of the first Earl being the great-grandson of the first Earl's brother. But for this special remainder, he would have inherited only the Lordship, and the Earldom would have then become extinct.|$|R
5000|$|In 1869, the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords, after {{a series}} of {{hearings}} beginning in 1862 under the title of Wiltes Claim of Peerage 4 HL 126, rejected the claim of Simon Thomas Scrope, of Danby, to the Earldom of Wiltes (Wiltshire) granted to William le Scrope, above. It was proved that Simon Thomas Scrope was the senior heir male of the Earl of Wiltes, but the Committee for Privileges decided that {{as a matter of law}} an English peerage could not descend to heirs male general who were not directly descended from the original grantee; they also rejected arguments based on the irregularity of the original sentence by Henry IV before he had become King. The Committee declined to follow its own earlier decision in the Devon Peerage Claim (1831) 5 English Reports 293, in which a grant to [...] "heirs male" [...] had been allowed to pass to <b>heirs</b> male <b>collateral.</b>|$|R
50|$|Five states (Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee) impose only {{inheritance}} taxes. The Tennessee tax {{is scheduled}} to be eliminated for deaths after December 31, 2015. The exemptions under state inheritance taxes vary greatly, ranging from $500 (Kentucky and New Jersey) for bequests to unrelated individuals to unlimited exemptions (Iowa and Kentucky) for bequests to lineal heirs, such as children or parents of the decedent. No states tax bequests to surviving spouses. Top tax rates range from 4.5 percent (Pennsylvania on lineal heirs) to 18 percent (Nebraska on <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs).</b> Tennessee’s inheritance tax is calculated more like an estate tax (i.e., the tax does not vary based on the beneficiary).|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} error {{made by the}} House of Lords in {{awarding}} a title {{was not in the}} case of a barony, but for the Scottish earldom of Mar which was awarded to a distant <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> male of a previous earl, and not to the heir general, as customary under Scottish peerage law. This 1875 Committee finding declared that a separate Scottish earldom with remainder to heirs male had been created in 1565, and in 1885 an Act of Parliament revived the ancient title for the heir general. As a result, there are two peers holding the Mar title today; the Countess of Mar (holder of the oldest surviving Scottish peerage) and the Earl of Mar and Kellie.|$|R
5000|$|Shimrod can not act {{directly}} against Carfilhiot {{to rescue}} Glyneth and Dhrun, {{because that would}} constitute taking Aillas' side in a political matter and violate Murgen's edict. However, Aillas has learned that Quilcy, King of South Ulfland, has drowned in his bathtub, and that Aillas is his rightful <b>heir</b> by <b>collateral</b> lineage. He lands a force of troops in South Ulfland, proclaims his kingship, and demands a show of fealty from Carfilhiot as Carfilhiot's rightful liege lord. Carfilhiot refuses, and Aillas' Troice troops lay siege to his castle. Aillas' soldiers, informed by {{his knowledge of the}} castle's defenses, avoid the traps and pitfalls Carfilhiot has prepared, much to Carfilhiot's dismay. He calls on Tamurello, who confronts Aillas. This gives Shimrod an excuse to call on Murgen, who forbids Tamurello from acting and banishes him to his mansion. Tamurello offers to bring Carfilhiot to his manse, but Carfilhiot refuses to leave his castle. The siege is eventually successful, Dhrun and Glyneth are rescued, and Carfilhiot is hanged as a traitor to his king. When his body is cremated, a green fume escapes and blows out to sea, where it mixes with the spume and condenses into a [...] "green pearl", which sinks into the sea and is swallowed by a fish.|$|R
5000|$|While Duarte Nuno was {{accepted}} by most monarchists, there were some constitutionalists who continued to contest his claim. Duarte Nuno was undisputed as the legal heir of his grandfather, Miguel I, but there were doubts about whether he was the legal heir of the last reigning king of Portugal, Manuel II. Articles 87 and 88 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826, in force when the monarchy was overthrown, stated that the throne passed first to the descendants of Queen Maria II (from whom Duarte Nuno was not descended), and only when they were extinct to <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs.</b> [...] Maria II had living descendants in 1932, {{but none of these}} had Portuguese nationality. Article 89 of the 1826 Charter stipulated that [...] "no foreigner may succeed to the crown of the kingdom of Portugal".|$|R
60|$|This slow {{succession}} of intelligence was of some advantage to Richard Waverley {{in the case}} before us; for, had {{the sum total of}} his enormities reached the ears of Sir Everard at once, {{there can be no doubt}} that the new commissioner would have had little reason to pique himself on the success of his politics. The Baronet, although the mildest of human beings, was not without sensitive points in his character; his brother's conduct had wounded these deeply; the Waverley estate was fettered by no entail (for it had never entered into the head of any of its former possessors that one of their progeny could be guilty of the atrocities laid by Dyer's 'Letter' to the door of Richard), and if it had, the marriage of the proprietor might have been fatal to a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir.</b> These various ideas floated through the brain of Sir Everard without, however, producing any determined conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|The seventh laird {{left only}} one daughter, Christine Campbell (b. 1323). Her {{weakness}} and imprudence caused {{the majority of}} the estate to be resigned to the Knight of Lochow, who took advantage of her. She was left with {{only a small portion of}} the upper part of Craignish under his superiority. The nearest male representative - Ronald Campbell - fought hard to win back his heritage, and the then Chief of Clan Campbell was obliged to allow him possession of a considerable portion of the estate, but retaining the superiority, and inserting a condition in the grant that if there was ever no male heir in the direct line the lands were to revert automatically to the Argyll family. In 1544 the direct line ended, and the rightful <b>heir,</b> a <b>collateral</b> relative by the name of Charles Campbell of Corranmore in Craignish had the misfortune to kill Gillies of Glenmore in a brawl. This compelled him to flee to Perthshire where he settled at Lochtayside under the protection of the Breadalbane family. This unfortunate event therefore prevented Charles from claiming the estate, and so it fell into the hands of the Earls (later Dukes) of Argyll. Charles' descendants at Killin, Perthshire were later recognised by the Lord Lyon as Chieftains of the Clan Tearlach branch of Clan Campbell and from them descended the Campbells of Inverneill. A grandson of Duncan Campbell 8th of Inverneill in the 1980s owned one of the apartments at Craignish Castle. The arms of Campbell of Inverneill are those of Campbell of Craignish differenced by the addition of [...] "a bordure azure" [...] (a blue border). The first and third Campbells of Inverneill (Sir Archibald Campbell of Inverneill and Sir Janes Campbell of Inverneill Bt were interred at Westminster Abbey in what is now known as Poets' Corner. The second, Sir James Campbell of Inverneill and many succeeding Campbells of Inverneill are interred in the Campbell of Inverneill Mausoleum, though the late Dr John Lorne Campbell of Inverneill (and of Canna) is interred on the Isle of Canna where he had lived for over 50 years. The estates of Inverneill, with the exception of the Mausoleum and Inverneill Island, were sold in the 1950s. Inverneill Island remains in the ownership of the present Campbell of Inverneill.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century Babu Madho Singh, eleventh in descent from Jionarain was the rular of the estate which consisted of 101 villages. Babu Madho Singh who is remembered as the successful leader and who managed his property well died in 1823. He was succeeded by his widow, Thakurain Dariao Kunwar, a most remarkable woman, who through toil and turmoil not only bravely held her own, but added to her estates than her husband had done in his lifetime. The direct line of succession had ended with the death of Thakurain's husband, Babu Madho singh. The Next male <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> was Babu Rustam Sah, whom Thakurain disliked. Babu Rustam Sah was in the service of Maharaja Man Singh, the nazim of the day and with his help succeeded in capturing Thakurain and made her write a deed in his favour. That formidable woman, whose pride was hurt, grieved for a few months and died. Rustam Sah was given the possession of the property by the nazim. Rustam Sah came to know later that the nazim had ulterior motives in helping him. A fight would have followed and Rustam would have killed nazim, but for a pandit who advised him that the time was not propitious. Later, Rustam Sah sought asylum across the British border and was made the taluqdar of Dera, which consisted of 336 villages. Rustam Sah rendered excellent service during the Mutiny. He died in 1877 and was succeeded by his nephew, Raja Rudra Pratap Singh.|$|R
500|$|After the {{rejection}} of the Second Reform Bill by the Upper House in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called [...] "Reform Riots". In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the House of Lords, and re-introduced the Bill, which still faced difficulties in the House of Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' recalcitrance, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected—though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours. William reluctantly agreed {{to the creation of the}} number of peers sufficient [...] "to secure the success of the bill". However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage, told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs</b> of existing peers, so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety. The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the Reform Act 1832 was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.|$|R
