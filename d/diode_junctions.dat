5000|$|FETs {{are further}} divided into depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types, {{depending}} on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage.

For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can [...] "deplete" [...] the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the <b>diode</b> <b>junctions</b> would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices;most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.|$|E

The <b>diode</b> <b>junctions</b> were made by a P+ implantation at 300 °C and a post implantation annealing at 1300 °C. The diode emitter area was protected by 0. 6 µm thick CVD oxide during the processing of the MOSFET gate oxide. Three gate oxide processes were taken into account: two of them include a N implantation before a wet oxidation, while the third one was a standard oxidation. Considering the effect on the n+/p diodes, the main difference among the processes were the wet thermal oxidation time that ranged between 180 and 480 min at a temperature of 1100 °C. The diode current-voltage characteristics show similar forward but different reverse curves in the temperature range of 25 - 290 °C. Differences in reverse bias voltage {{as a function of the}} measurement temperature have been analyzed and are related to the different gate oxidation time. A correlation between the shortest oxidation time and the lower leakage current is presented...|$|E
40|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} (NWs) {{could enable}} low-cost and efficient photovoltaics, though their performance {{has been limited}} by nonideal electrical characteristics and an inability to tune absorption properties. We overcome these limitations through controlled synthesis {{of a series of}} polymorphic core/multishell NWs with highly crystalline, hexagonally-faceted shells, and well-defined coaxial (p/n) and p/intrinsic/n (p/i/n) <b>diode</b> <b>junctions.</b> Designed 200 – 300  nm diameter p/i/n NW diodes exhibit ultralow leakage currents of approximately 1  fA, and open-circuit voltages and fill-factors up to 0. 5  V and 73 %, respectively, under one-sun illumination. Single-NW wavelength-dependent photocurrent measurements reveal size-tunable optical resonances, external quantum efficiencies greater than unity, and current densities double those for silicon films of comparable thickness. In addition, finite-difference-time-domain simulations for the measured NW structures agree quantitatively with the photocurrent measurements, and demonstrate that the optical resonances are due to Fabry-Perot and whispering-gallery cavity modes supported in the high-quality faceted nanostructures. Synthetically optimized NW devices achieve current densities of 17  mA/cm 2 and power-conversion efficiencies of 6 %. Horizontal integration of multiple NWs demonstrates linear scaling of the absolute photocurrent with number of NWs, as well as retention of the high open-circuit voltages and short-circuit current densities measured for single NW devices. Notably, assembly of 2  NW elements into vertical stacks yields short-circuit current densities of 25  mA/cm 2 with a backside reflector, and simulations further show that such stacking represents an attractive approach for further enhancing performance with projected efficiencies of >  15 % for 1. 2  μm thick 5  NW stacks...|$|E

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{that a new}} pyroelectric device can be created from ferroelectrics with gradient in composition, and that the field dependence of the observed hysteresis offset is as predicted from theory. Homogeneous thin films of BaxSr 1 -xTiO 3 (x= 0. 7, 0. 8, 0. 9, and 1. 0) were prepared by metallorganic decomposition (MOD). The relative permittivity, dissipation, polarization, resistivity, and grain size were studied {{as a function of}} composition and temperature. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops were observed for all values of x and were found to be independent of measurement temperature though strongly dependent upon grain size. Ferroelectric BST thin films with compositional gradients normal to the growth surface have been formed by successive deposition and annealing of films having step-variable Ba to Sr ratios. These films, graded ferroelectric devices or GFD 2 ̆ 7 s, are the dielectric equivalent of the semiconductor p-n and n-p junctions. Unlike semiconductor <b>diode</b> <b>junctions</b> which have a built-in potential arising from the diffusion of free charge across the junction, the intrinsic potential in graded ferroelectric devices is due to a gradient in bound charge. In their simplest forms, graded ferroelectric devices give rise to a totally new, but controllable hysteresis phenomenon that is not observed in homogenous ferroelectric materials. Slater 2 ̆ 7 s empirical model for ferroelectric materials has been also extended to describe the graded ferroelectric devices. This model accounts for several aspects of these structures including: the broadness of the permittivity plots with temperature, the formation of a spontaneous potential upon oscillatory field excitation, offsets in the hysteresis graphs along the displacement axis with directions which are gradient dependent, and the electric field dependence of that offset. The graded ferroelectric devices, as formed by MOD, show very low conventional pyroelectric coefficient. However, the effective pyroelectric coefficients obtained from these active devices were much greater, reaching a maximum of 0. 06 µC/cm 2 -°C, compared to conventional value of 0. 045 µC/cm 2 -°C for homogeneous BST films. This study {{demonstrates that}} the method used to fabricate the GFD 2 ̆ 7 s is inadequate to produce the desired sensitivity. Suggestions for ways to increase the sensitivity of the GFD 2 ̆ 7 s are given...|$|E
40|$|This {{problem is}} {{motivated}} {{by the use of}} crystals as detectors of energetic charged particles that pass completely through the crystal, leaving a trail of electron-ion pairs. Although the crystals are nominally insulators, the electrons so liberated are in the conduction band and can be separated from the ion by a DC electric field, resulting in a signal pulse on the electrodes plated onto opposite faces of the crystal. 1, 2, 3 However, recombination of the drifting electrons at impurity sites is an issue, and it was eventually realized that the high purities of germanium and silicon required for successful transistors are also good for crystalline particle detectors. 4 In addition, p-n <b>diode</b> <b>junctions</b> proved to be suitable for particle detectors [10]. A typical silicon p-n junction is illustrated below, in which a potential difference ΔV ≈ 0. 8 V develops across the junction {{in the absence of an}} external bias voltage, 5 due to the layers of (space) charge, a few μm thick. The p-side of the junction is doped with a bulk number density Np (or Na) of atoms (such as boron) with 3 valence electrons (compared to 4 for Si), called acceptors in that these atoms can accept electrons from neighboring atoms, the motion of which electrons in one direction corresponds to a current of (electrically positive) holes in the other. The n-side is doped with number density Nn (or Nd) of atoms with 5 valence electrons (such as phosphorus), called donors. 6 A electron current can flow from the n-side to the p-side only if an external (forward) bias voltage Vp − Vn> ΔV is applied, and no (significant) electron current flows from the p-side to the n-side for any applied voltage less than this. The p-n junction acts as a diode/rectifier. Doped silicon has “free ” charge carriers, predominantly holes in p-doping and predominantly electrons in n-doping. As such, the can be no electric field inside the doped silicon 1 Crystals with metallic electrodes are metal-semiconductor junctions, first investigated by Braun in 1874 [1].
