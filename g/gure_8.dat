40|$|This {{paper will}} compare {{the concept of}} nature as it appears in the philosophies of the American pragmatist John Dewey and the Chinese text known as the Zhuangzi, with an aim towards mapping out a {{heuristic}} program which {{might be used to}} correct various interpretive diﬃ culties in reading each ﬁ <b>gure.</b> <b>8</b> I shall argue that Dewey and Zhuangzi both held more complex and comprehensive philosophies of nature than for which either is typically credited. Such a view of nature turns on the notion of continuity, particularly that between an experiencing organism [Dewey’s “live creature”] and the conditioning environment [Zhuangzi’s “crooked tree”]. Where Dewey’s and Zhuangzi’s ideas about nature converge, one ﬁ nds similarities in prescriptions made for human action, and in the few places where they diﬀ er, one ﬁ nds mutually complementary insights. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

We {{prove that}} a polygon {{generating}} a tessellation {{of the plane}} when reected in its edges is either a regular hexagon; a 60 - 90 - 120 kite; a 120 -rhombus; a rectangle; an equilateral, a 30 -right, an isosceles right, or a 120 -isosceles triangle. Of these, the four whose interior angles measure at most 90 solve the Stamp Folding Problem. How many ways can one con <b>8</b> ̆ 5 <b>gure</b> the perforation lines {{on a sheet of}} postage stamps so that it folds conveniently into a stack of single stamps? The solution of this Stamp Folding Problemfollows from our main result, which was discovered by Millersville University students Andrew Hall, Joshua York, and the 8 ̆ 5 rst author during an undergraduate research seminar directed by the second author in the spring of 2009 : Theorem 1. A polygon that generates a tessellation of the plane when reected in its edges is either a regular hexagon; a 60 - 90 - 120 kite; a 120 -rhombus; a rectangle; an equilateral, a 30 -right, an isosceles right, or a 120 -isosceles triangle. A tessellation (or tiling) of the plane is a collection of plane <b>8</b> ̆ 5 <b>gures</b> that <b>8</b> ̆ 5 lls the plane with no overlaps and no gaps. An edge tessellation is generated by reecting a polygon in its edges. Edge tessellations are the most symmetric examples of Laves tilings, as one can see from the complete list in [3]. The name Laves tilinghonors the German crystallographer Fritz Laves (1906 - 1978). Corollary 1. A polygon generating an edge tessellation that solves the Stamp Fold-ing Problem is either a rectangle; an equilateral, a 30 -right, or an isosceles right triangle. Figure 1.
