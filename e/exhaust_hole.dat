5000|$|The body {{comprises}} 11 sections/panels, {{the centre}} tub section, nose cone, bonnet, front side panels, rear section, boot lid and all four wings. The centre section is reinforced with a steel cage {{for safety and}} rigidity. There is also a roll-over hoop welded into the section which is hidden under the head rest. This section attaches to the chassis by mounting point {{at the rear of}} the cage and also at the front in the footwells. The cage also holds the seat belt mounting points. The nose cone houses the grill and is in the style of 50s and 60s racing cars. The side panels can have either nothing, 3 mesh covered holes or a large <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole</b> at the top. An S6 models would usually have 3 mesh covered holes on the intake side and a large <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole</b> on the other side. A V12 model would usually have the three mesh holes on both sides and also an <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole</b> just underneath that. Some owners have opted for mixed options, mainly because of different exhaust systems. Most earlier models also had louvers near the bottom of each side panel. The side repeaters are also positioned on the side panels. The bonnet has a large, central scoop and, on most S6 models, a bump above where the intake sits as the carburetors need clearance and would contact the bonnet otherwise. The rear section consists of the head fairing, and fuel filler cap. On later cars (Mk.II specifically), there is also a boot in the rear section. The wings are fixed to the chassis and are positioned above each wheel. The front wings have the front indicators on. The rear wings have the rear lights, brake lights, indicators and reflectors. The number plate is mounted on the right rear wing. Body panels are made out of aluminium, carbon fibre or typically fibreglass (GRP) ...|$|E

We studied exhaled air and particle dispersion through an oronasal mask attached to a human-patient simulator (HPS) during noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV). Methods: Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Therapy with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was started at 10 cm H 2 O and gradually increased to 18 cm H 2 O, whereas expiratory positive airway pressure was maintained at 4 cm H 2 O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Findings: A jet plume of air leaked through the mask <b>exhaust</b> <b>holes</b> to a radial distance of 0. 25 m from the mask during the application of IPAP at 10 cm H 2 O with some leakage from the nasal bridge.

40|$|The Scale Model Acoustic Test (SMAT) is a 5 % scale {{test of the}} Space Launch System (SLS), {{which is}} {{currently}} being designed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The purpose of this test is to characterize and understand a variety of acoustic phenomena that occur during the early portions of lift off, one being the overpressure environment that develops shortly after booster ignition. The pressure waves that propagate from the mobile launcher (ML) <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole</b> are defined as the ignition overpressure (IOP), while {{the portion of the}} pressure waves that exit the duct or trench are the duct overpressure (DOP). Distinguishing the IOP and DOP in scale model test data has been difficult in past experiences and in early SMAT results, due to the effects of scaling the geometry. The speed of sound of the air and combustion gas constituents is not scaled, and therefore the SMAT pressure waves propagate at approximately the same speed as occurs in full scale. However, the SMAT geometry is twenty times smaller, allowing the pressure waves to move down the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole,</b> through the trench and duct, and impact the vehicle model much faster than occurs at full scale. The DOP waves impact portions of the vehicle {{at the same time as}} the IOP waves, making it difficult to distinguish the different waves and fully understand the data. To better understand the SMAT data, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed with a fictitious geometry that isolates the IOP and DOP. The upper and lower portions of the domain were segregated to accomplish the isolation in such a way that the flow physics were not significantly altered. The Loci/CHEM CFD software program was used to perform this analysis...|$|E
40|$|The first NASA Space Shuttle flight (STS- 1) {{produced}} an overpressure wave that exceeded preflight predictions {{by as much}} as 5 to 1. This second overpressure wave occurred just after the solid rocket booster (SRB) igniter wave. To understand this overpressure phenomenon, a numerical simulation effort was undertaken. Both the SRB static firing test and STS- 1 geometries were studied for two-dimensional, inviscid and viscous flow. The inviscid calculations did not produce significant second overpressure waves. However, the viscous calculations did produce second overpressure waves that qualitatively agree with experiment. These overpressure waves were present in both the static firing test and STS- 1 geometries. This second overpressure wave is generated by the motion of the boundary layer separation point and the subsequent radial motion of the exhaust jet during the start-up of the SRB nozzle flow. The presence of the mobile launch platform <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole</b> wale amplifies this wave, but {{does not appear to be}} the source of any additional overpressure waves. The lack of good quantitative agreement between theory and experiment indicates that other overpressure sources, not accounted for by this simulation, may be present...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-measure}} borehole {{technique has}} been shown by the Bureau of Mines {{to be an effective}} method of controlling methane liberated by fracturing the roof strata in longwall gobs where overburden is less than 750 ft (229 m). Boreholes are drilled into roof strata before mining operations affect the roof strata. Longwall mining fractures the roof strata and releases methane from source beds. Surface exhausters or vacuum pumps are used to draw the gas to the surface through an underground pipeline and vertical <b>exhaust</b> <b>hole.</b> The captured methane is thus prevented from entering the mine's ventilation system. About 71 pct of the methane produced by longwall mining in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed was captured by the cross-measure boreholes. Borehole spacing is an important factor affecting the performance of the technique. Interference tests and measurements of methane flows in return air indicate borehole spacing in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed should be limited to about 200 ft (61 m) except on the first 600 ft (183 m) of the longwall, where spacing should be reduced to about 100 ft (30 m) to capture the large quantities of methane released when the first large roof fall occurs. Comparisons between measured and calculated gas pressure differentials on boreholes indicate borehole length can be reduced from 280 to 140 ft (85 to 43 m), which reduces drilling costs significantly. Additional experimentation is necessary to verify the calculations...|$|E

However, this solar dryer has not been tested with the real simplisia, so that performance as well as technical problem unknown yet. In addition, this solar dryer has a weakness in lacking of drying flow parameter control. This problem can be solved to use a variable inlet and exhaust.

40|$|Kennedy Space Center is {{not only}} {{home to one of}} the largest {{buildings}} in the world - the massive Vehicle Assembly Building - it also hosts a number of one-of-a-kind facilities. The more than 30 -mile-long campus has witnessed every launch from the Space Shuttle Launch Pad, as well as many homecomings at the Shuttle Landing Facility. Just as important, the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) has seen each element of the International Space Station (ISS) that passes through Kennedy before it goes into orbit. The SSPF is where ISS components are checked, tested, and adjusted before being packed into the Space Shuttle for transport. In an environment like the SSPF - spanning 457, 000 square feet of processing areas, operational control rooms, laboratories, logistics areas, and office space - large workstands and equipment used to support the processing of ISS components need to be moved around the facility. One of the devices employed for this task is an air pallet. An air pallet moves on cushions of air instead of wheels. Compressed air inflates the cushions underneath the pallet and is then expelled through <b>exhaust</b> <b>holes.</b> This forms a thin film of air between the cushions and the floor, lifting the platform off the floor and making it easy to move the heavy workstands, equipment, and ISS components. Concerned with the safety of the connections on the pressurized air hoses used for the air pallets, engineers at Kennedy modified an existing commercial cam and groove fitting to control the air supply hose {{in the event of an}} accidental release of a pressurized hose. This modification prevented the hose from detaching and, propelled by compressed air, striking workers or equipment. "At the time, these were not available on commercial coupling halves, so NASA made a modification and then put them into use.

On the other hand, recently many of yarn companies do not consider that factor as important and that can cause several problems. 	This research is conducted at a yarn company named PT Kusumaputra Santosa located at Jl. Raya Jaten Km 9, Karanganyar. The air around ring frame machine is dusty and that causes the surfaces of yarn produced by this machine defected (not aligned). The defect product must be cut at the finishing work center; this prolongs production processes, creating a bottleneck at this work center. Finally the main problem is that the real production does not reach the production target (late of production) that causes profit loss. The root problem is the dust cleaner machine cannot absorb dust optimally, because lack of <b>hole</b> at <b>exhaust</b> arm. 	Based on those problems, this research tries to propose a design improvement of dust cleaner machine by adding 10 <b>exhaust</b> <b>holes</b> at <b>exhaust</b> arm, to maximize the ability of absorbing dust in the air, in order to help PT. Kusumaputra Santosa clean the air condition in the spinning work center. The research employs Rational Method developed by Cross, 1994, to appropriate the design of dust cleaner machine. The research also employs Gravimetric Method to measure the level of dust in the air. There are literature reviews about the product design and improvement methods to help make a good design. 	Finally, with the design improvement, the dust cleaner machine can reduce the dust level in the air from 0. 91 mg/m 3 to 0. 52 mg/m 3, so there will be decreasing the defect product, reduce the number cut and join done by winding machine from 10. 3 /spindle to 7. 8 /spindle, fast production process, no bottleneck, so that the production rate is increase from 0. 38 bale/day to 0. 447 bale/day for yarn type 32 CD, and then increase from 0. 25 bale/day to 0. 3 bale/day for yarn type 30 CD...|$|R

40|$|The ECMI {{model of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation from electron holes {{is shown to}} be applicable to spontaneous magnetic reconnection. We apply it to reconnection in strong current-aligned magnetic guide fields. Such guide fields participate only passively in reconnection, which occurs in the antiparallel components to {{both sides of the}} guide-field-aligned current sheets with current carried by kinetic Alfvén waves. Reconnection generates long (the order of hundreds of electron inertial scales) electron exhaust regions at the reconnection site X point, which are extended perpendicular to the current and the guide fields. Exhausts contain a strongly density-depleted hot electron component and have properties similar to electron <b>holes.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> electron momentum space distributions are highly deformed, exhibiting steep gradients transverse to both the reconnecting and guide fields. Such properties suggest application of the ECMI mechanism with the fundamental ECMI X-mode emission beneath the nonrelativistic guide field cyclotron frequency in localized source regions. An outline of the mechanism and its prospects is given. Potential applications are the kilometric radiation (AKR) in auroral physics, solar radio emissions during flares, planetary emissions and astrophysical scenarios (radiation from stars and compact objects) involving the presence of strong magnetic fields and field-aligned currents. Drift of the exhausts along the guide field maps the local field and plasma properties. Escape of radiation from the exhaust and radiation source region still poses a problem. The mechanism can be studied in 2 -D particle simulations of strong guide field reconnection which favours 2 -D, mapping the deformation of the electron distribution perpendicular to the guide field, and using it in the numerical calculation of the ECMI growth rate. The mechanism suggests also that reconnection in general may become a source of the ECMI with or without guide fields. This is of particular interest in extended turbulent plasmas where reconnection serves as an integral dissipation mechanism of turbulent energy in myriads of small-scale current filaments...|$|R
40|$|NTP {{development}} is currently {{supported by the}} NASA program office "Advanced Exploration Systems". The concept is a main propulsion option being considered for human missions to Mars in the 2030 's. Major NTP development {{took place in the}} 1960 's and 1970 's under the Rover/NERVA program. The technology had matured to TRL 6 and was preparing to go to TRL 7 with a prototype flight engine before the program was cancelled. Over the last 40 years, a variety of continuations started, but only lasted a few years each. The Rover/NERVA infrastructure is almost all gone. The only remains are a few pieces of hardware, final reports and a few who worked the Rover/NERVA. Two types of nuclear fuel are being investigated to meet the current engine design specific impulse of 900 seconds compared to approximately 850 seconds demonstrated during Rover/NERVA. One is a continuation of composite fuel with new coatings to better control mid-band corrosion. The other type is a CERMET fuel made of Tungsten and UO 2. Both fuels are being made from Rover/NERVA lessons learned, but with slightly different recipes to increase fuel endurance at higher operating temperatures. The technology readiness level (TRL) of these current modified reactor fuels is approximately TRL 3. To keep the development cost low and help mature the TRL level past 4 quickly, a few special non-nuclear test facilities have been made to test surrogate fuel, with depleted uranium, as coupons and full length elements. Both facilities utilize inductive heating and are licensed to handle depleted uranium. TRL 5 requires exposing the fuel to a nuclear environment and TRL 6 requires a prototype ground or flight engine system test. Currently, three different NTP ground test facility options are being investigated: <b>exhaust</b> scrubber, bore <b>hole,</b> and total <b>exhaust</b> containment. In parallel, a prototype flight demonstration test is also being studied. The first human mission to Mars in the 2030 's is currently 2033.
