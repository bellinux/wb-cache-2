5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an <b>informational</b> <b>society.</b> One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Once {{with the}} Romania {{adhering}} at the European Union the public accounting system was transformed and adapted {{according to the}} requirements imposed by the international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS). This fact had imposed the appearance of legislative norms and provisions adapted to the actual requirements, by taking into account the growing and complex level of economic activities where the irreversible process of globalization takes place. The changes due to the economic politics, especially the new configuration of the international economic relations, relations characterized by an intense and irreversible process of globalization, have conducted to the implementation of a unitary and uniform legislation, particularly for the member states of EU. The accounting reform has begun through the harmonization of legislation {{according to the requirements}} and provisions of International Accounting Standards and European Directives.  The ampleness and the rapid rhythm of <b>informational</b> <b>society’s</b> development have implicitly leaded to the development of accounting information’s importance and dimension. The decisive role of the accounting information had conducted to the accentuated growth of the interest, manifested at all <b>informational</b> <b>society’s</b> level, from the development of activities in financial and economical domain point of view. The accounting normalization process imposed the development of norms and provisions necessary to the drawing up of accounting documents, by defying methods and a specialized terminology, applied in the activity of entities and accounting specialists...|$|R

It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Surveillance {{has become}} a routine, {{everyday}} occurrence in <b>informational</b> <b>societies.</b> Many agencies {{have an interest in}} personal data, and a wide spectrum of them use searchable databases to classify and catalogue such data. From policing to welfare to the Internet and e-commerce, personal data have become very valuable, economically and administratively. While questions of privacy are indeed raised by such surveillance, the processes described here have {{as much to do with}} social sorting, and thus present new problems of automated categorization of data subjects. Privacy and data protection measures do address some of the questions raised, but they tend to be limited to individualistic readings of the situation, and not to consider issues of fairness and equality. An ethics for everyday surveillance is proposed that considers personhood as central, but highlights its social and embodied dimensions. Reductionism of practice and of analysis is thus avoided as the face comes to the fore. Hence the title. “Like Cain I now behold the chain of events that I must break [...] . ” Bob Dylan, “Every Grain of Sand” Mainly for mundane reasons, all who live in techno-logically advanced societies today find their everyday lives under scrutiny by many agencies, as never before...|$|R

When there are <b>informational</b> cascades, <b>society</b> may reap only a modest fraction of the potential gains from aggregating the diverse information of many individuals. As a result, information cascades can help explain some otherwise puzzling aspects of human and animal behavior. For example, why do individuals tend to converge on similar behavior? Why is mass behavior prone to error and fads? We suggest that the theory of observational learning, and particularly of information cascades, has much to offer economics and other social sciences. ...|$|R

Thus many industrial cities are built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or <b>informational</b> <b>society</b> is global information technology.|$|E
50|$|The Information Age is {{an account}} of the role of {{information}} in contemporary society. Manuel Castells describes the shift from an industrial society to an <b>informational</b> <b>society,</b> which started in the 1970s.

Castells emphasises the interrelationship of social, economic and political features of society, and argues that the 'network' is the defining feature that marks our current epoch.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>informational</b> network <b>societies</b> and globalisation have posed new challenges to regional development and its evaluation.

Even the actors of everyday-life, women, the young and elderly people, have began to construct networks, not of competitiveness but those of social cohesion. Both types of networks share an involvement in the new knowledge or learning economy as well as the application of management tools that enable the monitoring and self-evaluation of the intended progress. The latter also serves as a tool for capacity building of and voice for the participants. The aim of the article is to discuss some concepts and methodology of a type of assessment called network evaluation from the everyday life perspective. It is based on personal experience wit...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} classification processes {{as an element}} of surveillance {{in the context of}} the growing relevance of (online) markets in information and the blurring line between production and consumption in current <b>informational</b> capitalist <b>societies.</b> Using the example of social media, I argue that classification does not only appear as feature of the demand and supply side of information markets but is also an aspect of informational production. In doing so, the paper discusses insights from critical surveillance and advertising studies and relates it to important strands of class theory in order to learn about the social mechanism that establishes inequality between Internet service owners and users. The paper argues that a (revised) notion of exploitation and antagonistic social relations should not be omitted from theorizing the information economy. Exploitation establishes an antagonism between all Internet users and the owners of the means of communication, surveillance, and classification...|$|R
50|$|The Internet—the newest in {{a series}} of major {{information}} breakthroughs—is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for research, for example, in using online questionnaires instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The sociology of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of online communities (e.g. as found in newsgroups), virtual communities and virtual worlds, organizational change catalyzed through new media such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from industrial to <b>informational</b> <b>society</b> (or to information society). Online communities can be studied statistically through network analysis {{and at the same time}} interpreted qualitatively, such as through virtual ethnography.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the concept of the network society gained {{importance}} in information society theory. For Manuel Castells, network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). [...] "One of the key features of <b>informational</b> <b>society</b> is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" [...] (Castells 2000: 21). [...] "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" [...] (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis of}} Laura Remmel Wikileaks: Law-breaker or Justice-maker in the World of Political Communication, {{supervised}} by Professor Marju Lauristin at Tartu University. The {{purpose of the}} thesis was to clarify the phenomena {{and the impact of}} Wikileaks in the international political communication. Wikileaks is a nonprofit media organization and a relay in the global movement impacting political reality, politicians and their image in the political communication. Relying on Erving Goffman, Joshua Meyrowitz, Manuel Castells, Paolo Mancini, Yochai Benkler, Christian Fuchs, and others, the author argues that the globalizing <b>informational</b> network <b>society</b> is challenging political communication, especially concerning politicians' image-making. First part of the work concludes {{that there is a need}} for integration and integrity developing more trustworthy and transparent political communication in the contemporary world. Second part of the work describes the purpose and certain questions and material of the research as well as the method of qualitative content analysis used in the work, and the hypothesis that Wikileaks is going to become a new means in the contemporary political communication in order to make the world more just and transparent as well as the politicians and people in power to integrate with integrity. Third part of the research studies hundreds of articles concerning Wikileaks and published by the largest Estonian newspaper Postimees online version in 2010 and 2011. It appears that there are four types of attitudes toward Wikileaks and its possible impact on the global political communication. Both extremely and critically positive attitudes view Wikileaks usually as a generator of new opportunities for shaping the development of contemporary political communication. Extremely or critically negative attitudes mostly point out some threats coming along with the world of politics and political communication after Wikileaks. Fourth part of the work presents the results of expert interviews made with Estonian specialists in politics, diplomacy, political communication, PR and journalism. It appears that all except the professional politicians and diplomats affirm that Wikileaks may really become a new means in the contemporary political communication in order to make the world more just and transparent as well as the politicians and people in power to integrate with integrity. The last, fifth part of the research sums up the conclusions drawn from the newspaper articles' and expert interviews' qualitative content analysis supporting the hypothesis of the current research. In the very last chapter the author is discussing the results of her study in the perspective of researchers like Castells, Goffman, Meyrowitz, Mancini, Benkler, Fuchs, and others. She concludes that in the global <b>informational</b> network <b>society</b> Wikileaks is challenging both the current political communication practices and a growing need for politicians' integrity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- One of {{the factors}} driving the {{technological}} revolution in wireless communications and Internet access is the unbridled global demand for voice, video, and data services. Changes from an industrial to an <b>informational</b> based <b>society</b> and the associated demand for enhanced communications services push the need for seamless access further. Currently, the domestic telecom service market is divided between fixed-line and mobile providers. As such, not only networks, but also operators and services are evidently divided into two markets. To {{meet the challenges of}} fixed-mobile convergence (FMC), carriers will have to radically rethink their approaches to new products and services development. They will need to create a varied portfolio of products and services and the ability to bring these to markets in weeks rather than months to gain competitive advantages. This study discusses the opportunities to exploit in Asia Pacific region in respect to FMC services deployment. It also addresses challenges faced by the key players in Asia Pacific region. In short, it is aimed to provide an extensive study on the opportunities and challenges {{that could be used to}} derive architecture for key players in the industry to outline suitable approaches to encourage mass market diffusion of FMC services in Asia Pacific.

However, because of limited resources and access, directors have been unable to depict disturbing phenomena affecting the Roma such as forced adoptions and their exposure to health hazards.

The symbolic forms examined here are those integrally involved in the production and reproduction of educational knowledge, that is, the curriculum, pedagogy, and educational research for policy. In each of the chapters of the thesis a debate is staged between the former and the latter position, and each chapter attempts to show that the former position, {{in order to make the}} argument, collapses certain distinctions which I argue are not only essential to make, but more importantly, whose collapse will have unfortunate and sometimes pernicious effects especially for learners of the working class. This thesis is thus a series of explorations into the need for certain distinctions, into the nature of symbolic distinction; that is, into the nature and need of the boundary...|$|R
