25|$|Their {{first major}} {{engagement}} was the following year, 1854, {{in support of}} British soldiers during the events leading up to, and confrontation at, the Eureka Stockade where some miners (mostly Irish), police and soldiers were killed. From a report at the time: 'the troops and Police were under arms, and just at the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of dawn they marched upon the camp at Eureka'. Following the brutality of the police after the stockade, public opinion turned against them, the 13 miners charged with treason were all acquitted and police numbers were dramatically cut.|$|E
25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E

500|$|... "Overprotected" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jocelyn Vena of MTV said that [...] "with songs like [...] "Overprotected" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be," [...] Spears {{seemed to be}} letting out her adolescent angst," [...] while Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom said, [...] "the real <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> with emancipation from [...] teen pop past came with [...] ". While reviewing Spears' third studio album Britney (2001), Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the track, along with [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] and [...] "What It's Like to Be Me", [...] "are pivotal moments on Britney Spears' third album, the record where she strives to deepen her persona (not {{the same thing as}} her character, of course), making it more adult while still recognizably Britney".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the album were strong but dropped off disappointingly as {{contemporary}} reviews of the album were mixed. Critic Ira Robbins wrote [...] "although this casual loud-rock outing... seems on <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> to be slapdash and slight, the first side is actually quite good, offering provocative pop-culture lyrics delivered with first-take enthusiasm and carefree backing." [...] In 1987, Spin magazine called the album [...] "an inspired and brilliantly crafted work. It's charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food; imbued with the contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on", but in 1989 a different reviewer for the magazine called the album [...] "disappointing". Rolling Stone magazine called the work an [...] "odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies," [...] "unfocused," [...] and possibly [...] "the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. ... Being noisy and sloppy isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sad to say, Never Let Me Down is also something of a mess." [...] Another critic held a general optimism for {{the potential of the}} songs on the album, complaining only that the [...] "oppressive production" [...] ruined the songs. Billboard magazine's 1987 retrospective issue called Never Let Me Down [...] "arguably the year's most underrated release" [...] and considered the album a [...] "Critic's Choice" [...] for the year.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E

60|$|If he {{had read}} it, the book would not have eased him off to sleep, {{but he did not}} even try, to read it. He had no wish to sleep. The waking dream in which he lost himself was more {{interesting}} than any vision of slumber could have been, and he had no desire to end it. In that he could still be talking with the girl whose mystery appealed to him so pleasingly. It was none the less pleasing because, at what might be called her <b>first</b> <b>blushes,</b> she did not strike him as altogether ingenuous, but only able to discipline herself into a final sincerity from a consciousness which had been taught wisdom by experience.|$|R

500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled {{to the brim with}} dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E

Even Ludwig von Mises, his disciple, said in his autobiography, Memoirs (1978), that Wieser had misunderstood {{the gist of the}} subjectivism of the Austrian School and was actually a member of the Lausanne School. But in both he also presents a clear methodological individualism and a rejection of historicism of the German school, so at <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> it is difficult to justify his exclusion from the Austrian School.|$|E
2500|$|In {{exchange}} for his cooperation, Hogan gave Kase the exclusive rights to the inside story when the arrests were made in mid-January 1951. Kase wrote in the Journal-American that [...] "a <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of sympathy for the corrupted weaklings {{has given way to}} a cold rage because of their lack of loyalty to their school and a calloused greed for their Judas pieces of silver." [...] After Kase's expose, the point shaving scandal spread as players at Long Island University, the University of Kentucky and Bradley University were also implicated. It was ultimately shown that five players on Kentucky's 1949 NCAA championship team were involved or implicated in point shaving. Two of the players were suspended for life by the NBA, and Kentucky did not play the 1952–1953 season because of the scandal. The college basketball point shaving scandals uncovered by Kase were considered the most serious in American sports since the 1919 Black Sox Scandal.|$|E

60|$|I ventured on {{administering}} {{a sovereign}} apiece to Isa and Jane Druce. The <b>first</b> <b>blushed</b> and owned {{that it was}} very welcome, as her wardrobe had never recovered a great thunderstorm at Oxford. Jane's awkwardness made her seem {{as if it were an}} offence on my part, but her mother tells me it made her very happy. Her father says that she tells him he was hard on Avice, a great favourite of his, and that I must ask Jane to explain, for it is beyond him. It is all right about the Oxford girl. I have engaged her, and she goes home to-morrow to prepare herself. This afternoon she is delighted to assist her young ladies in their preparations. I liked her much in the private interview. I was rather surprised to find that it was 'Miss Avice,' of whom she spoke with the greatest fervour, as having first made friends with her, and then having constantly lent her books and read to her in her illness.|$|R
2500|$|At <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> {{it seemed}} ridiculous that the Knights {{would agree to}} the proposal. The Knights were powerful, FOTLU was weak and the Knights were {{dismantling}} the federation seemingly at will. But the situation was more complex than that. A number of former FOTLU craft unions had affiliated with the Knights, and they formed a powerful and cohesive clique within the labor organization. [...] Additionally, many of these unions had been raided by other labor organizations belonging to the Knights, or had their job actions broken by scab workers belonging to the Knights. [...] These unions were now ready to undercut the Knights in the Philadelphia negotiations. At the same time, some important Knight leaders had quietly approached Grand Master Workman Terence V. Powderly, and convinced him of that many of FOTLU's grievances were justified. Additionally, {{the collapse of the}} Southwest rail strike was putting pressure on Powderly to seek breathing room.|$|E
2500|$|Atwater {{had urged}} the Court {{to adopt a}} [...] "bright-line" [...] rule that the police not arrest anyone for an offense that did not carry jail time unless the {{government}} could show a compelling need to detain the person. [...] At <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules {{that are easy to}} apply on the spot. [...] But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. [...] Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to know the details of [...] "frequently complex penalty schemes," [...] especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs. [...] Furthermore, even if the officer could make that distinction on the spot, he could not know how the district attorney will later choose to charge the offense.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mahlon" [...] (or rather [...] "Machlon,") [...] "and Chillon": The names, {{unlike those}} of the parents, are devoid of {{theological}} tinge, and, in these modern times at all events, their import is liable to endless debate. One would at the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of consideration suppose that the one meant [...] "sickliness", and the other [...] "consumptiveness", or [...] "consumption" [...] - rather uninteresting and melancholy ideas. But they are peculiarly confounding when we consider that the individuals, so named in our story, had apparently inherited a delicate constitution, which developed in both of them into premature [...] "sickliness and decay", being perhaps [...] "weakly and consumptive persons"; and it appears they both died young. After {{the death of their}} father, the two sons married Moabite women and this was a violation of the Mosaic law (Deuteronomy 7:3; 23:3; Ezra 9:2; Nehemiah 13:23); so Jewish writers say that the early deaths of both the young men were divine judgments inflicted on them for those unlawful connections. It is a tradition of the Jews, mentioned by Aben Ezra, that these are the same with [...] "Joash and Saraph", who are said to have dominion in Moab, [...] which is not likely.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, two {{associates}} at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough in South Carolina reviewed how the MVFCAFA {{had been}} {{interpreted by the}} courts in the intervening eight years. [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> [...] {{appeared to be a}} big win for automobile dealers," [...] they observed. But courts had construed it narrowly, as applicable only to the actual franchise agreement and not any separate dealer-manufacturer agreements even where the disputed conduct touched on issues referenced in the franchise agreement. Most cases had thus turned on whether contract law {{in the state of the}} dispute allowed the separate agreement to be treated as incorporated by reference into the franchise agreement. Courts had also rejected in most cases a reading of the law as intended to protect dealers, holding that it may not be used by them to compel arbitration with the manufacturer when it would prefer to litigate. [...] "Despite the Congressional attempt to tip the balance of power between dealers and manufacturers in favor of dealers, courts have allowed manufacturers to retain their ability to compel arbitration in many of the disputes that arise between dealers and manufacturers," [...] they concluded.|$|E

60|$|In the {{presence}} of the exact proprieties of modern Fiction, Art, and Drama, I am shy of touching on the question of what should be mentioned, and seen--and should not. All that I care to say, here, is that Byron tells you of realities, and that their being pretty ones is, to my mind,--at the <b>first</b> (literally) <b>blush,</b> of the matter, rather in his favor. If however you have imagined that he means you to think Dudu as pretty as Myrrha,[94] or even Haidee, whether in full dress or none, as pretty as Marina, it is your fault, not his.|$|R
