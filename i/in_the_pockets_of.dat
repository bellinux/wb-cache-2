5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E

Papers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the drowned man identify him as the heir, John Harmon. Present at the identification is a mysterious young man, who gives his name as Julius Handford and then disappears.|$|E

500|$|Many constituencies, {{especially}} those with small electorates, were {{under the control of}} rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that [...] "The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!" [...] T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 1, 1998, the EPB {{published}} {{a press release}} claiming responsibility for {{an attack on a}} facility housing machinery and equipment being used to build the Superaqueduct, one of the Roselló administration's flagship projects. The organization informed that two of its Special Military Units, identified by the names [...] "Manolo el Leñero" [...] and [...] "Francisco Pachín Marín", infiltrated the locale during the previous night. The EPB cited that the government had been working on the project during nighttime, despite the existence of a case in the Appellation Circuit emitted an opinion stating that it lacked proper permits from several agencies including the Department of Natural Resources and that it violated zoning and construction laws, as the justification for their actions. Referring to the Roselló administration as a [...] "political mafia", the organization stated that the government acted [...] "in a dictatorial manner" [...] by [...] "disrespecting the Puerto Rican courts, with no hesitance" [...] and [...] "ignoring the positive and economic alternatives proposed by legitimate defenders of the environment [...] to satisfy the economic interests of private developers." [...] The EPB further argued that the large investment in this and other projects [...] "would end <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> corrupt" [...] individuals, predicting that a portion of it would be used to fund the PNP's political campaign and its lobbyists in Washington. The organization made argued that the environmental damage to the central region and Lago Dos Bocas would be irreparable, also criticizing that the water was only being redirected to the metropolitan area. The group cited local scientists opposed to the Superaqueduct by stating that the effect would also affect Río Grande estuary and the natural reserve of Caño Tiburones in Arecibo, besides offering a subpar quality of water that could endanger the public health. The EPB also expressed concern in the competentcy of those manning the machinery, claiming that it could endanger the safety of children, concluding that these actions formed part of an initiative of [...] "policy of National Salvation" [...] that intended to protect sectors of the general public and workers of entities that the Roselló administration intended to privatize, such as the Puerto Rico Telephone Company. Los Macheteros claimed responsibility for an explosion at a small power station in the San Juan metropolitan area. The explosion caused limited power outages.|$|E

HBOT has clinical and anecdotal support.|$|E
2500|$|The first written {{mentions}} of {{the town}} are as Egerscug (1247) and Egerszeg (1293); the name means [...] "alder-tree corner" [...] and is probably {{a reference to the}} town's situation in the angle where two rivers meet. King Béla IV donated the town to the diocese of Veszprém in 1266, so that it became church property. As Egerszeg lay somewhat distant from Veszprém, however, the taxes paid by the town often ended up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> such local oligarchs as the Kőszegi family.|$|E

2500|$|In late April, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice {{alleged that}} {{soldiers}} loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to commit rapes in rebel-held or disputed areas. The allegations surfaced in an Al Jazeera report {{the previous month}} from Libya-based doctors, {{who claimed to have}} found Viagra <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> government soldiers. Human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war. The British aid agency [...] "Save the children" [...] said it got reports that children were raped by unknown perpetrators, but warned that these reports could not be confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|During a radio {{interview}} in Australia, Spitz {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money.

Attempts by the FBI's Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU) and the American Cryptogram Association failed to decipher the meanings of those two coded notes, which are listed {{as one of the}} CRRU’s top unsolved cases. On March 29, 2011, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an appeal for help from the public in obtaining the meaning of the messages. A few days later, they updated their website to note the [...] "outpouring of responses", and established a separate page where the public can offer comments and theories.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{heaviest}} casualty, however, was the city. Detroit's losses went {{a hell of}} a lot {{deeper than}} the immediate toll of lives and buildings. The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosionthe outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone {{steadily}} reduced Income tax {{over the}} course of his tenure as Chancellor. In 1861 the tax was reduced to ninepence (£0–0s–9d), in 1863 to sevenpence, in 1864 to fivepence and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money [...] "fructify <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the people" [...] by keeping taxation levels down through [...] "peace and retrenchment". [...] In 1859 he wrote to his brother, who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: [...] "Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it) in my financial creed. [...] The controversy between direct and indirect taxation holds a minor, though important place". He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: [...] "I am certain, from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life. It is just like learning the grammar then, which when once learned need not be referred to afterwards".|$|E
2500|$|Yang {{states that}} people's democracy, unlike {{parliamentary}} democracy, realises {{the principle of}} [...] "popular sovereignty". The basis for {{the argument is that}} in a parliamentary democracy, a system in which ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money—when parties have money, they get it from the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are financed state, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that;All political parties [...] bear the trust of the people, all implement their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and serve the people.|$|E

2500|$|After {{years of}} heavy {{drinking}} (including consumption of absinthe), Satie died on 1 July 1925 from cirrhosis of the liver. He {{is buried in}} the cemetery in Arcueil. There is a tiny stone monument designating a grassy area {{in front of an}} apartment building – 'Parc Erik Satie'. Over the course of his 27 years in residence at Arcueil, where Satie lived in stark simplicity, no one had ever visited his room. After his death, Satie's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos. Among many other unsorted papers and miscellaneous items, it contained a large number of umbrellas, and two grand pianos placed {{one on top of the}} other, the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels. They discovered compositions that were either thought to have been lost or totally unknown. The score to Jack in the Box was thought, by Satie, to have been left on a bus years before. These were found behind the piano, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his velvet suits, and in other odd places, and included Vexations; Geneviève de Brabant and other unpublished or unfinished stage works; The Dreamy Fish; many Schola Cantorum exercises; a previously unseen set of [...] "canine" [...] piano pieces; and several other works for piano, many untitled.
