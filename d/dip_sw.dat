From Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter gridded data we observed that {{in the center of}} Isidis the − 3700 m and − 3800 m isolines strike NW-SE, being quasi-parallel to the diameter of the basin. We interpreted this as evidence that the basement of Isidis Planitia was faulted prior to being completely covered by layers of sediments and volcanic rocks. Plotting the morphometric data of impact craters located {{on the floor of the}} basin in a measured depths vs. predicted depths diagram (MPD), we concluded that the fault planes should <b>dip</b> <b>SW,</b> which is consistent with the location of the most topographically depressed sector of Isidis Planitia. We also estimated a minimum vertical displacement of ~ 1 – 2 km. Considering that the crust under Isidis Planitia is only a few km thick, our estimate implies brittle behavior of the lithosphere under the basin, suggesting that a low geothermal gradient and rheologically strong material characterize this Martian location...|$|E

Geomagnetic and bathymetric surveys were carried out in the east off Ishigaki Island to investigate faults and basement structure. Two distinct faults, striking NW-SE and <b>dipping</b> <b>SW,</b> were found between Ishigaki Island and Tarama Island. In order to estimate the primary productivity of algal symbiont·bearing larger foraminifera in low-latitude shelf environments, surface sediments were quantitatively sampled from an island shelf off the west of Miyako Island. The planktic foraminiferal genus PuUeniatina is an important paleoceanographic proxy in the Ryukyu Arc region, indicating either the past Kuroshio Current or variations in winter sea surface temperature for the late Quaternary. Plankton tows and cm protlles in the upper 200 m depth were taken at three stations along 125 °E to correlate the ecological distribution of PuUeniatina with hydrographic environmental properties.

40|$|The Padul-Nigüelas Fault Zone (PNFZ) is {{situated}} at the south-western mountain front of the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) in the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordilleras and belongs to a NW-SE trending system of normal faults <b>dipping</b> <b>SW.</b> The PNFZ constitutes a major tectonic and lithological boundary in the Betics, and separates the metamorphic units of the Alpujárride Complex from Upper Tertiary to Quaternary deposits. Due to recent seismicity and several morphological and geological indicators, such as preserved fault scarps, triangular facets, deeply incised valleys and faults in the colluvial wedges, the PNFZ is suspected to be a tectonically active feature of the south-eastern Granada Basin. We performed morphotectonic GIS analyses based on digital elevation models (DEM, cell size: 10 m) to obtain tectonic activity classes for each outcropping segment of the PNFZ. We have determined the following geomorphic indices: mountain front sinuosity, stream-length gradient index, concavity index and valley floor width to height ratio. The results show a differentiation in the states of activity along the fault zone strike. The western and eastern segments of the PNFZ indicate a higher tectonic activity compared {{to the center of}} the fault zone. We discuss and critically examine the comparability and reproducibility of geomorphic analyses, concluding that careful interpretation is necessary, if no ground-truthing can be performed...|$|R

From the base to the top, themetasedimentary rocks are grouped into the following sequences: Panelinha Formation consisting of coarse-grainedimmature clastics; the overlying Itaimbé Subgroup which is made up of the Camacã Formation (metapelites with localcarbonates), the Água Preta Formation (fi ne-grained metapsamites and local carbonate lenses), Serra do Paraíso Formation(metacarbonates and quartzites) and the Santa Maria Eterna Formation (metaconglomerates and metacarbonates). TheSalobro Formation was deposited unconformably on this sequence and consists of coarse-grained immature and local fi negrainedclastic rocks. The Rio Pardo Group was affected by three successive folding events, which were recorded in twolitho-structural units. The litho-structural unit 1 {{is located in}} the northeastern part of the basin, and the litho-structural unit 2, in the southwestern part of the basin.

The second unit is polyphasic andshows large folds with NE vergence. A third folding is represented by folds and foliations present at the western marginof the basin. The NE vergence of the Rio Pardo Group can be explained by changes in the deformation regime and in thedirection of the principal axis of deformation in the north sector of the Araçuaí belt during the Brasiliano collision orogen. The tectonic transport to the north could be the cause of deformation of the Rio Pardo Group...|$|R

40|$|The Black Bay Shear Zone, northwestern Saskatchewan, {{lies within}} the Rae Province of the Canadian Shield. It {{is one of}} several major, {{northeast}} trending, steeply dipping shear zones that were active during the Paleoproterozoic Trans-­Hudson or Thelon Orogenies. For part of its exposed length of approximately 50 km it separates Archean supracrustal gneisses of the Tazin Group to the northwest, from the unconformably overlying Paleoproterozoic, red-bed sequence of the Martin Group to the southeast. Deformation fabrics along the Black Bay Shear Zone indicate the sequential development of early ductile to late brittle episodes of movement. The early ductile episode (D 1, pre-Martin Gp) is characterized by a 1 km-wide mylonite belt in the Tazin gneisses, with mylonitic lamination (C-fabric), dextral ä-asymmetric winged porphyroclasts, stretch lineation (L 1) and rare sheath folds. This was followed by a ductile to brittle transition (D 2, also pre-Martin Gp) characterized by small asymmetric folds in C, and small post-C compressional and extensional shear bands (SB) ranging from thin ductile shear zones to brittle fractures commonly vein filled. The late brittle phase (D 3, post-Martin Gp), to which uranium vein mineralization is related, included the formation of a major brittle fault zone along the southeastern side of the mylonitic shear zone, and several sets of vein filled joints. Movement directions during D 1 to D 3 are reflected by various shear sense indicators. The D 1 dextral ä-asymmetrical winged porphyroclasts, combined with the gently NE and SW plunging L 1, stretch lineation, indicate sub-horizontal dextral displacement during the ductile phase of deformation. Predominantly NE-verging and steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>SW</b> plunging minor D 2 folds, along with the predominantly dextral-verging, post-C shear bands, indicate that oblique dextral SE-side-up slip occurred during the ductile to brittle transition. Brittle movement (D 3) resulted in the preservation of an approximately 8 -km thick succession of Martin Group on the SE-side of the fault, indicating a SE-side-down vertical throw of at least 8 km. The local presence of poorly preserved, down-dip slickenlineations suggests {{that at least some of}} this movement was dip slip. Time constraints on deformation are poor, tentatively all of the Black Bay Structure deformational history took place between 2300 Ma and 1700 Ma...|$|R

The rupture zone has been subdivided into five areas with respect to seismic modelling (Mitsui et al., 2004). These five subdivisions show interesting differences in earthquake behavior: frequency of earthquakes varying on a 90 to 150-year cycle (Mitsui, et al., 2004; Tanioka et al., 2004), similar slip occurrences along the fault segments, the order of subdivision faulting, and finally, different failure features. Hydrologic observatories were placed in boreholes drilled in 2000 (IODP sites 808 and 1173) {{in an attempt to}} quantify changes in pore-fluid pressure that are a result of the oncoming Philippine Sea plate (Davis et al., 2006). Site 808 is located in the front section of the main thrust fault, while site 1173 is located approximately 11 km from the frontal thrust zone (Hitoshi et al., 2006). Other interesting results of the pressure measurements were the pressure changes that resulted from sediment deformation near boreholes and the effect of very low earthquake swarms at the time of pressure changes (Davis et al., 2006). The working hypothesis is that pressure changes indicate a change in the elastic strain within the formation (Davis et al., 2006).|$|R
40|$|International audienceFieldwork {{complemented by}} SPOT image {{analysis}} throws light on current crustal shortening {{processes in the}} ranges of northeastern Tibet (Gansu and Qinghai provinces, China). The ongoing deformation of Late-Pleistocene bajada aprons in the forelands of the ranges involves folding, at various scales, and chiefly north-vergent, seismogenic thrusts. The most active thrusts usually break the ground many kilometres north of the range-fronts, along the northeast limbs of growing, asymmetric ramp-anticlines. Normal faulting {{at the apex of}} other growing anticlines, between the range fronts and the thrust breaks, implies slip on blind ramps connecting distinct active décollement levels that deepen southwards. The various patterns of uplift of the bajada surfaces can be used to constrain plausible links between contemporary thrusts downsection. Typically, the foreland thrusts and décollements appear to splay from master thrusts that plunge at least 15 – 20 km down beneath the high ranges. Plio-Quaternary anticlinal ridges rising to more than 3000 m a. s. l. expose Palaeozoic metamorphic basement in their core. In general, the geology and topography of the ranges and forelands imply that structural reliefs of the order of 5 – 10 km have accrued at rates of 1 – 2 mm yr− 1 in approximately the last 5 Ma. From hill to range size, the elongated reliefs that result from such Late-Cenozoic, NE–SW shortening appear to follow a simple scaling law, with roughly constant length/width ratio, suggesting that they have grown self-similarly. The greatest mountain ranges, which are over 5. 5 km high, tens of kilometres wide and hundreds of kilometres long may thus be interpreted to have formed as NW-trending ramp anticlines, at the scale of the middle–upper crust. The fairly regular, large-scale arrangement of those ranges, with parallel crests separated by piggy-back basins, the coevality of many parallel, south-dipping thrusts, and a change in the scaling ratio (from # 5 to 8) for range widths greater than # 30 km further suggests that they developed {{as a result of the}} northeastward migration of large thrust ramps above a broad décollement <b>dipping</b> <b>SW</b> at a shallow angle in the middle–lower crust. This, in turn, suggests that the 400 – 500 km-wide crustal wedge that forms the northeastern edge of the Tibet–Qinghai plateau shortens and thickens as a thickskinned accretionary prism decoupled from the stronger upper mantle underneath. Such a thickening process must have been coupled with propagation of the Altyn Tagh fault towards the ENE because most thrust traces merge northwestwards with active branches of this fault, after veering clockwise. This process appears to typify the manner in which the Tibet–Qinghai highlands have expanded their surface area in the Neogene. The present topography and structure imply that, during much of that period,...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} predict {{earthquakes}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges for Earth Sciences. Radon has been suggested as one possible precursor, and its groundwater anomalies associated with earthquakes and water-rock interactions were proposed in several seismogenic areas worldwide as due to possible transport of radon through microfractures, or due to crustal gas fluxes along active faults. However, the use of radon as a possible earthquake's precursor is not clearly linked to crustal deformation. It is shown in this paper that uranium groundwater anomalies, which were observed in cataclastic rocks crossing the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory, can be used as a possible strain meter in domains where continental lithosphere is subducted. Measurements evidence clear, sharp anomalies from July, 2008 to the end of March, 2009, related to a preparation phase of the seismic swarm, which occurred near L'Aquila, Italy, from October, 2008 to April, 2009.

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} Curitiba basin {{is located}} in the Central-Southern part of the first Parananense plateau, and comprises Curitiba (PR), and part of the neighbour Municipalities (fig. 1). It is supposed to be of Plio-Pleistocene age. It has a shallow sedimentary fulfillment, represented by the Guabirotuba formation (BIGARELLA and SALAMUNI, 1962) which is dristributed over a large area of about 3. 000 km 2. The internal geometry, not entirely known yet, is actually object of detailed research, that shows its geological evolution to Cenozoic tectonic movements. For {{the purpose of this study}} the definition of the structural contour of the basement and their depo-centers is fundamental. This paper presents the results of the integration of surface and subsurface data, processed by statistical methods, which allowed a more precise definition of the morphostructural framework of the basement. For the analysis of the geological spacial data, specific softwares were used for statistical processing for trend surfaces analysis. The data used in this study are of following types: a) drilling logs for ground water; b) description of surface points of geological maps (CRPM, 1977); c) description of points of geotechnical drillings and down geological survey. The data of 223 drilling logs for ground water were selected out of 770 wells. The description files of 700 outcrops, as well as planialtimetric field data, were used for the localization of the basement outcrop. Thus, a matrix with five columns was set up: utm E-W (x) and utm N-S (y); surface altitude (z); altimetric cote of the contact between sedimentary rocks and the basement (k); isopachs (l). For the study of the basement limits, the analysis of surface trends of 2 (nd) and 3 (rd) degree polinomial for the altimetric data (figs. 2 and 3) were used. For the residuals the method of the inverse of the square of the distance (fig. 4) was used. The adjustments and the explanations of the surfaces were made with the aid of multiple linear regressions. The analysis of 3 rd degree polinomial trend surface (fig. 3) confirmed that the basement tends to be more exposed towards NNW-SSE explaining better the data trend through an ellipse, which striking NE-SW and <b>dipping</b> <b>SW</b> axis coincides with the trough of the basin observed in the trending surface of the basement. The performed analysis and the respective images offer a good degree of certainty of the geometric model of the Curitiba Basin and of the morphostructure of its basement. The surface trend allows to sketch with a greater degree of confidence the structural contour of the topgraphic surface (figs. 5 and 6) and of the basement (figs. 7 and 8), as well as the delimitation of intermediate structural heights, which were responsible for isolated and assymmetric depocenters. These details are shown in the map of figures 9 and 10. Thus, the Curitiba Basin is made up by a structural trough stretching NE-SW, with maximum preserved depths of about 80 m, which are separated by heights and depocenters striking NW-SE (fig. 11).

Fault plane solutions of the 1999 shock indicate that it was associated with a normal fault trending WNW-ESE and <b>dipping</b> to <b>SW.</b> Field geological observations conducted after the event in the Fili neotectonic fault, situated at 15 – 20 km to the north of Athens, imply that it has possibly been the seismogenic structure of the main rupture, and that it reactivated in very recent geological times. Archaeoseismological observations performed in the ancient Fili Fort, revealed repaired structural damage that was very likely caused by an earthquake occurring in palaeochristianic or Byzantine times. From a new catalogue of historical earthquakes it results that the main events of 1705, 1805 and 1889 could be tentatively located within a distance of ∼ 30 km from Athens although the little macroseismic information available makes their locations quite uncertain. During the instrumental period of observation, only few small shocks were recorded in the Athens region. It is obvious that should a research effort had been undertaken before the 1999 earthquake, certainly it would be concluded that at least one strong earthquake took place in historical times in the broad region affected in 1999, and that the Fili fault is active and is capable to produce strong shocks in the future. However, such a study was never conducted by the scientific community beforehand.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The IICSZ is a N 45 °-trending, 30 km wide, intracratonic shear zone, {{extending}} {{for some}} 150 km through the SSE {{portion of the}} Bahia State. The IICSZ {{is closely related to}} dykes and syenites of the Alkaline Igneous Suite of Southern Bahia and, to the Southwest, it is interrupted by the N 140 °-trending, Potiragua Shear Zone (PSZ), that establishes the tectonic limit of the Neoproterozoic Araçuaí Fold Belt and the Archaean-Proterozoic São Francisco Craton. The PSZ <b>dips</b> to <b>SW</b> and the IICSZ to NW, though the latter swaps northeastwards into a symmetric, positive, flower structure. A paleostress analysis based on the orientation of thousands of fault planes and fractures found in dykes and host rocks, coupled with the analysis of several kinematic indicators suggest that both shear zones evolved during a N-S compression and were later, perhaps progressively, reactivated by a E-W compressional tectonic event. Paleostress fields in both the IICSZ and PSZ were controlled by the orientation of the far-field stress, disturbances in field stress around re-activated shear zones, 3 D-geometry of shear zones, tension concentration ('channeling') along shear zones, position of secondary faults and fractures, and orientation of shear zones, in relation to both the limit of the Araçuaí Fold Belt and the São Francisco Craton, and the site of intersection between the IICSZ and the PSZ (where the tension vectors converged to).

We applied the Best Estimate Method (BEM), which collapses hypocentral clouds, {{to the events}} of low energy (Md max = 4. 1) seismic sequences in order to constrain the location and geometry of the seismogenetic structures. The results indicate that earthquakes aligned along three main structures: two sub-parallel structures striking NW–SE (1990 – 1992, Benevento sequence) and one structure striking NE–SW (1997, Sannio sequence). The southernmost NW–SE structure, which dips towards NE, overlies the fault that is likely to be responsible for a larger historical earthquake (Io max = XI MCS, 1688 earthquake). The northernmost NW–SE striking structure <b>dips</b> towards <b>SW.</b> The NE–SW striking structure is sub-vertical and it is located at the northern tip of the fault segment supposed to be responsible for the 1688 earthquake. The spatio-temporal evolution of the 1990 – 1997 seismicity indicates a progressive migration from SE (Benevento) to NW (Sannio) associated to a deepening of hypocenters (i. e., from about 5 to 12 km). Hypocenters cluster at the interface between the major structural discontinuities (e. g., pre-existing thrust surfaces) or within higher rigidity layers (e. g., the Apulia carbonates). Available focal mechanisms from earthquakes occurred on the recognized NW–SE and NE–SW faults are consistent with dip-slip normal solutions.

The lateral extent of the fault segments range from 5 to 10 km and make up a broad, 45 km long, NW trending fault system. The geometry of each segment is quite simple and consists of planar faults gently <b>dipping</b> toward <b>SW</b> with an average dip of 40 – 45.

To this scope, a morphostructural analysis {{has been carried out}} to map morpholineaments, land surfaces, and other morphotectonic markers. Further, structural data about fault and fracture systems have been collected from both surface and subsurface survey, using in the latter case the extended net of explored karst caves.

The study area is located inside the National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano and is bordered by two major rivers such as the Calore and Tanagro rivers, along which there are many villages and small towns. This area has been repeatedly affected in the last centuries by the effects of the activity of a regional, partly blind, NW-SE-striking fault system responsible for several huge earthquakes. From a morphostructural viewpoint, The Alburni Mts constitute a quite simple NW-SE-trending monocline, <b>dipping</b> toward <b>SW.</b> The massif covers an area of about 250 km 2 crossed by several sets of faults, often showing a clear morphological expression, responsible for the genesis of a squared framework of flat-topped ridges and flat-bottomed valleys {{at the top of the}} massif. Its geological backbone is made of a thick succession of Mesozoic and Cenozoic limestones, partly referred to a back-reef environment, locally covered by Miocene terrigenous units. Such unit derives from the deformation of the African-Apulian palaeodomain of the Campania-Lucania Platform (D’Argenio et al., 1975; Patacca and Scandone, 2007). Cretaceous to Oligocene deep-sea internal units have been also trapped in some extensional troughs at the top of the massif, after their regional thrusting on the African palaeomargin units...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRegional surface gravity {{data and}} global {{satellite}} magnetic data have been utilized {{to generate a}} preliminary model of the crustal structure along a southwest–northeast profile (Gadra–Fatehpur) through western Rajasthan. The study area represents {{the western part of}} the Indian continental landmass which has undergone several major episodes of repeated subduction/collision, plume traces and rifting from Archaean to recent times. The temporal and spatial relationship between the various geotectonic provinces is quite complex, thereby limiting the emergence of a suitable crustal structure model for this region. Exposures of the Malani Igneous Suite (MIS), a product of bimodal volcanism (∼ 780  Ma), and considered to be the third largest felsic magmatic province of the world, is evident along the profile and also to the southwest of the study area. The easternmost part of the profile is close to the DAFB (Delhi Aravalli Fold Belt), a Proterozoic orogenic belt. This study probes the geometry of the different crustal units in terms of density and susceptibility variations in order to decipher the imprints of the major tectonic processes the region has undergone. In order to decipher the crustal geometry of the Gadra–Fatehpur profile, two NW–SE gravity and magnetic profile vertical sections (A–A′ in the south and B–B′ in the north) are modelled on the basis of the constraints provided from previous seismic models. The crustal model of the Gadra–Fatehpur profile is composed of alluvium, Tertiary sediments, MIS, Marwar Supergroup, low-density layers (LDLs) and the middle–lower crustal layers, with a distinct change in configuration from the southwest to northeast. The Moho <b>dips</b> from <b>SW</b> to NE, the MIS in the SW gives way to the thick pile of the Marwar Supergroup to the NE. The evolution of MIS has been suggested to have occurred as a consequence of delamination of the upper mantle. LDLs are incorporated in Gadra–Fatehpur model. In the SW, LDL (2550  kg/m 3) lies below the MIS in the NE, another LDL (2604  kg/m 3) is depicted below the mid-crustal layer...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) {{was used}} to {{determine}} the seismogenic fault and slip distribution of the 3 July 2015 Pishan earthquake in the Tarim Basin, western China. We obtained a coseismic deformation map from the ascending and descending Sentinel- 1 A satellite Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode and the ascending Advanced Land Observation Satellite- 2 (ALOS- 2) satellite Fine mode InSAR data. The maximum ground uplift and subsidence were approximately 13. 6 cm and 3. 2 cm, respectively. Our InSAR observations associated with focal mechanics indicate that the source fault <b>dips</b> to southwest (<b>SW).</b> Further nonlinear inversions show that the dip angle of the seimogenic fault is approximate 24 °, with a strike of 114 °, which is similar with the strike of the southeastern Pishan fault. However, this fault segment responsible for the Pishan event has not been mapped before. Our finite fault model reveals that the peak slip of 0. 89 m occurred at a depth of 11. 6 km, with substantial slip at a depth of 9 – 14 km and a near-uniform slip of 0. 2 m at a depth of 0 – 7 km. The estimated moment magnitude was approximately Mw 6. 5, consistent with seismological results...|$|R
40|$|The {{stereographic}} projection of P-wave first motions for the 3 August 1993 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake, its largest aftershock (16 h 33 min), {{and for the}} 22 November 1995 earthquake were constructed using the polarity readings of regional and teleseismic stations. The focal mechanism solutions of the 3 August 1993 mainshock and its largest aftershock represent a normal faulting mechanism with some left lateral strike slip component. The nodal planes selected as the fault imply high similarity in strike and dip. They are related to a local fault striking NW-SE and <b>dipping</b> to the <b>SW.</b> The selected fault planes are in good agreement with the aftershock distribution. For the main shock of the 22 November 1995, the fault plane solution displays the same mechanism (normal faulting with left lateral strike slip component) with a plane striking N-S and dipping to the west. The fault plane is greatly conformable with {{the direction of the}} regional tectonics and also with the aftershock distribution. The main trend of the extension stress pattern is in a NE-SW direction, corresponding to the rifting direction of the Gulf of Suez and {{may be related to the}} paleostress along the Gulf of Suez and Aqaba during the Middle to Late Miocene...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} {{the results of}} detailed mapping and analysis of structures encountered in Seguelen pit of Siguiri gold mine, Guinea, where the Siguiri mine is geo-tectonically located in the Baoulé-Mossi domain of Man Shield in West African craton. The gold deposit is hosted in low-grade metamorphic sediments of turbidites sequences which form part of the Lower Proterozoic of Birimian Super group. Three rock formations of Balato, Fatoya and Kintinian underlay the overall pits. The Siguiri gold mine {{is characterized by the}} deep weathering profile, developed over the rocks reaching 200 m below the surface in some areas and often capped by the lateritic gravel or duricrust. The rock formations at Seguelen area are characterised by strong bedding monotonously <b>dipping</b> towards <b>SW</b> and trending NW-SE. The lithology of the host rocks has strong control on the disseminated mineralisation throughout the deposit. Two domains of rock formations are clearly distinguished at Seguelen:  Fatoya Formation(Ffm) domain; and  Kintinian Formation (Kfm) domain. The two domains are separated by a contact zone of 1. 7 m wide parallel to bedding and characterised by the presence of quartz fragments as well as thinly sheeted shale and black shale. This contact zone is identified as disconformity. The major tectonic deformation which has affected the region is known as D 2 corresponding to the Eburnean orogeny. The major D 2 related structures is the regional thrust striking N-S over an area of 12 km long and 3 km wide and within which corridors all Siguiri gold Mine open pits are located. In the N-S trending structures, there is east-northeast shortening and north-northwest extension. There is pervasive hydrothermal alteration (carbonatization and sideritization) and supergene alteration in the all pits. The hydrothermal alteration attests the intensity of hydrothermal fluid-flow over the host rocks. The hydrothermal fluids flowed along the fractures and within the wall rocks through bedding plans to form numerous auriferous quartz veins bearing disseminated sulphides through chemical reaction between fluids and wall rocks, which are remarkable at Seguelen pit. Three quartz vein sets are distinguished at Seguelen:  NNE-SSW quartz vein set  NE-SW quartz vein set  NW-SE quartz vein set The NE-SW and NNE-SSW quartz veins are often lenticular and associated with the bulk mineralisation...|$|R
40|$|With {{more than}} 250 caves, the Alburni Mts {{represent}} {{one of the}} most important karst areas of southern Italy. The backbone of this ridge is constituted of Mesozoic-Cenozoic limestone with limited outcrops of Miocene siliciclastic formations and internal shale units, often trapped in elongated downthrown structures. NW-SE- and NE-SW-trending faults with a clear morphological expression are responsible for the genesis of a squared framework of flat-topped ridges and flat-bottomed valleys at the top of the massif. In an approximate way, the Alburni Mts can be described as a roughly NW-SE-trending monocline, <b>dipping</b> toward the <b>SW,</b> covering an area of about 350 km 2. The fault system has partially disrupted an ancient flat landscape, as testified by the widespread fragments of the Southern Apennines late Pliocene - early Pleistocene summit palaeosurface. This work aims at understanding the role played by tectonic structures on karst development based upon a morphometric analysis. We also try to constrain the age of the karst phenomena using the relationships among morpholineaments, land surfaces, and other morphotectonic markers. New data, besides confirming the role of the map-scale faults as a controlling factor of the surface and hypogean karst development, also highlight the strong influence of the small-scale faults and pervasive jointing. Further, the presence of different levels of hypogean karst seems to trace the arrangement in several orders of land surfaces, thus suggesting a discontinuous lowering of the (relative) erosion base level due to a multi-phase tectonic uplift...|$|R
40|$|On 6 April (01 : 32 UTC) 2009 aMW 6. 1 normal {{faulting}} earthquake {{struck the}} axial {{area of the}} Abruzzo region in central Italy. We study the geometry of fault segments using high resolution foreshock and aftershock locations. Two main <b>SW</b> <b>dipping</b> segments, the L’Aquila and Campotosto faults, forming an en echelon system 40 km long (NW trending). The 16 km long L’Aquila fault shows a planar geometry with constant dip (∼ 48 °) through the entire upper crust down to 10 km depth. The Campotosto fault activated by three events with 5. 0 ≤ MW ≤ 5. 2 shows a striking listric geometry, composed by planar segments with different dips along depth rather than a smoothly curving single fault surface. The investigation of the spatiotemporal evolution of foreshock activity within the crustal volume where the subsequent L’Aquila main shock nucleated allows us to image the progressive activation of the main fault plane. From the beginning of 2009 the foreshocks activated the deepest portion of the fault until {{a week before the}} main shock, when the largest foreshock (MW 4. 0) triggered a minor antithetic segment. Seismicity jumped back to the main plane a few hours before the main shock. Secondary synthetic and antithetic fault segments are present both on the hanging and footwall of the system. The stress tensor obtained by inverting focal mechanisms of the largest events reveals a NE trending extension and the majority of the aftershocks are kinematically consistent. Deviations from the dominant extensional strain pattern are observed for those earthquakes activating minor structures...|$|R
40|$|The Middleton Place Summerville Seismic Zone (MPSSZ), {{located about}} 20 km {{northwest}} of Charleston {{is the most}} active seismic zone in South Carolina. Between 1980 and 1991, 58 events with M e 0. 8 to 3. 3 were recorded in MPSSZ. They lie in a diffuse area of 11 km by 14 km of which over two-thirds are located in a narrow 5 km by 6 -km zone. The hypocentral depths range from 2 to 11 km with over 90 % deeper than 4 km. Single fault plane solutions were obtained for 35 events. Based on the focal mechanisms the earthquakes were grouped into five subsets. The mean P-axis of all fault plane solutions is oriented N 63 °E, in general agreement with the direction of SHmax obtained from in situ stress measurements. Of the 35 events, 18 are associated with reverse faulting on NW- SE striking and <b>SW</b> <b>dipping</b> fault planes. These events were inferred {{to be associated with}} the Ashley River fault zone, which is not a planar feature, but is composed of short segments of varying strikes (N 20 °W to N 70 °W) and dips (40 ° to 70 °SW). Eleven events were associated with strike-slip motion on NNE-SSW striking vertical faults and with thrust faulting on N-S oriented faults dipping to the west, respectively. These two sets are identified as being parts of the Wood-stock fault zone. The concentrated zone of seismicity included events associated with both the ARF and WF zones suggesting that it is at the intersection of these two fault zones...|$|R
5000|$|Earthquakes {{occur as}} a {{consequence}} of gradual stress increases in a region, and once it reaches the maximum stress that the rocks can withstand a rupture generates and the resulting earthquake motion is related to a drop in the shear stress of the system. Earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs, the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the Earth like ripples over water. The causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated, by the formation of longitudinal shear cracks that were analysed using mathematical models. The different distributions of initial stress, sliding frictional stress, and specific fracture energy are all taken into account. If the initial stress minus the sliding frictional stress (with respect to the initial crack) is low, and the specific fracture energy or the strength of the crustal material (relative to the amount of stress) is high then slow earthquakes will occur regularly.In other words, slow earthquakes are caused by a variety of stick-slip and creep processes intermediated between asperity-controlled brittle and ductile fracture. [...] Asperities are tiny bumps and protrusions along the faces of fractures. They are best documented from intermediate crustal levels of certain subduction zones (especially those that <b>dip</b> shallowly — <b>SW</b> Japan, Cascadia, Chile), but appear to occur on other types of faults as well, notably strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault and [...] "mega-landslide" [...] normal faults on the flanks of volcanos.|$|R
30|$|The NE–SW-trending Mae Chan fault trends SW of the {{hot springs}} area. This active, left-lateral, strike-slip fault extends 200  km to the NE into Laos, but terminates to the {{southwest}} in the Fang basin (Uttamo et al. 2003, p. 96 – 99). Where exposed by a trench near Mae Ai, 12  km northeast of Fang, the fault dips 75 °S and clearly offsets Quaternary sediment (Kosuwan et al. 2000). Offset streams and shutter ridges occur along the trace to the northeast (Fenton et al. 2003; Weldon 2015). In the Fang area, the fault is expressed physiographically as the linear edge of mountainous steep terrain to the northwest, with rolling hills to the southeast, and locally as saddles in ridges (Fig.  6). That change in topography is the contact between Paleozoic sedimentary rocks to the northwest and Cenozoic basin sediments to the southeast (Fig.  9). The fault contact is accurately located, but not exposed, {{in the bed of}} the Nam Mae Chai (river) at 0516800 E, 2206480 N, where black quartzite breccia associated with the base of the detachment is juxtaposed with sandy conglomerate (<b>dipping</b> 45 ° <b>SW)</b> of the Miocene Mae Fang Formation. The fault is clearly exposed as a vertical fault plane at the Huai Hian Reservoir (Fig.  25). The physiographic expression and these exposures show that the fault is composed of right-stepping segments at it western termination. The segments are 3 – 5  km long and the stepover zones are 0.5  km wide (Fig.  4). West {{of the hot}} springs, the MT profiles indicate a steeply dipping fault at depth (Fig.  22).|$|R
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{investigation into}} the timing, distribution, and intensity of tectonothermal events has resulted in {{an understanding of the}} tectonic evolution of the northeast Sacramento Mountains, in particular, and of the northern Sacramento Mountains in general. The application of geologic, structural, geochemical, and thermochronologic techniques has provided the relative and absolute timing of crustal and tectonic processes, leading {{to the development of a}} petrogenetic model for the evolution of the Sacramento Mountains metamorphic core complex. The metamorphic core complex was uplifted and cooled during Miocene detachment faulting (- 23 - 12 Ma). The Eagle Wash Intrusive Complex, a calc-alkalic granodioritic intrusion, was emplaced during detachment faulting at - 20 Ma, at - 3 kb and ~ 680 °C. The EWIC records rapid cooling and uplift following emplacement, at rates of > 100 °C/Ma and 1. 5 - 3 km/Ma, respectively. The EWIC was below ~ 100 °C (the closure temperature of fission tracks in apatite) by 15 Ma. The structural and thermal history for the syntectonic intrusive suite is best explained via an evolving simple shear zone. The EWIC was intruded into, or proximal to, a mylonitic shear zone. The <b>SW</b> <b>dip</b> of the myonitic foliation in the EWIC could represent a primary feature of the shear zone, or the capture of a relatively older feature by a younger detachment fault splay. The later interpretation is consistent with the thermochronologic data, which suggests that faulting continued in the east after its termination in the west. Using the thermochonologic data to develop a thermal profile of the crust, the angle of faulting was calculated to be < 30 °C. The slip-rate associated with the detachement fault, though poorly constrained, was determined to be - 4 mm/yr. This value is about half that determined from other core complexes and suggests that extension was slower here than elsewhere in the region. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Dipmeter is a {{traditional}} wireline logging tool that is proved to be very useful in hydrocarbon exploration. The introduction of microresistivity imaging tools made dipmeter almost obsolete. But dipmeter studies are useful even today {{since most of the}} old wells contain only dipmeter data and not imaging data. Also, the acquisition cost of dipmeter data is low. Present paper describes a field study using dipmeter data. In this particular field, called Field-A, only dipmeter data is available. The study was focused mainly on Sand-A, which is gas-bearing in some areas. First, structural dips were analysed. The structural dips in the coal-shale sequence below Sand-A are in the range of 20 degrees mostly towards NW and some towards <b>SW.</b> The structural <b>dips</b> of shales within Sand-A are 8 to 10 degrees in magnitude. The azimuth is NW in some wells, SW in some others and SE in a few wells. It was observed that the wells having westward <b>dips</b> (NW or <b>SW)</b> are hydrocarbon bearing and wells having SE dips are water-bearing. The structural dips in the formations above Sand-A are about 8 degrees with azimuths similar to shales within Sand-A. From the analysis of stratigraphic dips, it was observed that the main paleocurrent direction for Sand-A is towards NW. Thus the likely source for hydrocarbons will be towards NW of the area under study. From this, it may be concluded that local highs in the structure towards NW will be the prospective traps for the hydrocarbon accumulation. In the eastern direction, drilling may be restricted to area bounded by a possible fault upto which the structural dip is towards west. Thus, dipmeter studies help in identifying prospective areas and ruling out unfavourable areas...|$|R
40|$|The City of Granada {{is placed}} at the margin of a flat area known as the Granada Basin (Betic Cordillera, SE Spain) {{surrounded}} by mountains. The seismic activity in the Granada Basin is high, {{with a large number}} of earthquakes, all of them of moderate to low magnitude (Mb≤ 5. 5). Historically, earthquakes in this area have produced important material damage and human casualties; however, it is hard to evaluate their magnitude. Seismicity has its origin mostly at depths between 5 and 17 km and the focal mechanisms indicate a present stress field dominated by a tensional tensor with an associated NE-SW extensional axis. The sedimentary cover of the Granada Basin is mostly coeval with the activity of faults that bound the basin, which have controlled the stratigraphic architecture. These faults are normal, mostly with a NW-SE orientation, and <b>dipping</b> towards the <b>SW.</b> Basinwards migration of the extensional front has exhumed the footwalls of older faults, uplifting the previous Tortonian sedimentary cover, which presently outcrops as emerged ranges at the margins of the basin. This work presents preliminary results of a paleoseismic study of the Granada Fault, an NW-SE active normal fault that produces a Plio-Quaternary throw of 300 m. According to these data, slip rate has been estimated in 0. 38 mm/y (Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2003). Several palaeosoils, Pleistocene in age, have been affected by this fault. Three different events can be recognized from the accumulative throw. The vertical slip per event ranges from 5 to 7 cm. Following the empirical relationship between moment magnitude and average displacement proposed by Wells and Coppersmith (1994), a magnitude between 5. 9 and 6. 0 can be preliminary assessed for these events. The palaeosoils were sampled and dated using the Thermoluminiscence method to constrain these estimates...|$|R
40|$|The Pergola-Melandro basin (southern Apennines) is {{characterized}} by a below-average release of seismic energy within a wider earthquake-prone region. In fact, it is placed between the maximum intensity areas of two of the most destructive earthquakes reported in the Italian seismic catalogue: the M ≥ 7. 0 Agri Valley earthquake in 1857 and the Ma = 6. 9 Irpinia earthquake in 1980. In this work, we present geomorphologic analysis, electrical resistivity surveys and field data, including paleoseismologic evidence, that provided the first direct constraints on the presence of a ~ 20 km long, seismogenic fault at the western border of the Pergola-Melandro basin. We also obtained geological information on the recent deformation history of the Pergola-Melandro fault that indicates the occurrence of at least four surface faulting earthquakes since Late Pleistocene age. The empirical relationships linking fault length and magnitude would assign to the Pergola- Melandro fault an event of M ≥ 6. 5. These new data have important implication on the seismic hazard assessment of this sector of the Apennines, that also includes large cities such as Potenza, about 20 km far from the recognized Pergola-Melandro fault, and highlight the relevance of the geological approach in areas where the seismological records are poor. Finally, we discuss the Pergola-Melandro fault within the regional seismotectonic context. In particular, this fault belongs to the system of normal faults with an apenninic orientation, both NE and <b>SW</b> <b>dipping,</b> that accommodate the NE- crustal extension taking place in the area. Nearby faults, similarly oriented but with opposite dip, may coexist whether linked by secondary faults that act as slip transfer structures. This complex system of active faults would be more realistic than to consider a narrow band of faults, running along the belt axis, with an homogenous geometry and, moreover, more consistent with the high extension rate measured by historical earthquakes and geodetic data...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} {{have been}} found in the near-bottom sediments within gas venting structures in the southern basin of Lake Baikal. The Baikal basin consists of three subbasins, separated by accommodation zones: the Academician Ridge between the north and central basins, the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone between the central and south basins. The venting structures are located south of the Posolskiy Bank, which is a basement ridge with a thick sequence of sediments on top, trending NE, oblique to the main border fault. The Posolskiy Bank belongs to the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone. It is delimited at its south-eastern side by the Posolskiy Fault with a displacement of more than 1000 metres. The venting structures are located close to an ENE trending fault, parallel to the Posolskiy Fault. Besides the fault which is delimiting the venting area at its northern side, and which has a vertical offset of its northern footwall of 25 - 30 metres, a fault with a vertical offset of its eastern footwall is not more than 5 metres. The venting area corresponds to a zone of local elevation of the lake floor, which is delimited at its northern side by the ENE trending fault and which is gently <b>dipping</b> towards <b>SW</b> in its southern part. It consequently appears as a zone of updoming probably related to a fluid and gas flow from depth, finally disrupted along its northern and eastern sides. The updoming is interpreted as the consequence of the disruption of the deep gas hydrate layer resulting from fluid overpressure. This interpretation is favoured by the regional pattern of the BSR, which shows strong variations in depth over this part of the south Baikal basin: it reaches minimum depths in the venting area and drops abruptly down to significantly larger depths north of the fault delimiting the venting area. The upward migration of the BSR is interpreted as a consequence of a regional fluid flow at depth, resulting in heat transport, consequent upward migration of the gas hydrates stability zone, updoming of the area and finally disruption along a fault zone. The origin of the fluid flow is discussed. Folding structures in the lake sediments along a NW-SE to WNW-ESE trend have been described {{in different parts of the}} central and southern basins. These folding structures are assumed to be related to left-lateral strike-slip movements along the eastern side of the basin. In this assumption, the NE trending fault associated with the venting structures and the spatial alignment of the structures themselves would correspond to the direction of extension associated with the left-lateral strike-slip, whereas the NW oriented direction of compression would correspond to the fluid flow...|$|R
