2500|$|Assist {{features}} {{are often used}} to help balance asymmetry from non-telecentricity at different slit positions, due to different illumination angles, starting at the 7nm node. However, the asymmetry is reduced but not completely eliminated, since the assist features mainly enhance the highest spatial frequencies, whereas intermediate spatial frequencies, which also affect feature focus and position, are not much affected. The coupling between the primary image and the self images is too strong for the asymmetry to be completely eliminated by assist features; only asymmetric illumination can achieve this. Assist features may also {{get in the way}} of access to power/ground rails. Power rails are expected to be wider, which also limits the effectiveness of using assist features, by constraining the local pitch. Local pitches between 1x and 2x the minimum pitch forbid assist feature placement, as there is simply no room to preserve the local pitch symmetry. In fact, for the application to the two-bar asymmetry case, the optimum assist feature placement may be less than or exceed the two-bar pitch. Depending on the parameter to be optimized (process window area, depth of focus, <b>exposure</b> <b>latitude),</b> the optimum assist feature configuration can be very different, e.g., pitch between assist feature and bar being different from two-bar pitch, symmetric or asymmetric, etc..|$|E

A two-factorial model was derived and validated for the predictive analysis. The model structure highlighted the dependency of solar energy transmissivity on the collector <b>exposure</b> time and <b>latitude</b> angle of its location. ζ =- 0. 0021 θ- 5 x 10 - 6 ϑ + 0. 9081. The validity of the derived model was rooted on the core model expression ζ- 0. 9081 =- 0. 0021 θ- 5 x 10 - 6 ϑ where {{both sides of the}} expression are correspondingly approximately equal. Regression model was used to generate results of transmissivty, and its trend of distribution was compared with that from derived model as a way of verifying its validity relative to experimental results. The results of this verification translated into very close alignment of curves and significantly similar trend of data point’s distribution for experimental (ExD), derived model (MoD) and regression model-predicted (ReG) results. Evaluations from generated results indicated that transmissivity per unit exposure time of collector and latitude angle of its location as obtained from experiment, derived model & regression model were 1. 0545 x 10 - 5, 1. 0545 x 10 - 5 & 1. 0909 x 10 - 5 (day) - 1 and 0. 0040, 0. 0040 & 0. 0042 deg. - 1 respectively.

Amongst a sundry of functions, the thyroid gland {{plays a key role}} in metabolism and consequently, hypothyroidism {{has been a}} common diagnosis for a decrease in performance in sled dogs. Research has indicated that a variety of environmental factors influence thyroid hormone production, of which, light <b>exposure,</b> climate, <b>latitude,</b> exercise and season demonstrate pronounced effects. Sled dogs are exposed to many of these variables and often display thyroid hormone levels that are clinically below normal ranges. Approach: This study took a cross-latitudinal naturalistic approach in determining the effects of day length, time of day, season, climate and exercise on thyroid hormone function in sled dogs. In the process, appropriate reference ranges for racing sled dogs were established that correlate with other studies involving working dogs. Results: There was a clear indication that thyroid hormones play an integral role in thermoregulation and are greatly affected by environmental cues. Unexpectedly, sled dogs in the sub Arctic were not more prone to hypothyroidism but in fact, had higher levels of most thyroid hormones than dogs residing at lower latitudes. Conclusion: An evolutionary adaptation may account for up-regulation of thyroid function in times of environmental extremes. Consequently, the normal range for most thyroid hormones in sled dogs is lower than clinical standards...|$|R

Allergy is believed to vary by month of birth, but multinational studies taking into account latitude have not been conducted. Methods and Findings: A questionnaire was distributed in 54 centres to {{a representative sample of}} 20 - to 44 -y-old men and women mainly in Europe but also including regions in North Africa, India, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Data from 200, 682 participants were analyzed. The median prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 22 %, with a substantial variation across centres. Overall, allergic rhinitis decreased with geographical latitude, but there were many exceptions. No increase in prevalence during certain winters could be observed. Also, no altered risk by birth month was found, except borderline reduced risks in September and October. Effect estimates obtained by a multivariate analysis of total and specific IgE values in 18, 085 individuals also excluded major birth month effects and confirmed the independent effect of language grouping. Conclusion: Neither time point of first exposure to certain allergens nor early infections during winter months seems to be a major factor for adult allergy.

Specimens {{were collected in}} areas with limited access to attached macroalgae, suggesting a major dietary component of drift algae. Gut contents of 480 animals from 2 moderately wave exposed and 2 sheltered rocky shores in each of 2 regions: western Scotland (55 – 56 °N) and southwest England (50 °N), were analysed in 2 years (n = 30 per site per year). The abundance of microalgae, macroalgae and invertebrates within the guts was quantified using categorical abundance scales. Gut content composition was compared among regions and wave exposure conditions, showing that the diet of P. vulgata changes with both wave <b>exposure</b> and <b>latitude.</b> Microalgae were most abundant in limpet gut contents in animals from southwest sites, whilst leathery/corticated macroalgae were more prevalent and abundant in limpets from sheltered and northern sites. P. vulgata {{appears to have a}} more flexible diet than previously appreciated and these keystone grazers consume not only microalgae, but also large quantities of macroalgae and small invertebrates. To date, limpet grazing studies have focussed on their role in controlling recruitment of macroalgae by feeding on microscopic propagules and germlings.

Target {{of the study was to}} learn about the impact of resist parameters on practical resolution limits and to derive specific process and material change proposals. After resist model calibration for 90 nm design rules, process window, mask error enhancement factor, linearity, line end shortening etc. were investigated. The main influencing resist parameters were determined with two independent methodologies: Single-and multiparameter variation, which showed good agreement. Further, the sensitivity analysis was expanded to feature sizes down to 20 nm halfpitch. To decouple all optical influences from the resist, ideal rectangular aerial images were generated and used for simulation. The simulation reveals that an ArF resist might be capable of 40 nm resolution with sufficient <b>exposure</b> dose <b>latitude,</b> comparable to today's 90 nm design rule. On the other hand even optimized exposure tools can't provide such ideal rectangular aerial images and there is no commercial resist known today that shows a process window at 40 nm resolution today.

A total of 380 subjects were sampled to have their vitamin D status assessed using 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D).

A basic tendency for lactase persistence to increase from the southeast to the northwest across European populations has been noted, but such trends within countries have not been extensively studied.
