2500|$|The {{municipality}} of Alajuela {{is also a}} major tourist attraction. In {{the center of the}} city is a centuries-old cathedral with a plaza where mangoes regularly fall from the trees. Known as [...] "The City of Mangoes," [...] there is a mango festival each June. Next to the plaza, there is a museum dedicated to folk hero Juan Santamaría. This museum is located within the old Alajuela Prison building and as of 1999 encompasses the old city armory, both of which are buildings constructed on the second half of the 19th century.

50|$|Broward {{continued}} {{this military}} filibustering operation until President William McKinley {{declared war on}} Spain. Several times he was nearly caught and destroyed by Spanish gunboats. Aware of Broward's identity, the Spanish ambassador to the United States demanded that the American be stopped and his ship impounded. U.S. authorities tried to catch him, but Broward eluded them by loading The Three Friends {{under cover of darkness}} in secluded locations, hiding her behind larger ships as she left the St. Johns, and picking up Cubans and munitions from other ships at various points near the mouth of the river. Except when trying to evade capture, Broward never pretended not to be a <b>filibusterer.</b> He gained notoriety around the state for his daring deeds.|$|E
50|$|In 1781, when he {{returned}} from the imprisonment, his increasingly erratic behaviour allowed his opponents to declare him insane by the Permanent Council and King Stanisław August. A special commission was tasked with investigating his situation. The problem caused much controversy, as it was alleged that the investigators were influenced by various political motivations. The Sejm of 1782 was heavily preoccupied with this case. One of the primary issues was the relevance of the neminem captivabimus law, which had no provisions for mentally ill persons, and which guaranteed wide personal freedoms to Polish nobility. Amendment bills were submitted, but were met with opposition and <b>filibusterer,</b> preventing the Sejm from making much progress on any issues. Eventually, Sołtyk failed to reclaim his bishopric from the substitutes who administered it in his absence. Thus for the last years of his life his political influence and power significantly waned.|$|E

50|$|The first American {{vessels to}} serve against West Indies piracy were the schooners USS Enterprise, USS Nonsuch and USS Lynx with the gunboats No. 158 and No. 168 {{were among the}} vessels {{deployed}} between 1817 and 1822. All of these ships operated independently {{and there was no}} commander of the squadron until its official establishment. Many of the pirates in the period were Latin Americans and doubled as privateers. Revolution against Spain was widespread and both the rebel governments and the Spanish issued letters of marque. Often the privateers captured American merchantmen and attacked their crews which resulted in them being branded as pirates. In 1819 President James Monroe sent Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry to Venezuela with the frigate USS Constellation, the corvette USS John Adams and USS Nonsuch. The commodore's orders were to demand restitution for the capture of American merchant ships by Venezuelan privateers and to receive an assurance that the privateers would be restrained from attacking again. Perry was successful in completing his mission initially and a treaty was signed on August 11, though on his cruise back to the United States, he died of yellow fever at Trinidad which caused the agreement to fail. On December 22, 1817, USS John Adams forced the <b>filibusterer</b> Luis Aury to evacuate his base at Amelia Island, Florida. Later, John Adams was flagship of Commodore Biddle's squadron.|$|E
