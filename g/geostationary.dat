5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} <b>geostationary</b> satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During <b>geostationary</b> transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in <b>geostationary</b> orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. <b>Geostationary</b> satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} May 15, 2007 {{in the eastern}} Pacific, {{designated}} as the area east of 140°W, and on June 1, 2007 in the central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W, and lasted until November 30, 2007. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. The season began slowly; {{through the end of}} July, the seasonal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) was the third lowest since the <b>geostationary</b> satellite era began in the 1966 Pacific hurricane season. The inactivity continued through the next month, which was the third quietest August in terms of ACE since reliable records began in the basin during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. In June, Tropical Storm Barbara caused $55million (2007USD) in crop damage to southeastern Mexico from heavy precipitation. In August, Hurricane Flossie formed in the eastern Pacific and crossed into the central Pacific; the hurricane threatened Hawaii but caused little damage. In early September, Hurricane Henriette dropped heavy rainfall in southwest Mexico, which caused nine fatalities and $25million (2007USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. <b>Geostationary</b> satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geostationary</b> {{transfer}} orbit: An elliptic orbit {{where the}} perigee {{is at the}} altitude of a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a <b>geostationary</b> orbit.|$|E
25|$|Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in {{geosynchronous}} (not <b>geostationary)</b> Tundra orbits. Like the <b>geostationary</b> orbit, {{the tundra}} orbit has {{a period of}} 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the <b>geostationary</b> orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined {{with respect to the}} equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a <b>geostationary</b> orbit. This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses <b>geostationary</b> orbits.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{transfer}} variant <b>geostationary</b> satellite platform.|$|E
25|$|A <b>geostationary</b> {{satellite}} is {{of special}} interest in this context. Unlike other objects in the sky which rise and set, an object in a <b>geostationary</b> orbit appears motionless in the sky, apparently defying gravity. In fact, {{it is in a}} circular equatorial orbit with a period of one day.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage is}} that considerably less launch energy is needed to place a spacecraft into a Molniya orbit than into a <b>geostationary</b> orbit. Disadvantages are that, {{as opposed to a}} spacecraft in a <b>geostationary</b> orbit, the ground station needs a steerable antenna to track the spacecraft and that the spacecraft will pass the Van Allen radiation belt four times per day.|$|E
25|$|Clarke orbit: Another {{name for}} a <b>geostationary</b> orbit. Named after {{scientist}} and writer Arthur C. Clarke.|$|E
25|$|Sky Muster II (NBN-Co 1B) was {{launched}} on 5 October 2016, it will operate in <b>geostationary</b> orbit of 145° East.|$|E
25|$|The same orbits, with slight adjustments, {{were also}} used by some Soviet spy satellites, with the apogee point over the {{continental}} United States. Although <b>geostationary</b> orbits are useful for observing the continental United States, Soviet sensor technology sometimes required high-contrast observing angles which could only be achieved from higher latitudes. One such example is the US-K early-warning satellite which watches for US missile launches, although improvements in these systems have since allowed them to move these to <b>geostationary</b> orbits.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of locating a space power station in <b>geostationary</b> orbit {{is that the}} antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available {{as soon as the}} first space power station is placed in orbit; other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power. A collection of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO (<b>Geostationary</b> Orbit) space-based solar power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geostationary</b> orbit (GEO): A {{geosynchronous}} orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer {{on the ground}} this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was launched}} on February 8, 1985, by an Ariane model rocket from the Kourou launch base in French Guiana {{and placed in}} a <b>geostationary</b> orbit over Brazilian territory.|$|E
25|$|International shortwave was in turn largely {{supplanted by}} {{communications}} satellites, especially for distributing network {{radio and television}} programming. In 1975, the company formed RCA American Communications, which operated its Satcom series of <b>geostationary</b> communications satellites.|$|E
25|$|On June 8, 2006, Space Systems/Loral {{announced}} that it was awarded a contract for the fifth Sirius spacecraft. The new spacecraft features a nine-meter unfurlable reflector. The first four Sirius spacecraft used more traditional parabolic reflectors. The new satellite has been designed for <b>geostationary</b> orbit, unlike the other satellites in the constellation; the different orbit has the stated purpose of allowing for more consistent reception for fixed location users (many subscribers have reported having to regularly reposition their antennas for optimal reception). Radiosat 5 (FM-5) is in a <b>geostationary</b> orbit at 96 degrees west. It was launched June 30, 2009, and announced to be in service as of September 9, 2009.|$|E
25|$|The first payload {{launched}} with a Delta IV was the Eutelsat W5 communications satellite. The {{launch vehicle}} was a Medium+ (4,2) variant, launched from Cape Canaveral. It carried the communications satellite into <b>geostationary</b> transfer orbit (GTO) on November 20, 2002.|$|E
25|$|In a 1945 Wireless World article, the English {{science fiction}} writer Arthur C. Clarke (1917–2008) {{described}} in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications. He suggested that three <b>geostationary</b> satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.|$|E
25|$|Higher orbits include medium Earth orbit (MEO), {{sometimes}} called {{intermediate circular orbit}} (ICO), and further above, <b>geostationary</b> orbit (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the launch}} of MEASAT-1 and MEASAT-2 in 1996, the company has {{expanded}} its fleet to across six (6) <b>geostationary</b> satellites designed and built by Boeing Satellite Systems, Orbital Sciences Corporation, Loral Space & Communications, and Airbus Defence and Space.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcasting}} satellites are <b>geostationary,</b> {{which causes}} them {{to be less than}} 10° above the horizon for locations north of 71.4° latitude. This means aircraft in areas of Alaska or northern Canada may have difficulty maintaining a lock on the WAAS signal.|$|E
25|$|NBN Co had {{contracted}} Space Systems/Loral {{to build and}} launch two <b>geostationary</b> Ka band satellites in 2015 at a total cost of , each offering eighty gigabits per second of bandwidth. The first satellite called Sky Muster (NBN-Co 1A) was launched on 1 October 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is designed}} to mitigate and retain signal quality in hostile signal conditions and the relatively weak signal levels from distant satellites. Because the satellites are not all <b>geostationary</b> they appear and disappear over the horizon. Terrestrial signals are present only in major cities to augment the satellite signals.|$|E
25|$|On October 14, 2010, the XM-5 {{satellite}} {{was launched}} aboard an International Launch Services (ILS) Proton vehicle. It was placed into <b>geostationary</b> orbit at 85.2 degrees west {{to serve the}} eastern half of the United States. The satellite was manufactured by Space Systems/Loral and was fully operational on December 3, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) {{calls this}} type of system a satellite-based {{augmentation}} system (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs, the Indian GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN), the European <b>Geostationary</b> Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), respectively. Commercial systems include StarFire and OmniSTAR.|$|E
25|$|ISRO on 1 July 2013, at 23:41 IST {{launched}} from Sriharikota the First Indian Navigation Satellite the IRNSS-1A. The IRNSS-1A was launched aboard PSLV-C22. The constellation would be comprising 7 satellites of I-1K bus each weighing around 1450 Kilogrammes, with three satellites in the <b>Geostationary</b> Earth Orbit (GEO) and 4 in Geosynchronous earth orbit(GSO). The constellation would be completed around April 2016.|$|E
25|$|Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) is {{used for}} Falcon 9 {{launches}} to low Earth and <b>geostationary</b> orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches, or polar launches. As part of SpaceX's booster reusability program, the former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zone 1, has been designated for use for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.|$|E
25|$|Satellites {{are used}} for many purposes. Common types include {{military}} and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on {{the purpose of the}} satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and <b>geostationary</b> orbit.|$|E
25|$|The first GAGAN {{navigation}} payload {{has been}} fabricated {{and it was}} proposed to be flown on GSAT-4 during Apr 2010. However, GSAT-4 was not placed in orbit as GSLV-D3 could not complete the mission. Two more GAGAN payloads will be subsequently flown, one each on two <b>geostationary</b> satellites, GSAT-8 and GSAT-10. On 12 May 2012, ISRO announced the successful testing of its indigenous cryogenic engine for 200 seconds for its forthcoming GSLV-D5 flight.|$|E
25|$|ISRO {{has also}} {{launched}} {{a set of}} experimental <b>geostationary</b> satellites known as the GSAT series. Kalpana-1, ISRO's first dedicated meteorological satellite, was launched by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on 12 September 2002. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. In February 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla – a NASA astronaut of Indian origin who perished in Space Shuttle Columbia.|$|E
25|$|During {{the six-day}} mission, January 12–18, Cenker {{performed}} {{a variety of}} physiological tests, operated a primary experiment – an infrared imaging camera – and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom's Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective. Satcom K-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its <b>geostationary</b> “slot” at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the space shuttle program.|$|E
25|$|INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) is {{a series}} of {{multipurpose}} <b>geostationary</b> satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology and search-and-rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is a joint venture of the Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, India Meteorological Department, All India Radio and Doordarshan. The overall co-ordination and management of INSAT system rests with the Secretary-level INSAT Coordination Committee.|$|E
25|$|BSAT-1a was a <b>geostationary</b> {{communications}} satellite designed and manufactured by Hughes (now Boeing) on the HS-376 platform. It was originally ordered {{and operated by}} the Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation (B-SAT). It {{was used as the}} main satellite to broadcast television channels for NHK and WOWOW over Japan. It had a pure Ku band payload and operated on the 110°E longitude until it was replaced, along its backup BSAT-1b, by BSAT-3a. On 3 August 2010, it was decommissioned and placed on a graveyard orbit.|$|E
