30|$|Comparing with noodles, few {{researches}} on the hydrocolloids application in CSB were reported so far. Sim et al. [30] {{found that when}} wheat flour was blended with 0.2 % sodium alginates and 0.8 % <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> to prepare CSB, the quality evaluation in terms of spread ratio, specific volume and staling behavior indicated that, at 0.2 % addition level sodium alginates is better than <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> in delaying staling of CSB though the slight reduction in spread ratio and specific volume were evident, at 0.8 % level, however, <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> seems {{to be better than}} sodium alginates in enhancing CSB properties. Liu et al. [75] investigated the effects of hydrocolloids (HPMC, CMC, XG, and AP) at different concentrations on the quality of gluten-free potato-steamed bread. The results showed that steamed breads with hydrocolloids presented higher specific volume and lower hardness, and the rapidly digestible starch and estimated glycemic index significantly decreased from 45.51 to 20.64 and from 69.54 to 55.17, respectively. They suggested that HPMC and XG could be used as improvers in the gluten-free potato-steamed bread.|$|E
30|$|To {{select the}} optimum {{thickening}} agent for fresh noodle making, five kinds of hydrocolloids, CMC, sodium alginates, xanthan gum, guar gum and <b>konjac</b> <b>gum,</b> were {{incorporated in the}} making of fresh noodle at different concentrations [80]. The results indicated that overall quality of noodle was improved by the addition of all the five gums. The overall quality score increased to the maximum and then decreased with the quantity increasing of hydrocolloids. It is notable that the optimum concentration of hydrocolloids appeared between 0.3 and 0.4 %, and the performances of xanthan gum and <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> were much better than that of the other three hydrocolloids.|$|E
30|$|Apart from alginates, other hydrocolloids, such as CMC, carrageenan, xanthan, guar gum, pectin, <b>konjac</b> <b>gum,</b> {{artemisia}} sphaerocephala krasch gum, edible gelatin {{and some}} modified starches, usually play a similar role as alginates {{in improving the}} overall quality of fresh noodles, dry noodle or CSB. However, variations on detailed performance among these hydrocolloids were observed as reflected by the specific quality indicator.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the suitability of hydrophilic natural <b>gums,</b> namely - <b>konjac</b> glucomannan <b>gum</b> (KG), Tara gallactomannan gum (TG) andxanthan gum (XG); and their combination, as bioadhesive polymers. Materials and Methods: Bioadhesive strength of the gums and their combination was investigated using texture analyzer employing chicken pouch as biological membrane. Results: It was observed that the bioadhesive strength was enhanced by the increase in contact time between the tablets under test and biological membrane. Different gums and their combination produced significantly different bioadhesive strength, and were ranked in the order of: XG > KG 40 H > KG 40 H + XG > KG 32 H > KG 32 H + XG + TG > KG 32 H + XG > XG + TG > KG 40 H + XG + TG. Conclusions: From these preliminary studies, it can be concluded that KG and XG are capable to be employed as bioadhesive polymers in drug delivery systems and chicken pouch an easily available, having uniform surface thus producing reproducible results, can be used as model mucosa...|$|R

40|$|Copra {{and other}} mannans {{including}} locust bean <b>gum,</b> guar <b>gum,</b> <b>konjac</b> flour, copra and defatted copra {{were used to}} produce extracellular mannanase by shaken flask cultures of Aspergillus niger NCH- 189 in this study. The best carbon source for mannanase production was defatted copra, which provided more nitrogen source and mannan content. The peak mannanase activity at 28 U ml(- 1) was obtained on the day 3 at 30 degreesC, which was four times of those obtained from other carbon sources. Presence of oil in copra depressed the mannanase production of the fungus and the amount should be less than 3 % (w/w). The copra suspension could be sequentially treated by boiling and refrigeration, followed by using n-hexane to remove copra oil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All riahts reserved...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A host runs {{less risk}} of {{contracting}} a gastrointestinal infection when enteropathogenic bacteria adhere to dietary fibers {{instead of to}} epithelial cell receptors. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the binding capacity of food and feed components for intestinal bacteria from various hosts using a miniaturized in vitro assay. In total, 18 dietary components were tested with four strains of E. coli, seven strains of Salmonella enterica and two strains of Lactobacillus. RESULTS: A comparison of the results obtained for all Salmonella strains tested revealed that <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> and sesame seed extract represented the most efficient binding matrices. Similarly, for all E. coli strains tested, sesame seed extract and artichoke performed well as binding matrices. Salmonella isolates from chickens adhered best to sesame seed extract. E. coli K 88 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium isolated from pigs effectively bound to Bia-Mos (R), pumpkin, sesame seed extract, and tomato. Sesame seed extract and tomato also had adhesive capacities for E. coli K 99, S. enterica sv. Dublin, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium from calves. With human isolates, <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> showed a high binding potential for S. enterica and E. coli. CONCLUSION: The adhesion screening of different food and feed components resulted in highly discriminating product rankings. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
30|$|Becker and Galetti (2008) {{investigated}} various {{food and}} feed components for alternative adhesion of intestinal E. coli and Salmonella. Yeast mannan-oligosaccharides, pumpkin, sesame seed extract, palm kernel extract and <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> were among the strongest binding matrices for enteropathogens. Adhesion matrices differ tremendously which gives rise to various interpretations and speculations on substantial binding factors while suggesting that unspecific and unknown binding properties are involved. Moreover, {{taking into account the}} diversity of natural products and biological variation therein, the binding capacity of fibrous {{food and feed}} components for different bacteria seems rather unpredictable (Becker and Galetti, 2008).|$|E
40|$|The {{flotation}} and adsorption {{of a new}} polysaccharide <b>konjac</b> <b>gum</b> (KG) on pyrite and talc in {{the presence}} of pre-adsorbed potassium butyl xanthate (PBX) is investigated. The micro-flotation results show that KG is a quality depressant for talc and that conditioning the minerals initially with PBX before KG will increase the recovery difference between pyrite and talc. The results of artificially mixing the minerals show that compared with adding KG before PBX, when minerals are pre-adsorbed with PBX, the grade and the recovery of sulfur (S) increases by 1. 96 % and 5. 44 %, respectively. The contact angle results show that the addition of PBX before KG will increase the contact angles of pyrite, but the addition order of KG/PBX has little influence on the contact angles of talc. The adsorption tests show that KG can adsorb on pyrite and talc surfaces, while PBX can only adsorb on the pyrite surface. The addition order of KG/PBX affects the adsorption of KG and PBX on the pyrite surface but not on the talc surface. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis further demonstrates the chemical adsorption of KG on pyrite and talc surfaces, while PBX chemisorbs on the pyrite surface. Based on these analyses, a schematic illustration of the reagent adsorption forms on pyrite and talc surfaces is drawn to explain the competitive adsorption of KG and PBX on mineral surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Retrograded starch (RS 3 ) was {{produced}} from indica rice starch with {{three kinds of}} <b>gums</b> (<b>konjac</b> glucomannan, KGM; carrageenan, CA, USA; and gellan, GA, USA) by autoclaving, respectively, {{and the effect of}} the gums on the retrogradation behavior of starch was estimated. The influences of polysaccharide concentration, sodium chloride concentration, autoclaving time, refrigerated time, and pH value on RS 3 formation were discussed. Except for sodium chloride’s persistent restraint on RS 3 , the others all forced RS 3 yields higher at first, but lowered it after the peak value. The influencing sequence of these impact factors was: sodium chloride concentration > polysaccharide concentration > autoclaving time > refrigerated time > pH value. The results also proved that in the three gums, KGM plays the most significant role in RS 3 changing. It was concluded that the incorporation of each of these three gums into starch, especially KGM, results in an increase or decrease of RS 3 under different conditions. This phenomenon could be taken into consideration when developing starchy food with appropriate amount of RS 3 ...|$|R
40|$|Incorporating {{high volume}} {{fractions}} of broccoli powder in starch noodle dough {{has a major}} effect on its shear modulus, {{as a result of}} significant swelling of the broccoli particles. Several hydrocolloids with distinct water binding capacity (locust bean gum (LBG), guar <b>gum,</b> <b>konjac</b> glucomannan (KG), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum), were added to systems with 4 and 20 % (v/v dry based) broccoli particles, and the effect of this addition on dough rheology, mechanical properties and structure of cooked noodles was investigated. Hydrocolloids with low (LBG and guar gum) and intermediate (KG) water binding capacity had no significant effect on shear rheology of the dough. Adding hydrocolloids with high water binding capacity (HPMC and xanthan gum) decreased the shear modulus of dough with 20 % broccoli particles significantly. CLSM analysis of cooked noodles showed that in samples containing xanthan gum there was also an inhibition of swelling of starch granules. Strength and stiffness of cooked noodles with 20 % broccoli particles were higher for samples containing xanthan gum, than samples without xanthan gum. The cooking loss and swelling index of samples with added hydrocolloids were slightly lower than samples without hydrocolloids. Our results showed that hydrocolloids with high water binding capacity can be used to control the degree of swelling of vegetable particles and starch granules in starch noodle products, and thereby control both dough rheology and textural properties of the cooked noodle...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on alginate-konjac- xanthan polysaccharide complex (PGX) as a novel food (NF) submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97. The NF is an off-white granular powder composed of three non- starch polysaccharides: <b>konjac</b> glucomannan, xanthan <b>gum</b> and sodium alginate. The information provided on the composition, the specifications, the batch-to-batch variability and {{the stability of the}} NF is sufficient and does not raise safety concerns. The production process is sufficiently described and does not raise concerns about the safety of the NF. The applicant intends to add the NF to a variety of foods as well as to market the NF in capsules. The recommended maximum daily intake of the NF from fortified foods and food supplements is 15 g. The target population proposed by the applicant is adults from 18 to 64 years of age. Considering the no observed adverse effect level of 1. 8 g/kg body weight (bw) per day in a subchronic toxicity study with PGX and the highest mean and 95 th percentile anticipated daily intake of NF from fortified foods, the margin of exposure (MoE) is 12 and 6, respectively, whereas the MoE for the NF from food supplements is 9. The Panel concludes that the safety of the novel food, PGX, for the intended uses and use levels as proposed by the applicant, has not been established.
