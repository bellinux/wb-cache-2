50|$|High-occupancy toll <b>lanes</b> (<b>HOT</b> <b>lanes)</b> are toll lanes {{operating}} alongside existing highway lanes. They provided {{drivers with}} a {{faster and more}} reliable travel option. Buses, carpools, motorcycles and emergency vehicles {{will be able to}} use the <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> for free while drivers with fewer than three occupants can use the <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> by paying a toll. The <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> will use dynamic or congestion pricing to manage the number vehicles, and to keep them free-flowing. On average, vehicles are expected to be traveling 55 miles per hour, even during peak travel times.|$|R
50|$|WSDOT is {{implementing}} a high occupancy toll <b>lanes</b> (<b>HOT</b> <b>lanes)</b> program on Interstate 405, the main bypass around Seattle. The {{first section of}} <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes,</b> between Bellevue and Lynnwood, opened on September 27, 2015, and included {{the construction of an}} auxiliary lane between Bothell and Bellevue. WSDOT proposes a 40 mi system of <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> on the entire length of I-405 and nearby SR 167, with the southern half from Bellevue to Renton scheduled to be completed in 2024. A direct flyover ramp in Renton between the <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> on I-405 and SR 167 began construction in 2016.|$|R

50|$|Caliper Corporation has {{developed}} a TransModeler traffic simulation of the High-occupancy toll <b>lanes</b> (<b>HOT)</b> <b>lanes</b> on the Capital Beltway (I-495) in Virginia with Transurban, a leading toll road owner and operator in Australia and North America. The Capital Beltway <b>HOT</b> <b>Lanes</b> project is a nearly two billion dollar public-private partnership that {{is intended to be}} an innovative solution to traffic congestion through dynamic, open-road tolling. Sensors will monitor traffic levels continuously, and a tolling algorithm designed to maintain a target level of service in the <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> will adjust the price dynamically. Drivers who choose to use the <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> will pay a toll conveyed to them via dynamic message signs.

50|$|A common {{variant of}} ETLs are high-occupancy toll (<b>HOT)</b> <b>lanes.</b> <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> are free for high-occupancy {{vehicles}}, while vehicles with fewer passengers pay a toll. Some types of vehicles may {{be exempt from}} tolls, such as hybrid vehicles (including single-occupant hybrid vehicles in <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes),</b> registered carpools (on ETLs), and motorcycles. Some toll managed lanes may only be tolled at certain times or charge different rates for high-occupancy vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In May 2008, {{a single}} <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> in each {{direction}} runs along 9 mi of State Route 167 between Renton and Auburn in King County. Carpools of two people or more, transit, vanpools and motorcycles may still use the HOT as a regular HOV lane free of the HOT toll. If vehicles with the Good to Go Pass have two or more occupants, the pass must be covered up by a shield or their account will be deducted for the toll. The pilot project was extended through June 2013 by the state legislature in 2011. The <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> was extended 3.5 mi south to Algona in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{call for}} three phases of construction. Upon final completion, the freeway will have five lanes in each direction, {{including}} a high-occupancy/toll (<b>HOT)</b> <b>lane.</b> Some sections will also include two lane frontage roads {{on both sides}} of the freeway.|$|E
50|$|However, traffic {{using the}} interchange's left-side {{connectors}} between the I-105 carpool (HOV) lanes and the I-110 Metro ExpressLanes (high-occupancy toll (<b>HOT)</b> <b>lanes)</b> is more restricted.

50|$|At {{the north}} and south {{terminal}} of the HOT lanes, motorists will be able to transition directly between the HOT lanes and the I-495 general purpose lanes. However, elsewhere along the corridor, access to and from the HOT lanes will be only from cross roads. Some cross roads will provide access to both HOT lanes and general purpose lanes; others will have access only to one system or the other. Many <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> access points will serve traffic in only one direction of I-495, which is intended to complement typical commuting patterns. <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> interchanges are as follows:The original scope of the HOT project is covered by a fixed-price $1.3 billion contract between concessionaire Capital Beltway Express LLC and contractor Fluor-Lane LLC.

40|$|Economists {{have long}} {{advocated}} congestion pricing as an efficient way of allocating scarce roadway capacity. However, {{with a few}} exceptions, congestion tolls are rarely used in practice and strongly opposed by the public and elected officials. Although high implementation costs and privacy issues are alleviated as appropriate technologies are developed, the concerns that congestion pricing will adversely affect low-income travelers remain. In this paper, we use a strategic transportation planning model calibrated for the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to compare the welfare and distributional effects of three pricing schemes: value pricing (<b>HOT</b> <b>lanes),</b> limited congestion pricing, and comprehensive congestion pricing. We find that social welfare gains from <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> amount to three-quarters of those from the comprehensive road pricing. At the same time, a <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes</b> policy {{turns out to be}} much more equitable than other road pricing schemes, with all income groups strictly benefiting even before the toll revenue is recycled. traffic congestion, congestion pricing, value pricing, <b>HOT</b> <b>lanes,</b> HOV lanes...|$|R
50|$|A high-occupancy {{toll lane}} (or <b>HOT</b> <b>lane)</b> {{is a type}} of traffic lane or roadway that is {{available}} to high-occupancy vehicles and other exempt vehicles without charge; other vehicles are required to pay a variable fee that is adjusted in response to demand. Unlike toll roads, drivers have an option to use general purpose lanes, on which a fee is not charged. Express toll lanes, which are less common, operate along similar lines, but do not exempt high-occupancy vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A {{branching}} route {{system is}} employed, with {{the backbone of}} the system being the HOT lanes along U.S. Route 36. High-occupancy vehicles and buses travel free in the HOT lanes, while single-occupancy vehicles must pay between $1.25 to $7.60, depending on time of day, or up to $13.68 without an electronic toll collection pass. The <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> will be managed to ensure that traffic will flow at 50 to 55 miles per hour. Union Station and Civic Center in Denver and Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora serve as the southern termini, while Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction are the northern termini.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in July 2012, the Colorado Department of Transportation built a high-occupancy {{toll lane}} (<b>HOT</b> <b>lane)</b> in each {{direction}} between Federal Boulevard and 88th Street in Louisville, Colorado. Phase 1 of the project, costing $497 million, will open in summer 2015. High-occupancy vehicles and buses like RTD's Flatiron Flyer travel free in the HOT lanes, while single-occupancy vehicles must pay between $1.25 to $7.60, depending on time of day, or up to $13.68 without an electronic toll collection pass. To accommodate the lanes, several bridges were replaced and shoulders were widened along the highway. Phase 2 of the project, anticipated to be complete by early 2016, will extend the HOT lanes from 88th Street to Table Mesa Drive in Boulder, Colorado through a public-private partnership.|$|E

This is {{in addition to the}} investment in the I-15 <b>HOT</b> <b>lane</b> project, which cost approximately $1 billion for four new lanes and direct access ramps. While an extension of the San Diego Trolley was studied, low ridership, hilly terrain and high cost estimates stopped the rail idea from proceeding.
