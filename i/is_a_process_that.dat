5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet {{has been found to}} have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> modifies {{a smooth}} {{curve in the}} Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of}} a geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

25|$|Desalination <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> {{extracts}} mineral components from saline water. More generally, desalination {{refers to}} the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance, as in soil desalination, which is an issue for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Design and {{construction}} are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing {{of the members}} and their connections should {{be as simple as}} possible.

25|$|Kendoka {{who wish}} to use such {{techniques}} during practice or competitions, often practice each technique with a motodachi. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> requires patience.

25|$|Intervalence charge {{transfer}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> produces a strong colored appearance {{at a low}} percentage of impurity.

25|$|Ductility is a material's {{ability to}} deform under tensile stress. This is often {{characterized}} by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Ductility is especially important in metalworking because materials that crack or break under stress cannot be hammered, rolled, or drawn (drawing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> uses tensile forces to stretch metal).|$|E

25|$|A {{port scan}} or portscan <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> sends client {{requests}} {{to a range}} of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port; this is not a nefarious process in and of itself. The majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks, but rather simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine.|$|E
25|$|Acclimation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is {{performed}} when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation. This process slowly introduces the organisms {{to the water}} composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry.

25|$|Homogenization <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> {{reduces the}} size of fat {{globules}} by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> {{leads to the}} transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, {{chemical reaction}}s encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.|$|E
25|$|All lens {{constants}} are estimates, {{to begin}} with. To obtain {{the best possible}} results, {{it is imperative that}} these constants be optimized. Optimization <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is user-specific and incorporates the various systematic errors attributable to measurement of ocular parameters. In order to optimize a lens-constant, the user must back calculate the formula so that the actual post-operative refractive error is included. This means that one must calculate the constant so that a recalculation of the formula would predict exactly the same refractive error as actually observed.|$|E
