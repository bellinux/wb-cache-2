[...] "Return of the Phantom Stranger" [...] features the quote [...] "she lays there, waiting for the sacrifice" [...] from the film The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973). Hellbilly Deluxe closes with the final song, [...] "The Beginning of the End". The song is an instrumental track, described as [...] "spastic" [...] and is said to [...] "suggest even more bizarre things are yet to come." [...] The track features the sound of industrial machine factory like noise layered over the music.|$|E
2500|$|However, legends {{surrounding}} Saint Francis of Assisi {{show him}} befriending a wolf. According to the Fioretti, {{the city of}} Gubbio was besieged by the Wolf of Gubbio, which devoured both livestock and men. Francis of Assisi, who was living in Gubbio at the time took pity on the townsfolk, and went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, but the saint pressed on and when he found the wolf he {{made the sign of}} the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at the feet of St. Francis. [...] "Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil ..." [...] said Francis. [...] "All these people accuse you and curse you… But brother wolf, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace between you and the people."

In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis, ever the lover of animals, even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again.|$|E
