5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (<b>food-grade</b> <b>salt</b> is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

However, salt is also a source of living bacteria and archaea. The occurrence and diversity of viable archaea in this extreme environment were assessed in 26 food-grade salts from worldwide origin by cultivation on four culture media. Additionally, metagenomic analysis of 16 S rRNA gene was performed on nine salts. Viable archaea were observed in 14 salts and colony counts reached more than 10 (5) CFU per gram in three salts. All archaeal isolates identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing belonged to the Halobacteriaceae family and were related to 17 distinct genera among which Haloarcula, Halobacterium and Halorubrum were the most represented. High-throughput sequencing generated extremely different profiles for each salt. Four of them contained a single major genus (Halorubrum, Halonotius or Haloarcula) while the others had three or more genera of similar occurrence. The number of distinct genera per salt ranged from 21 to 27. Halorubrum had a significant contribution to the archaeal diversity in seven salts; this correlates with its frequent occurrence in crystallization ponds.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{executed}} {{to investigate the}} effects of drinking deep sea water treated by reverse osmosis process (RO-DSW) on growth performance, nutrient utilizability, relative weight of lymphoid organs and the concentration of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in broiler chickens. A total of 200 one day old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were equally and randomly distributed into 10 ground floor pens (20 chicks per pen, 5 pens per treatment) bedded with rice-husks. The broilers were offered either fresh tap water (Control) or RO-DSW for 28 days (from d 6 to d 33) as the drinking water. The same basal phase 1 diet for first 2 weeks and phase 2 diet for last 2 weeks were offered ad libitum to the birds. The RO-DSW was prepared by diluting 1 : 20 ratio with deionized water before offering to chickens. The diet for control birds was supplemented with 0. 21 % of <b>food-grade</b> <b>salt</b> to satisfy salt need of the birds. Broiler feeding study resulted {{that there were no}} differences in amount of water consumption, mortality and FCR between RO-DSW and control chickens. However, feed intake and body weight gain were increased (p 0. 05) difference in nutrients utilizability between RO-DSW and fresh water drinking. There were no (p> 0. 05) differences in the immune response between the control and treatment group. The serum IgG levels were 3. 01 vs 2. 87 mg/ml and the relative weights of spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius were 0. 23, 0. 18 and 0. 20 vs. 0. 20, 0. 17 and 0. 14 for RO-DSW vs. control birds, respectively. The immune responses were tended to be improved by RO-DSW drinking. This study showed an improvement in weight gain and feed intake that could be induced by RO-DSW drinking, although it i...|$|E

Currently, this wastewater is treated as a residue not being further valorized. However, the presence of a significant amount of valuable compounds in this rest, such as amino acids and proteins, may allow for valorization opportunities not yet explored. The present work focuses on the identification of the nitrogen-containing compounds present in such wastewater. Total nitrogen (WSN), trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen (TCASN) and phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen (PTASN) were evaluated by the micro-Kjeldahl method; Biuret method was used for total protein determinations and SDS-Page was performed for protein molecular weight screening.

40|$|Seawater {{desalination}} {{is becoming}} {{an important source of}} fresh water in several countries all around the world. One of the main drawbacks of desalination processes, however, is related to the disposal of large quantities of concentrated brine, which is an always-present by-product of the process. An integrated production of fresh water and salts may be achieved using the discharge brine from a desalination plant as a feed for conventional salt ponds, with the advantages of using brine more concentrated than sea water and, in the case of thermal desalination plants, warmer than sea water. By doing so, the process is faster {{as a consequence of the}} enhancement of evaporation rate on the surface of ponds. The above concept has been proposed already several years ago, but only rare examples exist of real applications. A pilot test has been performed in the last 4 years in Trapani (Italy), where a 36, 000 -m 3 /d multiple effects desalination with thermal vapour compression plant is operating very close to a traditional salt pond normally fed with sea water. Furthermore, the use of fractionated crystallisation process, typically adopted in conventional salt ponds, allows for the easy separation of salts like calcium carbonates and sulphates, sodium chloride and a final saturated brine which is extremely rich in magnesium as a sole bivalent cation. Thus, the possibility of a further exploitation of such saturated brine has been experimentally analysed by laboratory tests in order to produce high-purity magnesium to be commercialised in the pharmaceutical, food and metal industries. Results have shown a very promising enhancement of the salt pond production capacity, keeping at the same time the very high quality standards required for the production of <b>food-grade</b> <b>salt</b> from sea water. On the other side, laboratory experiments indicated the actual possibility of producing high-purity magnesium salts, thus encouraging towards further investigation for the development of a pilot process development and installation. © 2012 Desalination Publications.

40|$|Introduction Salting {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} means of food preservation: adding salt {{decreases}} water activity and inhibits microbial development. Worldwide production of salt is led by China (24 %), Europe (21 %) and USA (17 %). Applications for food and feed represent 3 % of the European consumption. Salted and fermented food products often contain halophilic archaea. The presence of Halorubrum and Halosarcina species has been reported in brines during fermentation of table olives [1]. Histamine-degrading archaea belonging to genera Halobacterium and Natrinema were reported in salted-fermented fishery products and Haloarcula marismortui was isolated from salted anchovies [2] [3]. Kimchi, a Korean fermented food, was shown to maintain archaeal population of the Natronococcus, Natrialba, Halosimplex, Halobiforma and Halococcus genera [4]. The salt itself has proven to contain viable microbial cells [5]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the occurrence and diversity of archaea in food-grade salts. Material and methods The archaeal diversity of twenty-six commercial food-grade salts from worldwide origin was assessed by culture on solid media (MGM, Hv-YPC, DBCM 2 and CDM with pyruvate). Colony forming units (CFU) were counted and phenotypically distinct isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing was performed on nine of these salts. Results Viable archaea were observed in 14 salts and colony counts reached more than 105 CFU per gram in three salts. All archaeal isolates identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing belonged to the Halobacteriaceae family and were related to 16 distinct genera among which Haloarcula, Halobacterium, Halarchaeum and Halorubrum were the most represented. High-throughput sequencing generated extremely different profiles for each salt. Four of them contained a single major genus (Halorubrum, Halonotius or Haloarcula) while the others had three or more genera of similar occurrence. The number of distinct genera per salt ranged from 21 to 27. Discussion Halorubrum had a significant contribution to the archaeal diversity in seven salts; this correlates with its frequent occurrence in crystallization ponds. On the contrary, Haloquadratum walsbyi, the halophilic archaea most commonly found in solar salterns, was a minor actor of the <b>food-grade</b> <b>salt</b> diversity. This supports the hypothesis that the crystallization process modifies the archaeal diversity, possibly due to distinct survival capabilities in extremely low water activity environments. Although not primarily sought, halophilic bacteria were also recovered from four food-grade salts. They were isolated from the richest substrate media MGM and Hv-YPC. The latter not only supported the growth of halophilic bacteria, but also impeded archaeal development. The surprisingly high content of viable archaea in popular food-grade salts frequently used in food preparation raises the question of their fate after ingestion. Therefore, their survival and potential activity in human intestinal tract should now be considered and further investigated. References 1. Abriouel H. et al. (2011).
