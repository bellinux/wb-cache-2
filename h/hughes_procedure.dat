Background: The modified <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to reconstruct large full-thickness lower eyelid defects. Meanwhile, the functional results indicated that ocular surface health in the treated eyes may be affected. Patients and methods: Noncomparative, case series retrospective study was designed after obtaining the approval of the institutional review board at the Ophthalmology Department, Menoufia University, Egypt, where the results of cases who underwent surgery with the modified <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure</b> during a 7 -year interval were evaluated. Results: Eleven patients (seven males and four females) in the age range 59 – 77  years (mean age 67 ± 5  years) were identified. The follow-up ranged from 12  months to 48  months. Cosmetic, functional, and postoperative results were analyzed. Conclusion: Despite the favorable cosmetic results of the Hughes tarsoconjunctival flap, the procedure has its own limitations. The results indicated that it does affect the functions and tear film stability in the treated eyes.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the management of}} lower eyelid margin hypertrophy as a complication of the <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure</b> for eyelid reconstruction. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients with lower eyelid hypertrophy after <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure.</b> Patient demographics, management, histologic findings, and outcomes were recorded. The patients underwent wedge excision of the hypertrophic segment of the eyelid with direct closure achieved {{in the majority of}} cases. Results: Five patients were identified. The mean age at presentation was 66 years. The mean onset for the hypertrophic margin was 8. 4 weeks after the Hughes flap. Four patients complained of ocular irritation and 1 patient had a constant ocular discharge. All patients were concerned by the appearance of the eyelid margin. Four patients received topical steroid treatment and 4 patients underwent triamcinolone subcutaneous injections with no improvement. The wedge excision was successful in 4 patients at the mean follow-up of 10 months, with no recurrence of the hypertrophic margin. One patient was reviewed in another center. Conclusion: The authors found no beneficial effect with topical or subcutaneous courses of steroids on eyelid margin hypertrophy. In situations of horizontal eyelid laxity, a fullthickness wedge excision offers a good means of removing the offending eyelid segment. Susie T. Luu, Paul S. Cannon and Dinesh Selv...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Repair {{of large}} defects {{of the lower}} eyelid can be difficult. A common {{procedure}} performed to address these defects is a Hughes flap. This procedure {{has a number of}} disadvantages: The eye is closed postoperatively, a second stage is required, and the edge of the flap is often erythematous. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a one-stage procedure for the repair of large full-thickness defects of the lower lid as an alternative to a Hughes flap. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent the described procedure. The procedure employs lateral stabilization of the posterior lamella with a periosteal strip, medial transposition of the lateral posterior lamella for central and medial defects, and a myocutaneous advancement flap to stabilize the anterior lamella. Results: A total of 38 patients underwent the procedure to reconstruct full-thickness defects of the lower lid ranging from 50 % to 75 %. All patients underwent previous Mohs excision of a skin cancer. The average follow-up was 5. 6 months. Eleven patients (29 %) had postoperative sequelae, but only two patients (5 %) required additional treatment. Conclusion: Lateral stabilization with a periosteal strip and myocutaneous advancement flap is an excellent one-step procedure that avoids many of the complications seen with the <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure</b> and is comparable to other techniques used for the reconstruction of subtotal, full-thickness lower lid defects...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{modified}} <b>Hughes</b> <b>procedure</b> is used {{to reconstruct}} full-thickness lower eyelid defects. A tarsoconjunctival flap from the upper eyelid replaces the posterior lamella, whereas a skin graft, a skin flap, or a skin-muscle flap restores the anterior lamella. The conjunctival pedicle from the upper eyelid is divided after vascularization of the reconstructed lower eyelid is judged to be adequate (traditionally, at least 3 weeks postoperatively). This study reviews the outcomes of patients in whom the conjunctival flap prematurely dehisced. Methods: Eight patients were identified during a 15 -year interval. The posterior lamellar defects ranged in size from 13 to 30 mm horizontally and 5 to 8 mm vertically. The average age {{at the time of}} eyelid reconstruction was 72 years (range, 60 - 84 years). Flap dehiscence, resulting in each case from accidental trauma, occurred between 1 and 11 days postop-eratively. Surgical repair of the dehiscence was unsuccessfully attempted in one case; otherwise, the eyelids were per-mitted to heal spontaneously with the application of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment as the sole therapy. Results: Although the result was satisfactory in each case, one patient, who had dry eyes from Sjögren’s syndrome, required secondary surgery to treat mild lagophthalmos and lower eyelid retraction. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 122 months (median, 6. 5 months). Conclusions: The ultimate functional and aesthetic outcomes after premature, traumatic dehiscence of a Hughes flap were surprisingly good, suggesting that elective division of the conjunctival pedicle in routine cases can be performed relatively soon after the primary reconstructive procedure.
