5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases <b>equilibrate</b> across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene <b>equilibrate</b> when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E
30|$|The Fo {{contents}} of olivine in the analyzed Itokawa particles including new samples {{are all in}} the limited range Fo 67 - 73. These values are close to those reported by Nakamura et al. (2011, 2014). In particular, our olivine compositional ranges are narrow (<b>equilibrated),</b> matching with those of ‘highly <b>equilibrated</b> particles’ in Nakamura et al. (2011, 2014). We did not find any ‘poorly <b>equilibrated</b> particles’ with magnesian olivine composition reaching up to Fo 75 and mesostasis portions showing glassy textures that were reported in PE samples (Nakamura et al. 2011, 2014). In these poorly <b>equilibrated</b> particles, pyroxene compositions show much wider ranges than those in highly <b>equilibrated</b> particles (Nakamura et al. 2011, 2014), but we could not investigate this issue because pyroxene is absent in our samples. Olivine in RA-QD 02 - 0179 has a slightly more Mg-rich composition than the other studied particles and overlaps with the range of poorly <b>equilibrated</b> particles. However, this olivine grain is homogeneous in having no mesostasis and unlike poorly <b>equilibrated</b> particles. Olivine in RA-QD 02 - 0133 - 1 shows a small compositional variation (Fo 70 - 71) and similarly only minor variation in Raman spectra due to compositional equilibration. Therefore, because olivine and plagioclase are contacted by a sharp grain boundary (Figure  4), we consider that it is a highly <b>equilibrated</b> particle. Thus, the samples analyzed in this study are all highly <b>equilibrated</b> particles.|$|R
30|$|This study investigates <b>equilibrated</b> {{structure}} of PE/PLLA/CNT composites at different volume fractions with the blend and di-block copolymer methods. The volume fraction and mixing methods clearly affect the <b>equilibrated</b> structure. However, the micro-structures are only {{affected by the}} <b>equilibrated</b> structure in the di-block copolymer method. Even if the volume fraction is different, micro-structures are similar when the <b>equilibrated</b> structures are the different. In the blend method, all micro-structures at different volume fractions are spherical in structure. Possible future investigations could include {{the relationship between the}} length and micro-structure at different volume fractions.|$|R
30|$|From {{the value}} of Table 5, all micro-structures of entirely di-block {{copolymers}} are ellipsoid in structure. The ellipsoid structures elongate {{with the increase of}} PE volume fraction. We use the ratio of Rg 12 /Rg 22 and Rg 12 /Rg 32 to compare their micro-structures. When the <b>equilibrated</b> structure is a perforated lamellae structure, the ratios are 0.38 and 0.32 at 10 / 10 / 1 volume fraction. When the <b>equilibrated</b> structure is tube-like, the ratios are about 0.8 at 2 / 18 / 1 and 6 / 14 / 1 volume fractions. This {{can be attributed to the}} different <b>equilibrated</b> structure at three volume fractions. The <b>equilibrated</b> structure at 10 / 10 / 1 volume fraction is perforated lamellae. The micro-structure of the entirely di-block copolymer is the longest and thinnest. In particular, this shape can arrange parallel to form the perforated lamellae structure. When the volume fraction of PE polymer increases, the <b>equilibrated</b> structure changes from perforated lamellae to the tube-like structure. If the micro-structure is thin and elongated, it is difficult for PLLA polymers to fill the spaces which are not occupied by the PE polymer and CNTs. Hence, it is easy for the shorter and wider ellipsoid structure to form the tube-like structure. Unlike the blend system, where no relationship exists between the micro-structure and the <b>equilibrated</b> structure, in the di-block copolymer system, the micro-structure and <b>equilibrated</b> structure have specific relationships such as the long and thin ellipsoid forming the perforated lamellae. It is difficult in the blend system to find the relationship between micro-structures and <b>equilibrated</b> structures due to the unrestricted conditions between PE and PLLA polymers.|$|R

25|$|Mechanisms differ for {{aliphatic}} and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic phosphonium ylides. Evidence {{suggests that}} the Wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not <b>equilibrate</b> and are therefore under kinetic reaction control. Vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized Wittig reactions.|$|E
25|$|The gas in {{a bubble}} will <b>equilibrate</b> with the {{surrounding}} tissues and will therefore contain water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, {{as well as the}} inert gas. Vascular bubbles appear to form at the venous end of capillaries and pass through the veins to {{the right side of the}} heart, and thereafter are circulated to the lungs.|$|E
30|$|The {{reservoir}} temperature {{calculated using}} the above equations individually gives two different values (281 °C and 70 °C respectively) since the reaction involved K-Na <b>equilibrates</b> at high temperatures while K/√Mg <b>equilibrates</b> at low temperatures. Further, the reaction involving K and Mg <b>equilibrates</b> is faster, and their temperatures estimated from surface geothermal waters give very low reservoir temperatures. Reactions involving K and Na do not adjust {{quickly to the}} physical environment at shallow depths. So in this case, cation geothermometry overestimates the reservoir temperature.|$|R
30|$|Dissipative {{particle}} dynamics (DPD), a mesoscopic simulation approach, is used {{to investigate}} the effect of volume fraction of polyethylene (PE) and poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) on the structural property of the immiscible PE/PLLA/carbon nanotube in a system. In this work, the interaction parameter in DPD simulation, related to the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ, is estimated by the calculation of mixing energy for each pair of components in molecular dynamics simulation. Volume fraction and mixing methods clearly affect the <b>equilibrated</b> structure. Even if the volume fraction is different, micro-structures are similar when the <b>equilibrated</b> structures are different. Unlike the blend system, where no relationship exists between the micro-structure and the <b>equilibrated</b> structure, in the di-block copolymer system, the micro-structure and <b>equilibrated</b> structure have specific relationships.|$|R
40|$|We study J/ψ {{survival}} probability, using short-distance QCD, in an <b>equilibrating</b> parton gas. The {{evolution of}} the system is determined within the Parton Cascade Model. Due to the formation {{of a large number of}} partons within this model, a large fraction of J/ψ are found to be suppressed. In a thermal <b>equilibrating</b> plasma this suppression is found to be almost 95 percent, while it is around 90 percent in a chemically <b>equilibrating</b> plasma. PACS: 12. 38.

25|$|Guanches from Gran Canaria practized {{polyandry}} {{before the}} Spanish conquest. According to European accounts, during a great famine in 14th or 15th century, girls were killed after coming {{to life in}} order to <b>equilibrate</b> demography. This resulted in a surplus of males and a shortage of females, {{which led to the}} adoption of polyandry, allowing a woman to marry a maximum of five men.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{intravenous}} dose is 10–20 mEq {{per hour and}} it is given slowly since it takes time for the electrolyte to <b>equilibrate</b> into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle. Elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia, causes the resting electrical potential of the heart muscle cells to be lower than normal (less negative). Without this negative resting potential, cardiac cells cannot repolarize (prepare for their next contraction).|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an electron-donating substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less thermodynamically stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable to <b>equilibrate</b> to the thermodynamically more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that are safer to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.|$|E

30|$|The olivine {{compositions}} in the analyzed particles {{determined by}} electron microprobe analysis and SR-XRD show {{a narrow range}} (Fo 70 - 73), corresponding {{to those of the}} LL chondrites. Because of the <b>equilibrated</b> textures and mineral compositions, we conclude that they are <b>equilibrated</b> LL chondrites. In particular, the presence of plagioclase whose grain size is larger than 2  μm suggests a petrologic type of ≥ 5. This highly <b>equilibrated</b> nature is consistent with the relatively high equilibration temperature (800 °C[*]± 10 °C) recorded by plagioclase as deduced from plagioclase crystallography determined by SR-XRD.|$|R

25|$|In general, kinetic enolates are {{favored by}} cold temperatures, {{conditions}} that give relatively ionic metal–oxygen bonding, and rapid deprotonation using a slight excess of a strong, sterically hindered base. The large base only deprotonates the more accessible hydrogen, {{and the low}} temperatures and excess base help avoid equilibration to the more stable alternate enolate after initial enolate formation. Thermodynamic enolates are favored by longer equilibration times at higher temperatures, conditions that give relatively covalent metal–oxygen bonding, and use of a slight sub-stoichiometric amount of strong base. By using insufficient base to deprotonate all of the carbonyl molecules, the enolates and carbonyls can exchange protons {{with each other and}} <b>equilibrate</b> to their more stable isomer. Using various metals and solvents can provide control over the amount of ionic character in the metal–oxygen bond.|$|E
25|$|Hammond's {{postulate}} {{is especially}} important {{when looking at the}} rate-limiting step of a reaction. However, one must be cautious when examining a multistep reaction or one with the possibility of rearrangements during an intermediate stage. In some cases, the final products appear in skewed ratios in favor of a more unstable product (called the kinetic product) rather than the more stable product (the thermodynamic product). In this case one must examine the rate-limiting step and the intermediates. Often, the rate-limiting step is the initial formation of an unstable species such as a carbocation. Then, once the carbocation is formed, subsequent rearrangements can occur. In these kinds of reactions, especially when run at lower temperatures, the reactants simply react before the rearrangements necessary to form a more stable intermediate have time to occur. At higher temperatures when microscopic reversal is easier, the more stable thermodynamic product is favored because these intermediates have time to rearrange. Whether run at high or low temperatures, the mixture of the kinetic and thermodynamic products eventually reach the same ratio, one in favor of the more stable thermodynamic product, when given time to <b>equilibrate</b> due to microreversal.|$|E

Males received a single and reduced dose of Ovaprim&# 8482; (0. 125 or 0. 25 ml/kg); control males received pituitary extract (cPE; 3 mg/kg). Fresh sperm was evaluated for volume, concentration, seminal plasma osmolality and seminal plasma pH. Then sperm was diluted in a freezing medium, <b>equilibrated</b> for 15 - 20 min and frozen in nitrogen vapor vessel (dry-shipper). Sperm motility was analyzed during 60 s post-activation in fresh, <b>equilibrated</b> and post-thaw samples.
