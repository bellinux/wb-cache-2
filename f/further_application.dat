5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A <b>further</b> <b>application</b> to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E

25|$|The first {{written report}} of {{rinderpest}} inoculation {{was published in}} a letter signed 'T.S.' in the November 1754 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine, a widely read journal which also supported the progress of smallpox inoculation. This letter reported that a Mr Dobsen had inoculated his cattle and had thus preserved 9 out of 10 of them, although this was retracted in the next issue, as it was apparently a Sir William St. Quintin who had done the inoculating (this was done by placing bits of material previously dipped in morbid discharge into an incision made in the dewlap of the animal).

They analyzed employment trends for several categories of low-wage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on low-wage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment, as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants.|$|E

25|$|The first {{experiments}} with predation and spatial heterogeneity {{were conducted by}} G.F. Gause in the 1930s, based on the Lotka-Volterra equation, which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no <b>further</b> <b>application</b> had been conducted. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested {{that the relationship between}} predators and their prey would result in population oscillations over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the population cycles accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly {{to the left of the}} peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 the Italian {{engineer}} Enrico Plancher {{developed a}} new and curious design of compound engine, which first appeared on the Rete Adriatica 500 class express locomotive; it was notable for being an asymmetrical four-cylinder design, {{in which the two}} AP and the two LP cylinders were grouped together, with each couple being served by a single piston valve which admitted steam simultaneously to the opposite ends of the two cylinders. The prototype of the class was presented at the International Railway Congress of 1900 in Paris and was looked at with interest, while not meeting with outstanding success; however, on the long run the asymmetrical design, while simple, proved to be rather awkward, as it was difficult to equalize the work of each side of the locomotive and this caused hunting. The Plancher engine was used again on some Ferrovie dello Stato designs like the FS Class 680 express locomotives and the FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotives, but no <b>further</b> <b>application</b> was approved after the widespread adoption of the superheater.|$|E

2500|$|In general, equity may {{be viewed}} as a call option on the firm, and this allows for the {{valuation}} of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse; [...] see Distressed securities. [...] Here, since the principle of limited liability protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see bond valuation. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. exercise their option) and not to liquidate. Thus analogous to out the money options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate option valuation technique.

2500|$|... where [...] is {{the number}} of {{theoretical}} plates, [...] is the apparent mobility in the separation medium and [...] is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. [...] According to this equation, the efficiency of separation is only limited by diffusion and is proportional to the strength of the electric field, although practical considerations limit the strength of the electric field to several hundred volts per centimeter. [...] Application of very high potentials (>20-30 kV) may lead to arcing or breakdown of the capillary. [...] <b>Further,</b> <b>application</b> of strong electric fields leads to resistive heating (Joule heating) of the buffer in the capillary. [...] At sufficiently high field strengths, this heating is strong enough that radial temperature gradients can develop within the capillary. [...] Since electrophoretic mobility of ions is generally temperature-dependent (due to both temperature-dependent ionization and solvent viscosity effects), a non-uniform temperature profile results in variation of electrophoretic mobility across the capillary, and a loss of resolution. [...] The onset of significant Joule heating can be determined by constructing an [...] "Ohm's Law plot", wherein the current through the capillary is measured as a function of applied potential. [...] At low fields, the current is proportional to the applied potential (Ohm's Law), whereas at higher fields the current deviates from the straight line as heating results in decreased resistance of the buffer. [...] The best resolution is typically obtained at the maximum field strength for which Joule heating is insignificant (i.e. near the boundary between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the Ohm's Law plot). [...] Generally capillaries of smaller inner diameter support use of higher field strengths, due to improved heat dissipation and smaller thermal gradients relative to larger capillaries, but with the drawbacks of lower sensitivity in absorbance detection due to shorter path length, and greater difficulty in introducing buffer and sample into the capillary (small capillaries require greater pressure and/or longer times to force fluids through the capillary).|$|E
2500|$|The Government stated that, {{unlike the}} Bail Act 1978, the new act {{is not based}} on a [...] "system of offence-based presumptions". Instead, {{it is based on the}} premise of whether the accused will present as an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] to society. The new act also allows for a <b>further</b> <b>application</b> if: the accused {{previously}} did not have legal representation, there is new relevant information, relevant circumstances have changed, or the accused is under 18 and the previous application was made on a first appearance for the offence. In May 2013, on the second reading of the Bail Bill, Attorney General and Minister for Justice Greg Smith described the Government's approach as one of [...] "risk-management". [...] The Bail Act 2013 adds an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test in regard to whether [...] "the accused will fail to appear in any proceedings for the offence, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence". One significant change is in consideration of [...] "the presumption of innocence and the general right to be at liberty." [...] Another important change is that [...] "once bail is granted, it will continue to operate until it is either revoked or the substantive proceedings concluded." [...] Under the Bail Act 2013, bail does not have to be formally continued by the court. When the bail authority determines that the accused poses an [...] "unacceptable risk", it must record the nature of the presumed risk and consider risk mitigation approaches. To determine whether there is an [...] "unacceptable risk", the bail authority can consider the person's background; the seriousness of the offence; the strength of the case; whether the person has a history of violence or non-compliance with bail requirements, apprehended violence orders, parole or good behaviour bonds; the likely length of the sentence if bail is not granted; and whether the person is of a disadvantaged group. It was noted by a member of the NSW Bar Association that, while they were not [...] "unusual or unfamiliar", not all of the factors the bail authority may consider are directly related to the [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test.|$|E
