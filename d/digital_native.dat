50|$|Marc Prensky invented and popularized {{the terms}} digital natives and digital immigrants. A <b>digital</b> <b>native,</b> {{according}} to Marc Prensky, {{is an individual}} born into the digital age. A digital immigrant refers to an individual who adopts technology later in life. These terms aid in understanding the issues of teaching digital literacy, however, simply being a <b>digital</b> <b>native</b> does not make one digitally literate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formulation}} of <b>digital</b> <b>native</b> is also challenged by researchers looking at emerging technology landscapes. The current discourse concentrates largely on developed technology {{and has a}} particular bias towards white, middle-class youth who have the privilege of access to technology. Nishant Shah (2009) says, [...] "It is necessary to promote research that grasps that not all Digital Natives are equal. Each context will have certain norms by which digital nativity is understood and experienced. Dismantling the universal <b>Digital</b> <b>Native</b> and considering contextualised <b>Digital</b> <b>Native</b> identities might also help us move away from speaking of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Native</b> as a necessarily elite power-user of technology and understand the identity {{as a point of}} departure from earlier technology-mediated identities within those contexts." [...] He also suggests that one way of understanding digital natives is to look at how they use digital technologies to engage with their immediate environments and initiate processes of social and personal change.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>digital</b> <b>native</b> {{describes}} {{a person that}} grows-up in the digital age, rather than acquiring familiarity with digital systems as an adult, as a digital immigrant. Both terms were used as early as 1996 {{as part of the}} Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.They were popularized by education consultant Marc Prensky in his 2001 article entitled Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, in which he relates the contemporary decline in American education to educators' failure to understand the needs of modern students. [...] His article posited that [...] "the arrival and rapid dissemination of digital technology in {{the last decade of the}} 20th century" [...] had changed the way students think and process information, making it difficult for them to excel academically using the outdated teaching methods of the day. In other words, children raised in a digital, media-saturated world, require a media-rich learning environment to hold their attention, and Prensky dubbed these children [...] "digital natives". Contextually, his ideas were introduced after a decade of worry over increased diagnosis of children with ADD and ADHD, which itself turned out to be largely overblown. [...] Prensky did not strictly define the <b>digital</b> <b>native</b> in his 2001 article, but it was later, arbitrarily, applied to children born after 1980, because computer bulletin board systems and Usenet were already in use at the time. The idea became popular among educators and parents, whose children fell within Prensky's definition of a <b>digital</b> <b>native,</b> and has since been embraced as an effective marketing tool. [...] It is important to note that Prensky's original paper was not a scientific one, and that no empirical data exists to support his claims. He has since abandoned his <b>digital</b> <b>native</b> metaphor in favor of digital wisdom. More recently, the Digital Visitor and Resident idea has been proposed as an alternative to understanding the various ways individuals engage with digital technology.|$|E

50|$|Gamification as a {{teaching}} tool has sparked interest in education, and Gee suggests this is because games have special properties that books cannot offer for <b>digital</b> <b>natives.</b> For instance, gamification provides an interactive environment for students to engage and practice 21st century skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, problem solving, and digital literacy. Gee presents four reasons why gamification provides a distinct way of learning to promote 21st century skills. First, games are based on problem solving and not on ones ability to memorize content knowledge. Second, gamification promotes creativity in <b>digital</b> <b>natives</b> where they are encouraged to think like a designer or modify to redesign games. Third, <b>digital</b> <b>natives</b> are beginning to co-author their games through the choices they make to solve problems and face challenges. Therefore, students' thinking is stimulated to promote metacognition since they {{have to think about}} their choices and how they will alter the course and outcome of the game. Lastly, through online gaming, <b>digital</b> <b>natives</b> are able to collaborate and learn in a more social environment. Based on the literature, one can see the potential and unique affordances digital tools have, such as online games, to meet the unique learning needs of <b>digital</b> <b>natives.</b> Furthermore, online gaming seems to provide an interactive and engaging environment that promotes the necessary skills <b>digital</b> <b>natives</b> will need to be successful in their future.|$|R
