5000|$|There is however {{controversy}} whether whitefish surviving in the North Sea {{sector of}} Denmark (Wadden Sea) and considered there as <b>houting</b> (snæbel) represent {{the same species}} as the <b>houting</b> that was extirpated from the more western parts of the North Sea. A €13 million restoration project of the Danish <b>houting,</b> partly funded by the European Union's LIFE programme and the Danish Natural Agency, was successfully undertaken in 2005-2013. The Danish <b>houting</b> is genetically part of the widespread European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus complex), or Coregonus maraena of the Baltic Sea basin, while its genetic relationship to the extinct populations cannot be confirmed. Danish researchers argue that the morphological differences between different <b>houting</b> populations are not exceptional within the broader variation of the European whitefish, and probably no species-level extinction has taken place. [...] Others think that the morphological differences are decisive, and that the last true <b>houting</b> {{was caught in the}} lower Rhine in 1940.|$|E

50|$|Monitoring of {{population}} changes through genetic means {{can be done}} retrospectively, through analysis of 'historical' DNA recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It {{can also be used}} as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations. Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. heterozygosity and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for Beringian bison, Galapagos tortoise, <b>houting,</b> Atlantic salmon, northern pike, New Zealand snapper, steelhead trout, greater prairie chicken, Mauritius kestrel and Hector's dolphin and is the subject of many ongoing studies, including Danish and Swedish brown trout populations. Measuring absolute population changes (e.g. effective population size (Ne)) can be carried out by measuring changes in population allele frequencies (‘Ftemporal’) or levels of linkage disequilibrium over time (‘LDNe’), while changing patterns of gene flow between populations can also be monitored by estimating differences in allele frequencies between populations over time. Subjects of such studies include grizzly bears, cod, red deer, Leopard frogs and Barrel Medic.|$|E
40|$|North Sea <b>houting,</b> Coregonus oxyrinchus, became {{extinct in}} the River Rhine in the 1940 s and was reintroduced in the 1990 s. To study the {{migration}} history of individuals, the 88 Sr: 44 Ca ratio of scales of 39 <b>houting</b> (10 ¿ 44 cm TL) caught in Lake IJsselmeer was analysed using laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Scales of <b>houting</b> inhabiting freshwater ponds and two Danish rivers containing the last original populations in the North Sea basin were used as controls. Fish that lived exclusively in freshwater had 88 Sr: 44 Ca ratios of around 0. 2 from the nucleus to the edge; 29 of the analysed <b>houting</b> from Lake IJsselmeer were of this type. Most of these were small, but some were mature and up to 42 cm in length. Seven <b>houting</b> had 88 Sr: 44 Ca ratios over 0. 27 from the nucleus to the scale maximum values, indicating migration to the sea at early life stages. Three <b>houting</b> with low 88 Sr: 44 Ca ratios at the scale nucleus and increased 88 Sr: 44 Ca ratios towards the scale edge probably lived in freshwater {{for a longer period}} after hatching and then moved to brackish/marine environments.

40|$|Two {{monitoring}} programmes in estuarine and freshwater {{systems in the}} Netherlands both show a recent increase in anadromous North Sea <b>houting</b> Coregonus oxyrhynchus after it disappeared there in the 1940 s.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Houting</b> (Coregonus oxyrhunchus) is an {{endangered}} species of European whitefish, in the Salmonidae family. It lives in salt water but spawns in freshwater (anadromous), and is vulnerable to relatively small habitat disturbances. It was previously distributed throughout the Wadden Sea (the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark) but it has declined severely and is now restricted {{to just a few}} rivers in Denmark. One of the main impediments to successful reproduction is the presence of even small obstacles in rivers during the spawning migration, as the <b>houting</b> is unable to pass weirs or make use of fish ladders. Furthermore, juvenile <b>houting</b> require large areas of reed beds or flooded meadows, where they forage for several months prior to migrating to the sea. Previous restocking attempts in Denmark have failed, because they were not followed up by habitat restoration. During 2005 – 2013 the Danish Nature Agency with the support of EU’s LIFE fund conducted a € 20 mill. nature restoration project with the overall objective to restore and maintain a favourable conservation status for the <b>houting</b> in four Danish river systems. The presentation will give an overview on the results and lessons learnt during the project...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{hybridization}} plays a {{key role}} in the process of speciation. However, anthropogenic (human induced) hybridization of historically isolated taxa raises conservation issues. Due to weak barriers to gene flow and the presence of endangered taxa, the whitefish species complex is an excellent study system to investigate the consequences of hybridization in conservation. We focused on three naturally reproductively isolated whitefish taxa in Germany: the endangered, anadromous North Sea <b>houting</b> (NSH) and Baltic <b>houting</b> (BH), which were reintroduced after local extinction, and the commercially stocked European whitefish (EW). To evaluate the genetic integrity of each taxon, source and reintroduced populations of NSH and BH, and EW populations were characterized based on two mitochondrial and 17 microsatellite loci. Additionally, we investigated gill raker counts as an adaptive phenotypic trait. Even though clear genetic and phenotypic differentiation confirmed the houtings as separate evolutionarily significant units, admixture analyses revealed an extensive hybrid zone. Hybridizations were introgressive, positively correlated with genetic diversity, and were reflected in the gill raker counts. The BH distribution range showed higher heterogeneity and stronger admixture than the NSH range. Erroneous stocking with non-native genotypes best explained these patterns, which pose challenges for the conservation of the endangered NSH and BH...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Closing-off the estuary Zuiderzee with a 32 km dam (Afsluitdijk) {{had severe}} {{consequences}} for fish migration between Wadden Sea and rivers IJssel/Rhine and Vecht. Plans are proposed {{to build a}} large fish passage (‘Fish Migration River’) next to the discharge sluices in the Afsluitdijk at Kornwerderzand. This passage of several km length is unique in also allowing incoming tide, thus facilitating fish using selective tidal transport. To come to an optimal design and placing of entrances that efficiently will attract diadromous fish, several {{studies were carried out}} in spring 2014 to study behaviour and abundance of migratory fish. The seaward side of the sluices were monitored with lift nets, mainly targeting flounder larvae, three-spined stickleback, smelt and glass eel. DIDSON observations were made to determine vertical distribution of fish. An acoustic telemetry experiment (18 VEMCO receivers) was carried out to study searching behaviour and passage success of sea lamprey, <b>houting</b> and sea trout. Abundance estimates for the different species varied from several tens to hundreds of millions. The spatial dynamics of small fishes in time in the Kornwerderzand discharge basin were large. Numbers of small fish in the discharge basin were high, but the highest concentrations occurred at different locations in time. Lower numbers of glass eels and sticklebacks after highwater than before upcoming tide are in accordance with Selective Tidal Transport, although smelt numbers were similar after high water, suggesting more active swimming behaviour. Telemetry data showed large dynamics and intensive searching of the whole discharge basin by the fish. Passage success of sea lamprey appeared to be limited to 12 - 25 %. In addition, substantial delay of sea lamprey migration was indicated. Passage success of <b>houting</b> and sea trout appeared to be larger than 50 %. In this, discharge events, tidal current, wind and active swimming all play a role...|$|E
40|$|Anadromous North Sea <b>houting</b> (NSH, Coregonus oxyrinchus) was {{historically}} {{distributed in}} the Wadden Sea extending from Jutland (Denmark) to the Schelde delta (Netherlands). The species has been considered extinct in the Rhine since the 1940 s; however, a successful re-introduction programme re-established a self-reproducing population. Telemetry data of adult NSH (NEDAP TRAIL System®) were used for a first description of the timing of spawning migrations of NSH in winter, but also suggested that the River IJssel, a lower branch of the Rhine, may serve as spawning ground. This was further proven in spring 2010 with drift net catches of 218 freshly hatched NSH larvae sampled directly upstream from Kampen, where the IJssel discharges into Lake IJsselmeer. These larvae did not differ between controls from a hatchery that were about 12 h of age, indicating that the drifting larvae of NSH must have hatched in upstream areas of the River IJssel...|$|E
40|$|Fish have {{problems}} passing the Afsluitdijk Dam {{that separates the}} Wadden Sea from Lake IJsselmeer. To re-establish the connectivity and thereby allow fish to pass there is an initiative to build a fishway, the Fish Migration River (FMR), at the Konwerderzand sluice complex. This report proposes a monitoring program to evaluate the functionality of the FMR, but also to monitor passage possibilities through the existing sluices. The goals of the monitoring plan are to estimate 1) The overall passage past the Afsluitdijk dam to and from Lake IJsselmeer, 2) The attraction efficiency, 3) The passage efficiency, and 4) The use of the FMR as habitat and for acclimatization for the transition into freshwater. We present an overview of previous and ongoing monitoring {{in the area to}} establish the current state of knowledge. The report also includes a presentation of available and suitable methods for a future monitoring program considering the broad spectra of target fish species, and their abundances. The proposed program includes a description of study design and available techniques and cost-estimates of the monitoring program. The proposed program will target ten species: European eel (aal), flounder (bot), three-spined stickleback (dreidoornige stekelbaars), twait shad (fint), North Sea <b>houting</b> (<b>houting),</b> river lamprey (rieverprik), smelt (spiering), Atlantic salmon (zalm), brown trout (forel) and sea lamprey (zeeprik). The monitoring program includes plans for how to capture, tag and track the study fish using the most suitable tagging techniques. Furthermore, the most optimal sites for installation of automatic data detection stations are identified. The total cost for the proposed project is 3. 5 M€ and covers both investments in equipment and costs for personnel. However, if costs for investments in techniques such as RFId-stations and fish counters are excluded, the total cost is reduced to 1 M€ for a program running two years before and four years after the completion of the FMR. The program is considered sufficient to evaluate the FMR at Kornwerederzand from the most important perspectives: the overall passage efficiency {{and the use of the}} FMR as habitat. It should be noted that this report is the first step towards a full-scale monitoring program, giving insight into possible methods, study design and associated costs. The next important step will be to develop the program in more detail and to start the initial phase of the monitoring project. We predict that such activities will identify the need for, and the relevance of, a more extensive monitoring program to study the effects of the FMR on a population level and on a large geographical scale.
