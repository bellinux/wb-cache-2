5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than <b>getting</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E

25|$|Permanently {{attached}} gloves or mitts are unusual, It is {{more common}} {{for them to be}} connected by attachment rings. Either way, the absence of a wrist seal makes <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the suit much easier since {{there is no need for}} the suit to tightly seal around the wrists. It may be necessary to use a wrist strap to prevent loose gloves pulling off the hands when filled with air. Dry gloves can also be fitted over a wrist seal, which prevents leakage into the sleeves if the gloves are penetrated.|$|E
25|$|Kayak {{stanchions}} or kayak cockpit stanchions (ayapervik sg ayaperviik dual ayaperviit pl or ayaperyaraq sg ayaperyarat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, ayaperwig in Cup'ig) are {{top piece}} centered at side of coaming {{and used as}} a support as one climbs out of a kayak. They prevented the person from falling while <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the kayak. All kayaks had ayaperviik on them. This one has a woman's frowning face with a down-turned mouth carved on it. Perhaps the other side would have a man's smiling face carved on it.|$|E

Able Data lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories.

25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and splash guard. It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the camper in cold or wet weather.|$|E
25|$|The horrea of Rome and its port, Ostia, stood two or {{more stories}} high. They were built with ramps, rather than staircases, to provide {{easy access to the}} upper floors. Grain horrea had their ground floor raised on pillars to reduce the {{likelihood}} of damp <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> spoiling the goods. Many horrea appear to have served as great trading areas with rows of small shops (tabernae) off a central courtyard; some may have been fairly elaborate, perhaps serving as the equivalent of modern shopping arcades. Others, such as those in Ostia, dispensed with the courtyard and instead had rows of tabernae standing back-to-back. In the Middle East, horrea took a very different design with a single row of very deep tabernae, all opening onto the same side; this reflected an architectural style that was widely followed in the region's palaces and temple complexes, well before the arrival of the Romans.|$|E

25|$|Because of this, the {{unemployed}} French armies {{gathered at the}} Channel ports, and the preparation for an invasion began. On 12 July Bonaparte issued an order for the assemblage at Boulogne of nine divisions of gun-vessels and of {{the same number of}} battalions of troops, besides several detachments of artillery to serve the guns on board the flotilla. Rear-Admiral Latouche Tréville was appointed the commander in chief and was given directions to exercise the troops in ship-working, in firing the guns, in boarding and in <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the vessels. Concentrations of troops and flat-bottomed boats were also reported at the ports of Le Havre and Dunkirk. These preparations were exaggerated by the French journals, including the official French government newspaper, Le Moniteur, which published the first consul’s threat of invasion on 21 June. In fact, Bonaparte’s only objective was to intimidate the British government into accepting disadvantageous peace terms.|$|E
500|$|David Krone of the Los Angeles Daily News said {{although}} he had mixed feelings about the fifth season so far, he found [...] "Stress Relief" [...] to be [...] "one of the season's best efforts". Krone specifically praised the Jim and Pam subplot and Dwight's character, adding, [...] "It's a pretty perfect way to unwind – or, if your team lost, to become reanimated – after the Super Bowl." [...] Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said the episode [...] "was funny from start to finish", particularly praising Dwight Schrute's role and the Michael Scott roast. However, Ingebritson said he was disgusted by the Leachman nude scene from Mrs. Albert Hannaday. Will Leitch of New York magazine, said the episode was funny, but [...] "curiously unfocused [...] two half-hour episodes awkwardly spliced together. He praised the Black/Leachman film, the trouble Dwight kept <b>getting</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> the Jim and Pam subplot, which he called [...] "a rare Pam-Jim plot point that worked". However, he called the Michael roast [...] "yet another Michael-wanting-to-be-loved-and-still-be-the-Boss subplot that takes over the second half".|$|E
500|$|Caldwell, Brant, {{and their}} men arrived at German Flatts {{not long after}} Helmer's warning, {{on the evening of}} September 16, and began their attack the next morning. [...] Because the {{settlers}} had taken refuge in the forts, there was no significant opportunity for the raiders to take prisoners or scalps. [...] They demonstrated before the forts, but lacked heavy weapons with which to properly assault them. [...] They instead rampaged through the communities {{on both sides of the}} Mohawk, destroying 63 homes, a similar number of barns, three grist mills, and one saw mill. [...] They drove off a large number of horses, cattle, and sheep, killing those they could not take with them. [...] The only buildings left standing were the forts, a barn, the church, and the homes of the minister and a few Loyalists. [...] More than 700 people were made homeless by their destruction. [...] Because of Helmer's warning only three Americans were killed. [...] Captain Caldwell wrote that his men [...] "would have in all probability killed most of the inhabitants of German Flatts had they not been apprised of our coming by one of the scouts <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> warning of our approach, and perhaps got to their forts".|$|E

500|$|The shows {{featured}} couture costumes {{designed by}} fashion house Ralph and Russo. Designer Tamara Ralph said Beyoncé {{asked them to}} be [...] "really creative" [...] while creating items with [...] "an ultra-glamorous feel to them". The duo's inspiration was [...] "modern showgirl", {{paying attention to the}} [...] "comfort and flexibility of each outfit and the ease of <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the pieces with quick costume changes". All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski; a team of 20 couturiers worked to complete the looks, which were embellished with more than 500,000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks. Beyoncé wore shoes by Stuart Weitzman. The dancers were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and David Koma clothes. The band wore Alexander Vauthier clothes while The Mamas wore pin-up girl clothing. Some clothes for the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles. Beyoncé also worked with David Koma who designed a panelled bodysuit with lace detailing. Koma described his collaboration during an interview with Vogue, saying, [...] "I absolutely love to work with Beyoncé and her team and I'm very happy that she is back... She looks more beautiful than ever and it's always a pleasure to work with her!". Co-designer Michael Russo further described his collaboration with Beyoncé, [...] "Beyoncé always delivers energetic performances... It was an absolute pleasure to work with her to create exquisite pieces that dazzle on stage." ...|$|E

The new settlements were guarded around-the-clock by police and were partially fortified. This served the twofold purpose of preventing those who were so inclined from getting out and voluntarily aiding the guerrilla, and of preventing the guerrilla from <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> extracting help via persuasion or intimidation.|$|E

Most conferences distribute most of the revenue evenly to its member institutions, regardless of performance.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the {{original}} series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film.

It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn't that good either!" ...|$|E
