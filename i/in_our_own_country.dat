Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} written by a Swiss-German {{historical}} demographer after having visited different Brazilian Universities in 1984 as a guest-professor. It aims at promoting a real dialog between developed and developing countries, commencing the discussion with the question: Can we learn from each other? An affirmative answer is given, {{but not in the}} superficial manner in which the discussion partners simply want to give each other some "good advice" or in which the one declares his <b>country's</b> <b>own</b> development to be the solely valid standard. Three points are emphasized: 1. Using infant mortality in S. Paulo from 1908 to 1983 as an example, it is shown that Brazil has at its disposal excellent, highly varied research literature that is unjustifiably unknown to us (in Europe) for the most part. Brazil by no means needs our tutoring lessons as regards the causal relationships; rather, we could learn two things from Brazil about this. For one, it becomes clear that our almost exclusively medical-biological view is inappropriate for passing a judgment on the present-day problems in Brazil and that any conclusions so derived are thus only transferable to a limited extent. For another, we need to reinterpret the history of infant mortality <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries</b> up to the past few decades in a much more encompassing "Brazilian" sense. 2. A fruitful dialog can only take place if both partners frankly present their problems. For this reason, the article refers with much emprasis to <b>our</b> present problems <b>in</b> dealing with death and dying - problems arising {{near the end of the}} demographic and epidemiologic transitions: the superanuation of the population, chronic-incurable illnesses as the main causes of death, the manifold dependencies of more and more elderly and really old people at the end of a long life. Brazil seems to be catching up to us in this and will be confronted with these problems sooner or later. A far-sighted discussion already at this time seems thus to be useful. 3. The article, however, does not want to conclude with the rather depressing state of affairs of problems alternatingly superseding each other. Despite the caution which definitely has a place when prognoses are being made on the basis of extrapolations from historical findings, the foreseeable development especially of the epidemiologic transition in the direction of a rectangular survival curve does nevertheless provide good reason for being rather optimistic towards the future: first in regards to the development <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries,</b> but then - assuming that the present similar tendencies of development are stuck to - also in regard to Brazil...|$|R

5000|$|Pop mogul Louis Walsh {{reacted to}} the news that Kylie Minogue and R.E.M. records qualify as [...] "Irish" [...] music for radio airplay. [...] "This is crazy," [...] he told Hot Press.

It's because we can't get airplay <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> fucking <b>country</b> for <b>our</b> <b>own</b> home grown talent. It's frustrating and unfair that we are being treated like this. Kylie Minogue is Australian - it's as simple as that. No wonder The Thrills, Ash, Declan O'Rourke, Bell X1 etc. are struggling - because they don't get enough airplay in their <b>own</b> <b>country</b> and their record deals are in the balance because of this. The big Irish radio stations all copy US radio. They're playing Timbaland, Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna and similar acts 24/7.

They'd struggle because of radio formats copying the US and the UK. And who suffers? The talent - and ultimately the public." [...] The absence of radio play directly affects sales, Walsh argued. [...] "Look at the Irish charts," [...] he said. [...] "They now look like the USA or UK charts. We need to sort this out." ...|$|R
60|$|Thespis, {{or whoever}} he were that invented tragedy (for authors differ), mingled {{with them a}} chorus and dances of Satyrs which had before {{been used in the}} celebration of their festivals, and there they were ever {{afterwards}} retained. The character of them was also kept, which was mirth and wantonness; and this was given, I suppose, to the folly of the common audience, who soon grow weary of good sense, and, as we daily see <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> age and <b>country,</b> are apt to forsake poetry, and still ready to return to buffoonery and farce. From hence it came that in the Olympic Games, where the poets contended for four prizes, the satiric tragedy was the last of them, for in the rest the Satyrs were excluded from the chorus. Amongst the plays of Euripides which are yet remaining, there is one of these satirics, which is called The Cyclops, in which we may see the nature of those poems, and from thence conclude what likeness they have to the Roman satire.|$|R

But sometimes, as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time and <b>country,</b> they are slowly brought about by organic development, so as really to resemble in all essential points the chrysalis type of evolution. Politically, socially, theologically, ethically, the old fixed beliefs seem at such periods to grow fluid or plastic. New feelings and habits and aspirations take their place. For a while a general chaos of conflicting opinions and nascent ideas is produced. The mass for the moment seems formless and lawless. Then new order supervenes, as the magma settles down and begins to crystallise; till at last, I'm afraid, the resulting social organism becomes {{for the most part}} just as rigid, just as definite, just as dogmatic, just as exacting, as the one it has superseded.

60|$|I {{think it}} may deserve a place in this history to mention the last scene of Duke Robert's life, who, either through the poorness or greatness of spirit, having outlived {{the loss of his}} honour, his dominions, his liberty, his eyesight, and his only son, was at last forced to sink under the load of eighty years, and must be allowed for the {{greatest}} example either of insensibility or contempt of earthly things, that ever appeared in a sovereign or private person. He was a prince hardly equalled by any in his time for valour, conduct, and courtesy; but his ruin began from the easiness of his nature, which whoever knew how to manage, were sure to be refused nothing they could ask. By such profusion he was reduced to those unhappy expedients of remitting his rights for a pension, of pawning his towns, and multiplying taxes, which brought him into hatred and contempt with his subjects; neither do I think any virtue so little commendable in a sovereign as that of liberality, where it exceeds what his ordinary revenues can supply; where it passes those bounds, his subjects must all be oppressed to shew his bounty to a few flatterers, or he must sell his towns, or basely renounce his rights, by becoming pensioner to some powerful prince in the neighbourhood; all which we have lived to see performed by a late monarch <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time and <b>country.</b>|$|R
60|$|I suppose that, {{taking this}} summer as a whole, {{people will not}} call it an {{appropriate}} time for praising the English climate. But for my part I will praise the English climate till I die--even if I die of the English climate. There is no weather so good as English weather. Nay, {{in a real sense}} there is no weather at all anywhere but in England. In France you have much sun and some rain; in Italy you have hot winds and cold winds; in Scotland and Ireland you have rain, either thick or thin; in America you have hells of heat and cold, and in the Tropics you have sunstrokes varied by thunderbolts. But all these you have on a broad and brutal scale, and you settle down into contentment or despair. Only <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> romantic <b>country</b> do you have the strictly romantic thing called Weather; beautiful and changing as a woman. The great English landscape painters (neglected now like everything that is English) have this salient distinction: that the Weather is not the atmosphere of their pictures; it is the subject of their pictures. They paint portraits of the Weather. The Weather sat to Constable. The Weather posed for Turner, and a deuce of a pose it was. This cannot truly be said of the greatest of their continental models or rivals. Poussin and Claude painted objects, ancient cities or perfect Arcadian shepherds through a clear medium of the climate. But in the English painters Weather is the hero; with Turner an Adelphi hero, taunting, flashing and fighting, melodramatic but really magnificent. The English climate, a tall and terrible protagonist, robed in rain and thunder and snow and sunlight, fills the whole canvas and the whole foreground. I admit the superiority of many other French things besides French art. But I will not yield an inch on the superiority of English weather and weather-painting. Why, the French have not even got a word for Weather: and you must ask for the weather in French as if you were asking for the time in English.|$|R
