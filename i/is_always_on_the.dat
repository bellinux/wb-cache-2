25|$|In many Uralic languages, {{the stress}} <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first syllable, though Nganasan shows (essentially) {{penultimate}} stress, {{and a number}} of languages of the central region (Erzya, Mari, Udmurt and Komi-Permyak) synchronically exhibit a lexical accent. The Erzya language can vary its stress in words to give specific nuances to sentential meaning.|$|E
25|$|Welsh has {{a simple}} pitch accent {{but this does}} not affect meaning because it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same syllable. It does however make it easier to {{differentiate}} words in rapid speech. The stress accent is normally on the last or penultimate syllable in Welsh, but the pitch accent is always placed on the last syllable of a word as a high pitch.|$|E
25|$|Word {{stress is}} {{predictable}} in Hawaiian for words {{with three or}} fewer moras (that is, three or fewer vowels, with diphthongs and long vowels counting as two vowels). In such cases, stress <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> penultimate mora. Longer words will also follow this pattern, but may in addition have a second stressed syllable which is not predictable. In Hawaiian, a stressed syllable is louder in volume, longer in duration and higher in pitch.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{volcanic}} loam soils, such as {{are found}} in New Zealand, {{require the use of}} four heavy draught horses to pull a double-furrow plough. Where paddocks are more square than long-rectangular it is more economical to have horses four wide in harness than two-by-two ahead, thus one horse <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ploughed land (the sod). The limits of strength and endurance of horses made greater than two-furrow ploughs uneconomic to use on one farm.|$|E
25|$|The law defines how {{the flag}} of Serbia is {{displayed}} along with other flags, making no difference between state flags {{and other kinds of}} flags. If the flag is hoisted with another flag, it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> viewer's left, except during an official visit of a representative of another country or an international organization, when {{the flag of}} the visitor is on the viewer's left. If the flag is hoisted with another on crossed staffs, its staff must be the front one.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{suggested}} that the incongruent individual, who <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic {{this is a difficult}} task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristic}} of flatfish, {{other than their}} flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{same side of the}} head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, <b>the</b> eyes <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.|$|R

25|$|Something Wicked This Way Comes can be {{interpreted}} as an allegory of the struggle between good and evil, with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality, and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side of sin and temptation. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good that <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of us that resists giving in.|$|E
25|$|The Dieter Roth Academy {{was founded}} in May 2000 by fifteen close friends and colleagues of Dieter Roth. It now {{includes}} many times that number. In his later years Dieter Roth spoke of his typically innovative idea of an academy  an institution unbound to any one place or building or curriculum. As a passionate traveller, he realised that the best experience a young artist can have is travelling and encountering new people and situations. Consequently the Dieter Roth Academy lives there where its members live and work  on several continents. And <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move, having convened now in at least eight countries.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree {{ambiguity}} and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity {{does not affect}} thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of lowest free energy scores. Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one. In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique. Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm.|$|E

25|$|While the ferries {{no longer}} {{transport}} motor vehicles, they do transport bicycles. There are two bicycle entrances to the ferry from either borough. The bike entrance <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor so bicyclists {{can enter the}} ferry from the ground without needing to enter the building. The ground entrance is also reserved exclusively for bike riders (everyone else must use the 2nd floor entrance). Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles to the waiting area and onto the boat and bicycles must be stored in the designated bicycle storage area on each boat. Cyclists are subject to screening upon arrival at the ferry terminals. Bicycles may also be taken on the lowest deck of the ferry without charge.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game that}} features live-action actors and cinematic footage, both during scenes between the gameplay {{and within the}} three-dimensional rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were {{at the peak of}} their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon. In this single-player game, the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to [...] "talk to" [...] when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, and walk. The mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier Sierra On-Line games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can click to perform an action. Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it.|$|E

2500|$|In Finnish, {{the letter}} [...] "j" [...] denotes the approximant , as in English you. For example, the two {{different}} names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter [...] "y" [...] denotes the vowel , not found in English, but similar to German [...] "ü" [...] and French [...] "u". [...] "R" [...] is rolled. The stress <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrjö Kääriäinen is pronounced [...] Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short [...] followed by an unstressed long [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Power {{amplifier}} circuits (output stages) {{are classified}} as A, B, AB and C for analog designs—and class D and E for switching designs. The power amplifier classes {{are based on the}} proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current. The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> conducting angle is 360°. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180°. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency.|$|E
