5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each <b>incineration</b> line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the <b>incineration,</b> lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the <b>incineration</b> grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Many {{extensive}} {{areas of}} Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) {{are on the}} site. Heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern, colonized by invasive species, are managed by manual removal and disposal for <b>incineration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} production occurs from waste <b>incineration,</b> metal production, and fossil-fuel {{and wood}} combustion. Total US emissions of PCCD/Fs were reduced from ca. 14kg TEq in 1987 to 1.4kg TEq in 2000.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the 29 {{occupants}} {{on board}} the aircraft died, either from multiple injuries and burns, or from <b>incineration.</b> One elderly male passenger survived the crash. The first rescuers at the crash site found him wandering about, dazed and distressed. He suffered serious burns and was admitted to hospital where he died six days later.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{is also an}} {{environmental}} hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste <b>incineration.</b> Bread, root crops, and vegetables {{also contribute to the}} cadmium in modern populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and <b>incineration</b> plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste <b>Incineration</b> Directive.|$|E
5|$|Mass exterminations {{were moved}} to two {{provisional}} gas chambers (Bunkers 1 and 2), where the killings continued while the larger Crematoria II, III, IV, and V were under construction. Bunker 2 was temporarily reactivated from May to November 1944, when large numbers of Hungarian Jews were exterminated. In summer 1944 {{the capacity of the}} crematoria and outdoor <b>incineration</b> pits was 20,000 bodies per day. A planned sixth facility—Crematorium VI—was never built.|$|E
5|$|Postmortem {{examinations}} {{were performed}} on the 28 victims of the crash. The two co-pilots died from multiple injuries. Twenty-three passengers and the two air hostesses {{were found to have}} died from multiple injuries and burns, or <b>incineration.</b> Only 12 of the 28 victims could be formally identified. The remaining 16 victims were either unrecognisable or unable to be identified and were buried in a mass grave at Perth's Karrakatta cemetery.|$|E
5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape <b>incineration,</b> but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all <b>incineration</b> facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, <b>incineration)</b> of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The <b>incineration</b> was {{recorded}} on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film—Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in {{debate about the}} burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that he regretted burning the money.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme {{that has been}} in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for <b>incineration</b> (with energy recovery) outside the council area.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste <b>incineration</b> and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete <b>incineration</b> of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Paris is {{provided}} in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources., around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash <b>incineration</b> (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh). A quarter of Paris's district heating is {{to come from a}} plant in Saint-Ouen, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from USA per year.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} body bags stored for <b>incineration</b> in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from <b>incineration,</b> some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as international standards on waste.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross, the Home Secretary, bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental <b>incineration</b> of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} cremation, Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu's {{municipal}} government is currently led by Yusuf Hussein Jimaale, who succeeded Mayor Hassan Mohamed Hussein Mungab, a former military court chairman. Among the administration's development initiatives are a US$100 million urban renewal project, {{the creation of}} garbage disposal and <b>incineration</b> plants, the launch of a citywide cleanup project, the creation of asphalt and cement plants, rehabilitation of the Town Hall and parliament buildings, reconstruction of the former Defence Ministry offices, reconstruction of correctional facilities, rehabilitation and construction of health facilities, establishment of a Police Training Center and a permanent base in Jasiira for the new Somali Armed Forces, rebuilding of the Somali Postal Service headquarters, and rehabilitation of public playgrounds in several districts. In January 2014, the Benadir administration launched the House Numbering and Post Code System. It also began distributing national identity cards in March of the same year. In addition, the municipal authorities started renovating important local government centers in September 2014, including the capital's former Fisho Guverno compound. In January 2015, the Benadir administration also opened a new Health & Safety Office to supervise health and safety practices in the city, and launched a municipal beautification campaign ahead of various international conferences that are slated to be held there.|$|E
5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste <b>Incineration</b> Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Incineration</b> {{with energy}} {{recovery}} {{is one of}} several waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion. While <b>incineration</b> and gasification technologies are similar in principle, the energy product from <b>incineration</b> is high-temperature heat whereas combustible gas is often the main energy product from gasification. <b>Incineration</b> and gasification may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in <b>incineration</b> and other waste-to-energy technologies in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., <b>incineration</b> was granted qualification for renewable energy production tax credits in 2004. Projects to add capacity to existing plants are underway, and municipalities are once again evaluating the option of building <b>incineration</b> plants rather than continue landfilling municipal wastes. However, many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of <b>incineration</b> and improved air pollution control and ash recycling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Incineration</b> is a {{key process}} in the {{treatment}} of hazardous wastes and clinical wastes. It is often imperative that medical waste be subjected to the high temperatures of <b>incineration</b> to destroy pathogens and toxic contamination it contains.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{combustion}} {{is particularly}} popular {{in countries such}} as Japan where land is a scarce resource. Denmark and Sweden have been leaders in using the energy generated from <b>incineration</b> for more than a century, in localised combined heat and power facilities supporting district heating schemes. In 2005, waste <b>incineration</b> produced 4.8% of the electricity consumption and 13.7% of the total domestic heat consumption in Denmark. A number of other European countries rely heavily on <b>incineration</b> for handling municipal waste, in particular Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, and France.|$|E
25|$|Controlled {{high-temperature}} <b>incineration,</b> above 850°C for two seconds, {{performed with}} selective additional heating, breaks down toxic {{dioxins and furans}} from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste <b>incineration.</b> Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled <b>incineration</b> of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.|$|E
25|$|Different {{results for}} the CO2 {{footprint}} of <b>incineration</b> can be reached with different assumptions. Local conditions (such as limited local district heating demand, no fossil fuel generated electricity to replace or high levels of aluminium in the waste stream) can decrease the CO2 benefits of <b>incineration.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{materials}} are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed {{and used for}} electricity production. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with coal and natural gas While <b>incineration</b> produces more greenhouse gas emissions than landfilling, the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling (without energy recovery) against <b>incineration</b> (with energy recovery) found <b>incineration</b> to be superior in all cases except for when landfill gas is recovered for electricity production.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) <b>incineration</b> is linked intimately {{to the history of}} landfills and other waste treatment technology. The merits of <b>incineration</b> are inevitably judged in relation to the alternatives available. Since the 1970s, recycling and other prevention measures have changed the context for such judgements. Since the 1990s alternative waste treatment technologies have been maturing and becoming viable.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{source to}} environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives {{on a local}} basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to <b>incineration</b> and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink. Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. <b>Incineration</b> at a high temperature (>1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfil the requirements, but even following such <b>incineration</b> residual ashes from the <b>incineration</b> should be properly taken care of.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{materials}} {{can be taken}} to the recycling depot, which is adjacent to the <b>incineration</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Incineration</b> {{is carried}} out both {{on a small scale}} by {{individuals}} and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials (such as biological medical waste). <b>Incineration</b> is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} Eunomia {{undertook}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling {{is one of the best}} options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for <b>incineration</b> or <b>incineration</b> of waste without MBT.|$|E
25|$|Recovery: some waste <b>incineration</b> {{based on}} a {{political}} non-scientific formula that upgrades the less inefficient incinerators.|$|E
25|$|The first full-scale, municipally {{operated}} <b>incineration</b> {{facility in}} the U.S. was the Arnold O. Chantland Resource Recovery Plant, built in 1975 and located in Ames, Iowa. This plant is still in operation and produces refuse-derived fuel that is sent to local power plants for fuel. The first commercially successful <b>incineration</b> plant in the U.S. was built in Saugus, Massachusetts in October 1975 by Wheelabrator Technologies, and is still in operation today.|$|E
25|$|Disposing of {{a battery}} via <b>incineration</b> may cause an {{explosion}} as steam builds up within the sealed case.|$|E
