There are optical sensors available today to detect many things from blood enzymes to glucose. Glucose sensors represent an important component in a diabetic's arsenal. However, an <b>implantable</b> glucose <b>sensor</b> that would last longer than three days does not exist. <b>Implantable</b> <b>sensors</b> that possibly hold the most promise for diabetics are those that are extremely small and can be implanted inside cells to take constant measurements. I have been working on a biological sensing system to detect changes in the glucose level at the intracellular level. An oxygen-sensitive ruthenium dye has been encapsulated in special low-temperature glass beads using the sol-gel fabrication process. The beads are billionths of a meter in diameter. When the dye-containing beads are placed in a cuvette with glucose oxidase and glucose, the enzyme metabolizes glucose and oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide and D-gluconolactone. The depletion of oxygen by the enzymatic reaction enhances the dye's fluorescence. The change in signal intensity has been measured with a spectrofluorometer and converted into the glucose concentration. I am currently working on inserting the beads into red blood cells. Red blood cells allow glucose to diffuse through its membrane and interact with the ruthenium dye labeled beads while protecting the beads from biofouling. This sensing system could prove to be invaluable technique to avoid loss of signal due to biofouling and extend the lifetime of <b>implantable</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
40|$|A glucose <b>implantable</b> <b>sensor</b> {{based on}} near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectroscopic measurements {{is expected to}} produce reliable glucose levels in human body {{for the long term}} to justify the surgical implantation procedure. Once implanted in body, the sensor will be influenced by surrounding biological environment. In context of glucose sensor, examples of such influences may include the growth of wound healing tissue encapsulating the sensor, and/or gradual growth of a thin tissue layer in the optical path of sensor over time. The former issue can be tackled by using bio-compatible polymeric materials which do not produce aggressive reaction in the body. Furthermore, the surface of such materials can be activated using antibodies which help to attract blood vessels and promote vascularization. However, no such remedy is available at hand to handle the growth of tissue layer in optical path of the sensor which might result in large variation in optical output. In a perfect world situation, this issue can be handled by increasing the input light signals, but for an <b>implantable</b> <b>sensor,</b> there are restrictions from power budget point of view ruling out the option of increasing light input. Most importantly, the output light signals depend on optical properties (especially scattering) of tissue layer grown in the optical path. In view of above, ex vivo optical characterization of wound healing tissues will be carried out. For the purpose, the in vivo grown tissues are obtained from dummy implants placed surgically in selected animals (goats). The estimated optical properties are interpreted in view of their significance in building a transmission based implantable glucose sensor...|$|E
