5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E

5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
