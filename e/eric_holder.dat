5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General <b>Eric</b> <b>Holder</b> seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity.

If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

To exercise discretion more broadly, and selectively to pick and choose which statutes to defend, only erodes the rule of law. (introduction...|$|R

The fact remains, Appellants state, that Ms. Lane still cannot transfer the firearms purchased in Virginia into D.C., in part because of a law enforced under <b>Eric</b> <b>Holder's</b> Department of Justice that requires an FFL within the jurisdiction, and so Appellants assert Ms. Lane's injury is ongoing, and thus she does have standing, as found in the appellate decision in Dearth, to pursue the preliminary injunction against Mr. Holder.|$|R
50|$|Federal Prosecutor Mary Jo White was {{appointed}} to investigate Clinton's last-minute pardon of Rich. She stepped down before the investigation was finished {{and was replaced by}} James Comey, who was critical of Clinton's pardons and of then-Deputy Attorney General <b>Eric</b> <b>Holder's</b> pardon recommendation. Rich's lawyer, Jack Quinn, had previously been Clinton's White House Counsel and chief of staff to Clinton's Vice President, Al Gore, and had had a close relationship with Holder. According to Quinn, Holder had advised that standard procedures be bypassed and the pardon petition be submitted directly to the White House. Congressional investigations were also launched. Clinton's top advisors, Chief of Staff John Podesta, White House Counsel Beth Nolan, and advisor Bruce Lindsey, testified that nearly all of the White House staff advising the president on the pardon request had urged Clinton to not grant Rich a pardon. Federal investigators ultimately found no evidence of criminal activity.|$|R
