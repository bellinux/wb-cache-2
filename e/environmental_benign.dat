An indicative technology assessment has been undertaken in order to evaluate the so-called ‘Shoots Barrage’ over its foreseen lifespan of 120 years {{in terms of its}} cradle-to-site, operation and maintenance requirements. It would be located just upriver of the Severn road crossings in the United Kingdom (UK), involve an estimated cost of £ 3. 2 bn to construct, and could potentially generate around 2. 7 TWh per year (or a little under 1 % of UK electricity demand).
