5000|$|As philosopher Robert Brandom explains:"Hegel's {{discussion}} of the dialectic of the Master and Slave {{is an attempt to}} show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with - {{to make it possible for}} us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted.

[...] (p. 170) They do not deny the significance of the organism or phenotype, which they see as vehicles of selection, or 'survival machines', which interact with other survival machines and with the environment in ways replication of the genes whose vehicles they are. But there are other replication-enhancing strategies apart from organism construction. Extended phenotypes, as exemplified by parasitic species, are common and important, with probably all parasitic gene pools including [...] "genes whose adaptive effects are on host organisms."

40|$|Abstract: In [1], {{the authors}} {{introduced}} an important new information theoretic numerical measure for assessing a system’s resistance to unknown-message side-channel attacks and computed {{a formula for}} the limit of the numerical values defined by this measure {{as the number of}} side-channel observations tends to infinity. Here, we present corresponding quantitative (exponential) bounds that yield an actual rate-of-convergence for this limit, something not given in [1]. Such rate-of-convergence results can potentially be used to significantly strengthen the utility of the limit formula of [1] as a tool to reduce computational complexity difficulties associated with calculating the side-channel attack resistance measure presented there. In addition, our <b>arguments</b> here show <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> used in [1] to prove the limit formula can be substantially simplified. ...|$|R
