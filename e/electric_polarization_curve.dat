40|$|To {{understand}} the collinear-magnetism-driven ferroelectricity in the frustrated Ising spin chain, the fascinating magnetoelectric behavior is investigated by using Monte Carlo simulation {{based on one}} dimensional elastic Ising model. Our simulation quantitatively reproduces the experimental results of the complicated electric and magnetic behaviors as functions of temperature observed in Ca₃CoMnO₆ compound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 047601 (2008) ]. Moreover, the short-ranged up-up-down-down magnetic ordering is confirmed to be the origin of <b>electric</b> <b>polarization,</b> and the <b>curves</b> of energy components dependent on temperature provide a reasonable explanation for the unconventional magnetoelectric phase transition revealed in the Ising chain magnet.

In this study, <b>polarization</b> <b>curves</b> were made under non-toxic conditions and under toxic conditions after the addition of various concentrations of nickel, bentazon, sodiumdodecyl sulfate and potassium ferricyanide. The experimental <b>polarization</b> <b>curves</b> show that toxic components {{have an effect on the}} electrochemically active bacteria in the cell. (Extended) Butler Volmer Monod (BVM) models were used to describe the <b>polarization</b> <b>curves</b> of the MFC under nontoxic and toxic conditions.

For each of the toxic components, the value of the kinetic inhibition constant Ki was also estimated from the experimental data.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{compounds}} {{possess a}} spontaneous and reversible <b>electric</b> <b>polarization,</b> P. Magnetic materials, {{on the other}} hand, display a spontaneous order of magnetic dipoles induced by electron spins. The cross-coupling between P and magnetism, which can potentially lead to novel memory storage devices, is found in magnetoelectric compounds, where magnetization can be induced by an applied electric field (or vice versa), and in so-called magnetic ferroelectrics, where a spontaneous polarization is induced by spin ordering. Understanding the physics underlying the rich variety of observed phenomena in these compounds is both of fundamental and technological interest. In this thesis we study model Hamiltonians for compounds in which magnetic ordering and <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> are coupled. Using symmetry considerations, the form of microscopic couplings between spins and <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> are obtained for different systems. These expressions are used to reveal the mechanism behind the magnetoelectric effect in Cr 2 O 3 and to find the origin of so-called electromagnon excitations in YMn 2 O 5. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of materials with so-called magnetic spiral states allows us to explain a number of recently observed phenomena, in which <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> is controlled by an applied magnetic field. These include the rotation of <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> by rotating an applied magnetic field, and the clamping of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain walls. Finally, novel effects, such as the high-temperature induction of <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> by arrays of ferromagnetic domain walls, are predicted. ...|$|R
