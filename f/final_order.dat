5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this <b>final</b> <b>order.</b> Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May the <b>final</b> <b>order</b> was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses it was {{not possible}} to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

5|$|The RN's <b>final</b> <b>order</b> was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 {{but soon}} changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Graf's {{unit was}} interned {{for over a}} week with more than 30,000 other {{disarmed}} soldiers in a primitive camp with minimal food and sanitation. Following {{the letter of the}} Allied agreement, units fighting on the Eastern Front were to become Soviet prisoners. Graf and most of the JG52 personnel were handed over by the American forces to the Soviet Union on 15 May 1945. On 20 August, he and other senior Luftwaffe officers, including Hartmann and Hans Hahn, were moved to POW Camp No. 150 in Gryazovets, northeast of Moscow. This was a (relatively) more comfortable confinement than the regular labour camps and intended to provide a more sympathetic environment for high-profile prisoners. When Graf was found not to be malleable for their purposes, the Soviet regime put him on trial for war-crimes. However, when insufficient evidence could be produced, the charges were dropped. Erich Hartmann however, was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years of forced labour. On 8 December 1945, Graf was moved to POW Camp No. 27 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow. The author, Musciano, mentions that he was subject to solitary confinement for extended periods, but that he had his <b>final</b> <b>order</b> hidden in his shoe and would re-read it to keep his sanity.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1915, Colonel Martin {{announced}} that the 5th Light Infantry was {{to be transferred to}} Hong Kong for further garrison duties, replacing another Indian regiment. However, rumours were circulated among the sepoys that they might instead be sent to Europe or to Turkey to fight against their Muslim co-religionists. Three Indian officers, Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedar Christi Khan, and Jemedar Ali Khan, were later to be identified by a court of enquiry as key conspirators in the matter. When the <b>final</b> <b>order</b> to sail to Hong Kong aboard the Nile arrived in February 1915, they and other ringleaders among the sepoys decided {{that it was time to}} rebel. On the morning of 15 February, the General Officer Commanding Singapore addressed a farewell parade of the regiment, complimenting the sepoys on their excellent turnout and referring to their departure the next day, without mentioning Hong Kong as the destination. At 3:30pm on the afternoon of the same day, four Rajput companies of the eight companies making up the 5th Light Infantry mutinied. The mostly Pathan sepoys of the remaining four companies did not join the mutiny but scattered in confusion. Two British officers of the regiment were killed as they attempted to restore order.|$|E

25|$|Should a whistleblower’s claim {{be denied}} in the {{preliminary}} determination phase and the whistleblower fail {{to submit a}} timely response, the preliminary determination becomes the SEC’s <b>final</b> <b>order.</b> If the whistleblower submits a timely response to appeal the preliminary determination decision, Office of the Whistleblower’s staff will assess the appeal and {{make a recommendation to}} the Claims Review Staff. The Office of the Whistleblower then meets again with the Claims Review Staff and the Claims Review Staff makes a proposed final determination. Office of the Whistleblower then notifies the Commission of the proposed final determination. The Commission has 30 days to review this determination. Any Commissioner can request within 30 days of receiving the proposed final determination notification, that the proposed final determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner objects during the 30-day window, the proposed final determination becomes the <b>final</b> <b>order</b> and Office of the Whistleblower then provides a copy of the <b>final</b> <b>order</b> to the whistleblower or the whilstleblower's attorney.|$|E

25|$|On February 14, two {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses in Jefferson County, Timothy Love, Lawrence Ysunza, Maurice Blanchard, and Dominique James, {{asked to be}} allowed to intervene in the suit because their challenge to Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage within the state raises substantially the same arguments as the original suit. On February 27, 2014, before the <b>final</b> <b>order</b> was issued, the state attorney general asked Judge Heyburn to stay enforcement of his Bourke order for 90 days, noting that even if the state does not appeal the decision it needs time to implement it. Judge Heyburn issued a <b>final</b> <b>order</b> in Bourke on the same day ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions at once, which created de jure legalization of recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages; being a <b>final</b> <b>order</b> it was then immediately subject to appeal. He then bifurcated the case and allowed the new plaintiffs to intervene and argue against Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to in-state {{same-sex couples}}. This portion of the case would remain in district court, retitled as Love v. Beshear. A briefing schedule on the in-state issue was completed by May 28. On February 28, 2014, Judge Heyburn issued a shorter, 21-day stay in Bourke, instead.|$|E
