The <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> includes 64 players. The winner {{turned out to be}} Tim Tebow. In their 2007 season preview magazine, CBS Sportsline.com listed McCoy as one of twelve players on the “Heisman Watch”; saying “We were touting him for the Heisman midway through his freshman season until he was injured against Kansas State. Older and stronger, McCoy has an awesome receiving corps to make a run at the hardware for real.” He {{is also one of the}} 35 quarterbacks placed on the 2007 Manning Award watch list. Further, the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award Watch List added McCoy on August 21, 2007.|$|E

An <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of 25 bases {{approved by the}} Portuguese Football Federation, following a selection process started in November 2001, was announced by the organisation on 5 February 2003.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{the award}} {{generated}} some controversy as the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> was not {{accepted by the}} Prime Minister, some government ministers had expressed concern over the nomination of three fellow ministers. Furthermore, the award to the Rapid Action Battalion was criticized by many because of RAB's alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December 2013, the ACO {{published}} its <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> {{of automatic}} invitations. Muscle Milk Pickett Racing and Team Endurance Challenge {{did not take}} up their automatic entries; Risi Competizione also turned down its invitation, but later submitted a request for another car and was granted a reserve entry.|$|E

40|$|The market {{behaviour}} of unseasoned {{new issues}} of common stock {{at the time}} of <b>initial</b> <b>listing</b> and during the period following <b>initial</b> <b>listing</b> on the Sydney Stock Exchange is investigated. The results indicate large and widespread initial returns to the new issue-cum-listing process. The average aftermarket performance was negative but was not statistically significant. We suggest that the joint process of initial issue-cum-listing in Australia, the listing requirements of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges and the vesting of allocation rights to the issue in the broker, together with barriers to entry to stockbroking in Australia, provided the market structure which facilitated underpricing of the new issues...|$|R
25|$|On October 10, 2001, al-Zawahiri {{appeared}} on the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was {{released to the public}} by U.S. President George W.

25|$|The United Nations Charter {{contains}} a Declaration Concerning Non-Self-Governing Territories. In Chapter XI, of said charter, the ¨Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories¨, specifically the Article 73 point ¨e¨ in the Charter, it states that all member States agree {{to report to}} the United Nations, annually, on the development of non-self-governing territories under their control. The <b>initial</b> <b>List</b> of Non-Self-Governing Territories was created by compiling lists of dependent territories submitted by the administering States themselves. In several instances, administering States were later allowed to remove dependent territories from the list, either unilaterally (as in the case of many French overseas departments and territories), or by vote of the General Assembly (as in the cases of Puerto Rico, Greenland, the Netherlands Antilles, and Suriname).|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} plan simple, male names {{were given to}} fighters and float planes, and female names to bombers, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and flying boats. Names beginning with T {{were given to the}} few transport planes in the Japanese inventory. Trainers were given names of trees, and gliders given names of birds. With the approval of General MacArthur, the MacArthur Southwest Pacific Code Name System came into being, circa September 1942, with an <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of 50 names. The Tennessee background of Captain Frank McCoy, {{who was in charge of}} the ATAIU, was evident immediately because the initial names had a distinct hill-country flavour, such as Zeke, Rufe, Luke, Nate and others. The ATAIU quickly exhausted its list of hillbilly names and turned to names of friends and relatives.|$|E

25|$|Salameh's arrest led {{police to}} the {{apartment}} of Abdul Rahman Yasin in Jersey City, New Jersey, which Yasin was sharing with his mother, {{in the same building}} as Ramzi Yousef's apartment. Yasin was taken to the FBI's Newark field office in Newark, New Jersey, and was then released. The next day, he flew back to Iraq, via Amman, Jordan. Yasin was later indicted for the attack, and in 2001 he was placed on the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, on which he remains today. He disappeared before the U.S. coalition invasion, Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2003. In March 1994, Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj were each convicted in the World Trade Center bombing. In May 1994, they were sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> {{of those}} to be arrested, which was drawn up by RUC Special Branch and MI5, there were 450 names, but only 350 of these were found. Key figures on the list, and many who never {{appeared}} on them, had got wind of the swoop before it began. The list included leaders of the non-violent Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association such as Ivan Barr and Michael Farrell. But, Tim Pat Coogan noted:What they did not include was a single Loyalist. Although the UVF had begun the killing and bombing, this organisation was left untouched, as were other violent Loyalist satellite organisations such as Tara, the Shankill Defence Association and the Ulster Protestant Volunteers. Faulkner was urged by the British to include a few Protestants in the trawl but, apart from two republicans, he refused.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{preparation}} involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors {{and others who}} owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal {{was accompanied by a}} list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania. His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years. In his turn, Moldovan {{sent a letter to the}} province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his <b>initial</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E

Her <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> to starboard was caused by asymmetrical flooding of the starboard side as water poured down a passageway {{at the bottom of the}} ship. When the passageway was fully flooded, the list corrected itself but the ship later began to list to port by up to ten degrees as that side also flooded asymmetrically.|$|E

500|$|Proposals to {{relocate}} 1,800 jobs to Manchester were unveiled by BBC Director General, Mark Thompson, in December 2004. The BBC justified the move as its spending per head was low in northern England {{where it had}} low approval ratings and its facilities at New Broadcasting House in Manchester needed replacing. [...] An <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of 18 sites was narrowed to a short-list of four during 2005, two in Manchester– one at Quay Street, close to Granada Studios, and one on Whitworth Street and two in Salford– one close to the Manchester Arena and one at Pier 9 on Salford Quays. The site at Salford Quays was chosen in June 2006 [...] and the move north was conditional on a satisfactory licence fee settlement from the government.|$|E
500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E

His <b>initial</b> <b>list</b> of schools included FBS schools Miami, Washington, Baylor, San Diego State, Middle Tennessee State and New Mexico as well as lower division schools such as Montana, South Carolina State and Florida A. On February 9, Forcier announced that he would be transferring to the University of Miami after narrowing his list to Kansas State, Washington, Arizona, Miami and Montana.
