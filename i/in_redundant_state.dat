50|$|The Denver-Boulder Turnpike was {{championed by}} {{business}} and university interests in Boulder due to there being no direct route between Denver and Boulder. The 17.3 mi toll road stretched from Federal Boulevard (US 287) in Westminster to Baseline Road in Boulder, and opened on January 19, 1952 with a toll of $0.25. The Valley Highway from downtown Denver opened in 1952-1954, feeding {{directly into the}} Turnpike. Most of the new highway carried SH 185 (US 87), but traffic continuing north on that route initially had to exit at 70th Avenue, now SH 224, with {{the remainder of the}} route to Federal Boulevard becoming a realignment of SH 382. When the bonds for the Turnpike were paid off ahead of time in 1967, tolls were removed, and the road became State Highway 49, which also replaced all of SH 382. US 36 was also extended at this time, following the Valley Highway (by then part of I-25) from Colfax Avenue north to SH 49, and then overlapping SH 49 to the end at Baseline Road, SH 119 on 28th Street, SH 7 to Lyons, and SH 66 to end at US 34 in Estes Park. Late <b>in</b> 1968 these <b>redundant</b> <b>state</b> highway designations were dropped, resulting in the elimination of SH 49 and SH 102, realignment of SH 119 to go more directly in Boulder, and creation of gaps on SH 7 and SH 66. In 2012 the turnpike was also given the honorary name Buffalo Highway in recognition of the University of Colorado's mascot, though this name has not achieved common use.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that level shifted phase {{disposition}} pulse width modulation (PD-PWM) achieves the best possible three-phase line-to-line output voltage spectrum for multilevel converters. However the strategy does require post modulation signal decoding to optimally select between <b>redundant</b> switched <b>states</b> and to achieve an even distribution of commutation events across all switching devices. For modular multilevel converters (MMCs), PD-PWM involves firstly scheduling the individual module switching events of both arms as an integrated process to achieve optimal harmonic performance, and then selecting between <b>redundant</b> <b>states</b> to balance the individual module capacitor voltages, and to also minimise the phase leg high frequency circulating currents. This paper discusses the design and implementation of finite state machine PD-PWM post modulator decoders for MMCs to achieve these objectives. The proposed approach has been verified in simulation and then with experimental confirmation using a two module per arm MMC...|$|R
