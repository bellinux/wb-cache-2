It is found that the longitudinal spin relaxation time is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the momentum relaxation time even in the strong scattering limit, indicating that the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation shows the Elliott-Yafet-like behaviour. Moreover, the transverse spin relaxation time is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> (<b>proportional)</b> <b>to</b> the momentum relaxation time in the weak (strong) scattering limit, both in the opposite trends against the well-established conventional D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation behaviours.

40|$|Direct {{quantitative}} {{correlations between}} the orbital order and orthorhombicity is achieved {{in a number of}} Fe-based superconductors of 122 family. The former (orbital order) is calculated from first principles simulations using experimentally determined doping and temperature dependent structural parameters while the latter (the orthorhombicity) is taken from already established experimental studies; when normalized, both the above quantities quantitatively corresponds to each other in terms of their doping as well as temperature variations. This proves that the structural transition in Fe-based materials is electronic in nature due to orbital ordering. An universal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic structure are also obtained. Most remarkable among them is the mapping of two Fe-Fe distances in the low temperature orthorhombic phase, with the band energies E_d_xz, E_d_yz of Fe at the high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone.

Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> its molecular weight.

Conventional experimental methods for determining coherency involve measuring the change in viscosity or measuring the change in thermal conductivity across the solidifying melt Conflicts arise when comparing the results of these experimental techniques to find a relationship between cooling rate and coherency fraction.

The production of 10Be is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth.

Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.

The playback signal amplitude from symmetrically recorded transition pattern was measured with varying recording transition density and recording current level. The transition density at which playback signal amplitude decreases to 50 % of isolated signal amplitude, D_, was noticed as a measure of overall resolution. The result of experiments can be summarized as follows : (i) The half amplitude density D_ is sensitive to recording current level in a thick medium, but this recording level dependency of D_ becomes less with decreasing medium thickness. (ii) The dependency of D_ on medium thickness δ can be approximately expressed as the form, D_ ∽ δ^. The value of α depends on the recording level K.

5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the cube root of the mass., eq.

This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2.

5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum).

5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E
