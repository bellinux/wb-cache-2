5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E

25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E

25|$|When {{the video}} {{switches}} {{to the real}} Aguilera, she is seen descending {{from the top of}} a circus tent on a rope, onto the back of an elephant, in Pointe shoes and a structured jeweled outfit, with her father watching adoringly in the audience. She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. The content of the telegram is then revealed to be a message of her father's death, and as Aguilera realizes that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and then sees a shadow figure of a man {{standing in front of the}} circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> her hand with the elephant necklace on it in an attempt of reconciliation. She break down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is truly gone. The video ends with a shot of Aguilera sitting on a circus box, singing and crying, before fading out to Aguilera's grief-stricken form on the ground outside the circus tent. The camera then zooms out and Aguilera is seen on the ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Palm wine (called bunuk or bounouk in the Jola language) is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{derived from the}} natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes. The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or, more recently, a bottle. The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest {{the popularity of the}} drink, such as Bunuk abajut birto, which means [...] "With palm wine, one never stands up," [...] or Ulako, kumusaet jígabulaju, which means [...] "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine." ...|$|E

There, she is introduced as the wife of Loki, {{and that they have}} a son by the name of [...] "Nari or Narfi". Sigyn is mentioned again in Gylfaginning in chapter 50, where events are described differently than in Lokasenna. Here, the gods have captured Loki and his two sons, who are stated as Váli, described as a son of Loki, and [...] "Nari or Narfi", the latter earlier described as also a son of Sigyn. Váli is changed into a wolf by the gods, and rips apart his brother [...] "Nari or Narfi". The guts of [...] "Nari or Narfi" [...] are then used to tie Loki to three stones, after which the guts turn to iron, and Skaði places a snake above Loki. Sigyn places herself beside him, where she <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a bowl to catch the dripping venom. However, when the bowl becomes full she leaves to pour out the venom. As a result, Loki is again described as shaking so violently that the planet shakes, and this process repeats until he breaks free, setting Ragnarök into motion.|$|E
