5|$|The JNA {{learned about}} Croatia's {{intention}} {{to develop its}} own military force from JNA Captain Vladimir Jager, a double agent employed by Croatia and the JNA Counterintelligence Service (KOS). The JNA devised Operation Shield (Štit), aimed at disarming the Croatian forces and the arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership, in response. Although the operation was prepared by December 1990, federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation to carry <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the Yugoslav Presidency. Instead, he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning the operation was scheduled to begin.|$|E

25|$|After {{one year}} in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's {{abilities}} as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met Josef Mysliveček and Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna, and was accepted {{as a member of}} the famous Accademia Filarmonica. In Rome, he heard Gregorio Allegri's Miserere twice in performance, in the Sistine Chapel, and wrote <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> memory, thus producing the first unauthorized copy of this closely guarded property of the Vatican.|$|E

25|$|Some modern {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves, in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity, reddish teeth and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf. This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed {{out the possibility of}} historical werewolves having been sufferers of hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe. People suffering from Down syndrome have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths. Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way {{is not part of the}} original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.|$|E
500|$|The PVV contested the 2017 general {{election}} with Wilders at its helm. Though the PVV led other parties in opinion polls {{most of the}} time, all major parties ruled out forming coalitions with the PVV, effectively locking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> any chance of taking part in, let alone leading, the next government. This raised {{the prospect of the}} PVV being locked out of power even if it won the most seats. Wilders hinted that a [...] "revolution" [...] would occur if his party won the most seats and was still shut out of government.|$|E

[...] This was attributed to Williams' lack of English as a native language gave rise to [...] "a stiffness apparent" [...] in the hymn. [...] The New York Times stated it had gained popularity because of Williams' [...] "ease and sweetness" [...] in his hymn writing.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and is {{presented}} in a five-act structure to mirror theatrical norms. This allowed for jumps in time within the episode, as well as marking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> others in the series. The plot is essentially based on Macbeth, leading Pemberton {{to suggest that the}} episode might be used [...] "on an O Level syllabus" [...] in the future. Unlike other episodes in the series, [...] "The Understudy" [...] did not take place in a family home, and for this reason, the writers were keen not to alienate viewers. After the initial idea of a group of characters backstage at a production of Macbeth, the writers re-scripted several times, unsure of whether the characters should be amateurs, members of a touring company or professionals. This meant that the script-writing took longer for [...] "The Understudy" [...] than for any other episode of the first series of Inside No. 9. The script eventually settled on actors at a West End theatre. For Shearsmith, it mattered that the actors had a [...] "real chance" [...] and that there were high stakes. The episode, he suggested, reflected happenings in a real theatre, rather than a television version. Pemberton said that the West End setting allowed for the [...] "agonising" [...] scene of a post-performance visit from audience members.|$|E

Many of the Highland dances now lost to us were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe & dirk and the flail, the old Skye dancing song, [...] "Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann," [...] (I will strike your head) indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, [...] "for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2005 and 2006 iPlayer trials, {{the digital}} rights {{management}} (DRM) system used was based on Microsoft's Windows Media DRM, which led to concerns about cross-platform availability, as this technology is available only for Windows XP. However, some users have managed to get it working using compatibility options in Microsoft's Windows Vista. The BBC emphasises that it [...] "has a commitment to platform neutrality and a remit to make its content as widely available as possible", and that while the initial trial used a Microsoft-based technology, they are constantly looking for new technologies which {{would enable them to}} relax the restriction: Ashley Highfield, then BBC's director of Future Media and Technology, explained that [...] "we have always started with the platform that reaches the most number of people and then rolled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> there". They also point out that not all of the content delivered through the iPlayer will be subject to DRM – live streaming content, for instance, may not need the same level of control, presumably implying that players for OS X and Linux systems could be developed with a restricted range of content. However, a project was started to enable the iPlayer to work with other platforms via the Wine project. Streaming via the BBC iPlayer website is now available in all browsers supporting Adobe Flash. Also, iPlayer Desktop, which allows downloading programmes for later offline viewing, is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.|$|E
