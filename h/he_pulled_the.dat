5|$|He succeeded Balthasar for {{the second}} time as JG 2 commander, who had died in combat with Spitfires over {{northern}} France when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> tail off his Bf 109F in a dive. The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E

Jackson was the only President to {{completely}} pay off the debt. The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836.|$|E
25|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred at}} the tour's second stop at the PNE Coliseum on March 2, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After Manson made a lewd remark about Love during his band's performance, Love ran onstage, hiked her dress and jumped on Manson's back while he sang. Later in the show, Manson suffered from dizziness and fainted onstage, injuring his hand on a monitor as he fell. Initially he pretended {{it was part of}} the show, but left the stage after performing their signature song to seek medical attention. When he returned onstage, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> plugs off of their instrument amplifiers and stormed offstage without performing an encore. The rest of the band left the stage afterward.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Hughes {{gained control}} of RKO, a {{struggling}} major Hollywood studio, by acquiring 25% of the outstanding stock from Floyd Odlum's Atlas Corporation. Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed three-quarters {{of the work force}} and production was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with RKO as far as their political leanings were concerned. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women who were under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film's anti-communist politics were not sufficiently clear, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group connected to the mafia with no experience in the industry also disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.|$|E

25|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Texas Tornado match between Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan). In this match, all the {{competitors}} were legal {{and there was}} no need to be tagged in. Sullivan and Rick started against each other while Rotunda and Scott battled each other. Rotunda dominated Scott and threw him out of the ring, which allowed Rotunda and Sullivan to double-team Rick. Scott entered the ring and Rick delivered a Belly To Back Suplex to Sullivan. Sullivan tossed Rick on the floor outside the ring. The match continued as Sullivan and Rotunda dominated the match. Rick tried to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steinerline, to Sullivan but Sullivan tossed him out of the ring. Scott was double teamed by Varsity Club. Rotunda came off the ropes to attack Scott but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> rope down causing Rotunda to fall to the floor. In the ring, Sullivan tried to deliver a Shoulderbreaker to Rick but Scott delivered a Diving Crossbody on Sullivan. Both Steiner Brothers fell on Sullivan and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsibility}} for Maya Pass lay with Stewart's 2nd Division. That morning, Stewart {{decided that the}} French would not attack, left the brigades of Major General William Pringle and Lieutenant Colonel John Cameron in the valley and rode to Elizondo, ten miles to the south. Some French soldiers were seen and light companies were sent up {{in support of the}} picket. When the French attacked in force, the British forces in the valley had to climb to the pass in full kit. By the time they got up, the picket force was wiped out and 10,000 of d'Erlon's men occupied the pass. In the Battle of Maya, Pringle opposed Darmagnac's division, while Cameron faced the rest of the French corps. The 4,000 British tried manfully to retake the pass, but they were unable to do so. On the other hand, the narrowness of the defile helped the British to hold off d'Erlon's immensely superior force. When Stewart returned at 2:00 pm, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> redcoats back to a second position. By 3:00 pm, the British {{were on the verge of}} disaster. At this point, Major General Edward Barnes's brigade of Dalhousie's 7th Division arrived from the west to strike d'Erlon in the flank and the battle died down. The British lost 1,610 men and four cannons out of 6,000, while French losses numbered 2,100 out of 20,900. That evening, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill authorized a retreat to Elizondo. D'Erlon worried about Barnes's incursion and pursued very cautiously the next day. He only advanced six miles on the 26th.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{original}} trailer {{features a}} jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer {{on a tour}} of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is [...] "tracked" [...] with Herrmann's Psycho theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy The Trouble with Harry; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, [...] "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.|$|E
500|$|In 1670, Rosmadec {{approached}} Claude de Lannion {{again and}} requested him {{to break the}} statue into pieces. Lannion ordered this to be done. However, the workmen, for fear of the peasants and devotees, only mutilated one of her breasts and one arm and again threw the statue into the same river. Soon after this, Claude de Lannion fell from his horse and died, which devotees considered as [...] "a judgement from heaven for his having consented to destroy the idol." [...] The statue remained in the river for 25 years until Bishop Rosmadec decided to root out paganism in his diocese and asked Pierre de Lannion, son of Claude de Lannion, to destroy the statue. As Pierre was an antiquarian, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> statue up from the river in 1695 but did not destroy it. The events associated with the demolition and restoration became a local cause célèbre.|$|E

500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> headphones off.|$|E
500|$|After leaving rehab, Goldstein began {{attending}} raves and {{experimenting with}} MDMA and nitrous oxide. He also started deejaying, {{breaking into a}} friend's home while he was away for the weekend to practice on his turntables and eventually going on to practice freestyle deejaying {{every day for a}} whole summer. Goldstein started using crack cocaine by the age of 20. He said that consuming the drug and deejaying were [...] "about all he did" [...] {{for the next four years}} of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days though subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.|$|E
