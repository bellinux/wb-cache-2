40|$|The {{motif of}} Jacob s vision in John 1 : 51 {{is used to}} prove that Jesus was the apocalyptic Son of Man who {{fulfilled}} the promise {{that was given to}} Jacob through his dream in Genesis 28 : 12. This dream was different from Joseph s (Gn 37 : 9) or Abimelech s (Gn 20 : 8). From the gate of heaven that Jacob mentioned after the dream, it is possible to interpret the vision of Jacob eschatologically. In Ezekiel s vision (Ezk 1 : 1) and Daniel s vision (Dn 7 : 13), there are eschatological approaches about the open heaven and the one that comes from heaven. Therefore the vision of Jacob through the dream in Bethel was interpreted eschatologically by later traditions. The interpretation of the Rabbinic tradition about Jacob s dream has an eschatological perspective. For example: the author of <b>Jacob</b> <b>s</b> <b>Ladder,</b> the first century CE Pseudepigraphon, interpreted it as an eschatological vision according to their interpretation of the archangel in Genesis 5 - 7. The Rabbi in Genesis Rabba also interpreted it as a celestial icon as it is perceived in mysticism. Jacob s dream is mentioned in the Testament of Levi, and the dream of Levi is added to it. The dream of Levi is an extension of Jacob s dream. Levi was invited to heaven by the angel to receive the priesthood. It is a celestial interpretation of Jacob s vision. In the tradition of the intertestamental period, the Son of Man was understood as an eschatological figure.
