2500|$|Gnyozdovo is {{situated}} downstream from the DvinaDnieper portages, {{at a point}} where the Svinets and several small waterways empty into the Dnieper. Like Smolensk at a later period, Gnyozdovo flourished through trade along the Dnieper going south to Constantinople and north over portages to the Dvina and the Lovat, two rivers flowing to the Baltic Sea.

After internal tensions within Kievan Rus settled down, the site of Gnyozdovo [...] "formed the critical <b>exchange</b> <b>centre</b> and refitting base on the route from the Baltic to the Black Sea".|$|E
