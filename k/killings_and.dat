5|$|Along with Organized Noize, {{other members}} of the Dungeon Family worked on the album, {{including}} Goodie Mob, Mr. DJ, Debra <b>Killings,</b> <b>and</b> Society of Soul. The album was mixed at Sound on Sound in New York City, Bosstown, D.A.R.P. Studios, Tree Sound, and Studio LaCoCo in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{details of}} the {{massacre}} are sketchy, {{and based on the}} accounts of four U.S. soldiers who survived the event. Three captured North Korean soldiers were pointed out by the survivors as participants in the <b>killings,</b> <b>and</b> these three also gave conflicting accounts of what happened.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the Allies prosecuted the {{officers}} {{responsible for the}} murders on board Tone. Vice Admiral Takasu had died from disease in September 1944, but Sakonju was tried by the British in 1947 at Hong Kong and sentenced to death. Mayuzumi was also convicted {{for his role in}} the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to seven years imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's {{policies}} {{resulted in}} the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler did not speak publicly about the <b>killings,</b> <b>and</b> seems never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the event's commencement, TNA held a thirty-minute pre-show. It {{featured}} a Three Way Tag Team match between the 3Live Kru (Ron <b>Killings</b> <b>and</b> Konnan), {{the team of}} David Young and Lex Lovett, and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were accompanied by Chris Candido, which lasted 6 minutes and 34 seconds. 3Live Kru were the victors in the contest after Killings gained the pinfall by forcing Young's face into the mat.|$|E

5|$|Suffolk police {{linked the}} <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> {{launched}} a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Sumac. Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance {{owing to the}} magnitude of the investigation. A senior investigator with the Metropolitan Police, Commander Dave Johnston, was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from Scotland Yard in London in an advisory capacity. The day-to-day investigation was conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull.|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) later charged Slobodan Milošević with the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> Vojislav Šešelj with the {{deportation}} of non-Serbs from Voćin. In 2015, the International Court of Justice ruled that the massacre in Voćin was not an example of genocide, and stated that Croatia had failed {{to prove that the}} killings had even occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Bobby Roode, who {{was accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, against Ron Killings. The duration of the match was 9 minutes and 53 seconds. Konnan interfered in the bout distracting Killings, which allowed Roode to sneak up behind <b>Killings</b> <b>and</b> {{hit him in the}} back of the head with Roode's signature Northern Lariat maneuver.|$|E

5|$|The {{gathering}} {{began with}} a Six Man Tag Team match between the 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron <b>Killings)</b> <b>and</b> The Diamonds in the Rough (David Young, Elix Skipper, and Simon Diamond). The duration of the bout was 4 minutes and 20 seconds. Konnan used his shoe as a weapon during the encounter. 3Live Kru won the match by pinfall after Konnan slammed Young face-first into the mat with his signature Facejam maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{describes}} the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> disappearances {{of some of}} the residents of Blair, Maryland (a fictitious town on the site of Burkittsville, Maryland) from the 18th to 20th centuries. Residents blamed these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward, a Blair resident accused of practicing witchcraft in 1785 and sentenced to death by exposure. The Curse of the Blair Witch presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, newsreels, television news reports, and staged interviews.|$|E
5|$|A Tag Team Street Fight pitting the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) {{against the}} team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw was {{promoted}} for the undercard. On the June24 episode of Impact!, Brown and The Outlaw attacked Konnan and Killings during an interview with TNA commentator Mike Tenay. Brown and The Outlaw proceeded to parody Konnan, <b>Killings,</b> <b>and</b> 3Live Kru member B.G. James leading up to No Surrender. Following a fight between Konnan, Killings, Brown, and The Outlaw on the July15 episode of Impact!, Tenay announced the two teams were scheduled for a Street Fight at No Surrender.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} at Alkozai and Balandi, Bales handed himself over into ISAF custody. Afghan forces spotted him leaving his outpost before the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> U.S. commanders on base {{assembled}} their troops for a head count {{when it was}} discovered that a soldier was missing. A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier, but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident. There were no military operations being conducted in the area {{at the time of the}} shootings.|$|E
5|$|From 1962 until 1965 Fakih {{served as}} the First Deputy Chair of Muhammadiyah under Ahmad Badawi, {{providing}} guidance for young religious leaders. During the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> power shift which followed the 30 September Movement coup attempt, Fakih and several Muhammadiyah members sent a letter requesting that Masyumi be allowed to reform; this permission was not granted. For Badawi's second term, Fakih served as an advisor to the chairman, often taking management responsibilities. He {{was selected as the}} organisation's chairman at the 37th Muhammadiyah Congress in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the <b>killings</b> <b>and</b> due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Triple X {{reformed}} at Victory Road (which {{became a}} July PPV event in 2006) {{with all three}} members of the original alliance: Daniels, Skipper, and Senshi. Before the reunion in 2007, Daniels had a successful career as a singles competitor. At TNA's March PPV event, Destination X, Daniels won the TNA X Division Championship from Styles in an Ultimate X Challenge match involving Ron <b>Killings</b> <b>and</b> his former partner, Eilx Skipper. Afterward, Daniels went on to make successful defenses and winning the championship three times; Skipper's singles career was not as victorious.|$|E
