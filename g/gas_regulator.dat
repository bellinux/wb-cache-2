25|$|A design {{described}} in Practical Mechanics magazine in January 1955 as a home-made aqualung with a first-stage on the cylinder top leading through an intermediate-pressure hose {{to a large}} round second-stage (a converted Calor <b>Gas</b> <b>regulator)</b> on the diver's chest connected to the diver's mouthpiece by a twin-hose loop.|$|E
25|$|These are {{generally}} used in {{surface supply diving}} with free-flow masks and helmets. They are usually a large high-flow rated industrial <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> that is manually controlled at the gas panel on the surface to the pressure required to provide the desired flow rate to the diver. Free flow is not normally used on scuba equipment as the high gas flow rates are inefficient and wasteful.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{flow rates}} are usually {{controlled}} by an industrial <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> on the cylinder, {{and may be}} measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes.|$|E

25|$|Breathing <b>gas</b> <b>regulators</b> {{will work}} {{efficiently}} {{down to a}} cylinder pressure slightly above the designed interstage pressure. This pressure may be called minimum functional cylinder pressure. It will vary with depth as the nominal interstage pressure is additional to the ambient pressure.|$|R
40|$|The current {{electric}} <b>gas</b> pressure <b>regulator</b> often adopts {{the conventional}} PID control algorithm to take drive {{control of the}} core part (micromotor) of electric <b>gas</b> pressure <b>regulator.</b> In order to further improve tracking performance and to shorten response time, this paper presents an improved PID intelligent control algorithm which applies to the electric <b>gas</b> pressure <b>regulator.</b> The algorithm uses the improved RBF neural network based on PSO algorithm to make online adjustment on PID parameters. Theoretical analysis and simulation result show that the algorithm shortens the step response time and improves tracking performance...|$|R
25|$|In 1956 and {{for some}} years {{afterwards}} in Britain, factory-made aqualungs were very expensive, and many aqualungs of this type were made by sport divers in diving clubs' workshops, using miscellaneous industrial and war-surplus parts. One necessary raw material was a Calor Gas bottled butane <b>gas</b> <b>regulator,</b> whose 1950s version was like an aqualung regulator's second stage but passed gas {{all the time because}} its diaphragm was spring-loaded; conversion included changing the spring and making several big holes in the wet-side casing. The cylinder was often an ex-RAF pilot's oxygen cylinder; some of these cylinders were called tadpoles from their shape.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E
500|$|The barrel has a rifling {{twist rate}} of one turn in [...] Because firing heats up the bore, the {{air-cooled}} barrel {{is equipped with a}} mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare. A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a M192 Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> was discarded as part of a product improvement program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85r/min.|$|E
50|$|Siebe Gorman had {{a policy}} in Great Britain until around 1956 of keeping prices of aqualungs {{too high for}} most civilians to afford; legal {{restrictions}} on exporting currency stopped people from importing cheaper foreign aqualungs. See Timeline of underwater technology#Public interest in scuba diving takes off for how this barrier broke down, starting with British sport divers making their own aqualungs from ex-RAF cylinders and converted Calor <b>gas</b> <b>regulators.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{rate of fire}} may be {{controlled}} by three different <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> settings. The first setting allows the weapon to cycle at 650-750 rounds per minute, the second setting being 750-850 rounds per minute, and the third setting being 850-950 rounds per minute. These settings are changed by dismounting the barrel, removing the <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> collar and turning the <b>gas</b> <b>regulator</b> to allow more or less gas {{to move through the}} weapon system. It is generally performed only when necessary to return the gun to operation after fouling has caused sluggish operation and there is no time to properly clean the weapon.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} by which the hydrogen fugacity within cold-seal hydrothermal vessels can be controlled roughly using mixtures of argon and methane as the pressure medium.
