5|$|The average cardiac output, {{using an}} average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, {{with a normal}} range of 4.0–8.0 L/min.

They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E

5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an <b>echocardiogram</b> and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an <b>echocardiogram</b> can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an <b>echocardiogram.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY To {{quantify}} potential biases {{in the use}} of echocardiography in epidemiologic studies, {{we assessed}} the relationship of sex, age, vital capacity, body fatness, and overt cardiovascular disease to prevalence of acceptable <b>echocardiograms</b> in 6148 Framingham men and women aged 17 to 90 years. <b>Echocardiograms</b> adequate to assess left ventricular chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses, aortic root, and left atrial dimensions as well as mitral and aortic valves were obtained in 4947 (80 %) of the 6148 subjects. The prevalence of acceptable <b>echocardiograms</b> ranged from less than 50 % for those more than 80 years of age to more than 96 % for subjects under 30 years of age. A significant learning curve was apparent, particularly in the older subjects (more than 60 years of age) for whom prevalence of acceptable <b>echocardiograms</b> rose from a minimum of 28 % during the first 5 months of studies to a maximum of 74 to 81 % during studies 2 years later. The likelihood of unacceptable <b>echocardiograms</b> was slightly greater in men. Obesity (in subjects younger than 60 years of age), lower vital capacity, and overt cardiovascular disease were associated with unacceptable <b>echocardiograms,</b> independent of age. Consideration of these biases should aid in the interpretation and planning of epidemiologic and other studies using echocardiography.

5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An <b>echocardiogram</b> is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} image {{coronary}} arteries in excised hearts. Methods: Twelve excised pigs' hearts were imaged {{in a water}} bath. The aortic valve was closed surgically. A contrast agent (Echovist) was Injected into the aortic root and selectively into single coronary arteries. Three-dimensional (3 D) imaging was performed with TomTec Echoscan equipment. Mechanical rotations were performed at 1 degrees intervals. The hearts were visualized by InVivo software. Selective coloring of coronary arteries in 3 D data sets was obtained by using color superpositioning, which differentiates information before and after injection of contrast. Distance measurements were performed in conventional 3 D <b>echocardiograms</b> of coronary arteries and color-superimposed <b>echocardiograms</b> and compared with those from angiograms and casts. Results: After a learning curve, during which optimal conditions for the visualization of coronary arteries were determined, a quick display of all major parts of the coronary tree was obtained. Distance measurements (n > 400) revealed that fundamental contrast echocardiography overestimated angiography by 25 % +/- 5 % and casts by 28 % +/- 6 %. However, distances in color-superimposed <b>echocardiograms</b> (flow mode 4) {{were not significantly different}} from those obtained from angiograms and casts. In harmonic contrast <b>echocardiograms,</b> color super-positioning gave smaller distances compared with those from fundamental contrast <b>echocardiograms,</b> though they were still significantly larger than the reference diameters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the value of two-dimensional echocardiography in detecting constrictive pericarditis. Serial two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in eight closed chest conscious dogs with experimental constrictive pericarditis, using a new model that creates constrictive pericarditis by the introduction of a pericardial irritant mixture. Constrictive pericarditis was confirmed in these dogs by cardiac catheterization and pathologic examination. Four patients with constrictive pericarditis and three patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (amyloidosis) were also studied. Analysis of short-axis two-dimensional <b>echocardiograms</b> was performed to determine the frame by frame change in left ventricular cavity areas throughout diastole. Curves of diastolic left ventricular cavity area change versus percent duration of diastole were constructed for each animal and human subject. Pericardial thickness was measured at various gain settings on two-dimensional and M-mode <b>echocardiograms</b> and at postmortem examination. In dogs with constrictive pericarditis, the <b>echocardiograms</b> seriously overestimated and correlated poorly with pathologic measurements of pericardial thickness. In dogs after constrictive pericarditis developed, 69 ± 11 % (mean ± SD) (range 50 to 84) of cavity area change occurred in the initial 30 % of diastole compared with 35 ± 7 % (range 20 to 45) in control two-dimensional <b>echocardiograms</b> (p < 0. 001). Four patients with constrictive pericarditis showed similar accelerated cavity expansion in early diastole, but three patients with cardiac amyloidosis showed more variable left ventricular diastolic expansion rates. It is concluded that two-dimensional <b>echocardiograms</b> can demonstrate characteristic diastolic filling abnormalities in constrictive pericarditis, but cannot accurately measure pericardial thickness...|$|R
25|$|A {{standard}} <b>echocardiogram</b> is {{also known}} as a transthoracic <b>echocardiogram,</b> or cardiac ultrasound.

25|$|In {{massive and}} submassive PE, {{dysfunction}} {{of the right}} side of the heart may be seen on echocardiography, an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and the right ventricle, a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To reexamine the {{changing}} role of echocardiography for primary care evaluation of essential hypertension since the 1993 Canadian Hypertension Society Consensus Conference. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: New recommendations from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Hypertension Society. Recommendations from the American College of Cardiology {{based on a}} prospective, randomized controlled trial of limited <b>echocardiograms.</b> Further results from the Framingham Heart Study and the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study. MAIN MESSAGE: For patients with essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) {{continues to be a}} strong predictor of many cardiovascular end points, and echocardiography is a much more sensitive tool for detecting LVH than electrocardiogram (ECG). Although limited <b>echocardiograms</b> are not usually used, they are a less costly method of evaluating LVH than standard <b>echocardiograms</b> and have recently been recommended in the United States to assist in the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy for patients with stage 1 hypertension and no other evidence of target organ damage. Problems with intrareader and interreader variability of results are being addressed by technical and mathematical standards established by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Hypertension Society.
