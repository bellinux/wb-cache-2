The behavior of the first band basically depends on the geometry of the outer folded SIR. The second band, however, is strongly influenced by the presence of the inner stub. Additional design flexibility is achieved by allowing the inner stub to be located at an arbitrary position along the high impedance line section of the main SIR.

40|$|Abstract In this {{contribution}} {{we propose}} a novel {{structure for the}} implementation of transmission zeros using the zero shifting property. In previous implementations, two open loop resonators operating at different resonances were employed. In the novel conguration, one of the open loop resonators is substituted by a short-circuited transmission line, thus resulting into a more compact structure. Also, the new conguration is able to support larger bandwidth than tranditional designs. This is due to an improved capability to increase the coupling between the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> to the new short-circuited transmission line.
