40|$|The Bidder Qualification Application (the “Application”) captures {{information}} for the FDIC to qualify persons or entities for participation in structured transactions involving the sealed-bid auction of a Private Owner Interest {{in one or more}} Companies to which the FDIC as receiver will transfer Portfolios. As is outlined in the Application Scorecard Overview included in Appendix C, the Application is comprised of two levels of questioning. Prospective Bidders will provide responses in the space provided in the Application itself. Certain questions allow for the provision of additional information {{in the form of an}} attachment to the Application. Certain capitalized terms used in the Application without separate definition have the meanings given them in the Bidder Qualification Application Guidance and Instructions (the “Guidance and Instructions”). To ensure a diversity of participation, the FDIC welcomes and strongly encourages MWO Businesses to participate in FDIC structured transactions as Lead Bidders, Investors, Servicers or Asset Managers. Guidance for Completing the Application This document should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Guidance and Instructions and Bidder Qualification Application Frequently Asked Questions, which provide further guidance on the completion of the following sections. Any additional questions regarding this document may be directed to the bidder qualification e-mail address established for the <b>designated</b> <b>transaction</b> and referenced in the preliminary sale announcement. If the Prospective Bidder has completed an Application within the past six months, the Prospective Bidder may complete the affidavit included as Appendix A (“Affidavit”) and submit the following...|$|E

5000|$|Guarantee is a {{legal term}} more {{comprehensive}} and of higher import than either warranty or [...] "security". It most commonly <b>designates</b> a private <b>transaction</b> by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him. It may also designate a treaty through which claims, rights or possessions are secured.|$|R

Personal cards carry the passenger's name and picture, and allow the {{purchase}} of a wider variety of products such as monthly passes, student passes and senior-citizen passes. Also, Personalization provides insurance in case of a lost or stolen card. Personal cards can only be issued at the <b>designated</b> purchase points. <b>Transactions</b> carried out on personal cards are tracked, in order to provide the insurance - on report of a lost or stolen card, a new card is issued with the set of credits equivalent to the state of the card when last legitimately used. Data is also aggregated anonymously for statistical purposes.|$|R

Commission staff {{finds that}} the Applicants have failed to carry their burden of proving that the proposed transaction, on balance, will serve the public interest. Upon Careful examination summarized in this document, the staff concludes that significant harms to competition are likely to result, primarily {{in the form of}} increased prices for consumers, reduced incentives for innovation, an decreased consumer choice. In addition, there are serious allegations of other harms that require further investigation. Staff further finds that the bulk of the Applicants' proffered benefits are inadequately supported by the data supplied, achievable through means other than the elimination of a competitor, or otherwise not cognizable under the Commission's public interest standard. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission <b>designate</b> the proposed <b>transaction</b> for hearing pursuant to § 309(e) of the Communications Act.|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{topics of}} optimal meter placement and transaction-based loss allocation in deregulated power system operation are investigated. Firstly, Chapter II introduces {{the basic idea}} of candidate measurement identification, which is the selection of candidate measurement sets, each of which will make the system observable under a given contingency (loss of measurements and network topology changes). A new method is then developed for optimal meter placement, which is {{the choice of the}} optimal combination out of the selected candidate measurement sets in order to ensure the entire system observability under any one of the contingencies. A new method, which allows a natural separation of losses among individual transactions in a multiple-transaction setting is proposed in Chapter III. The proposed method does not use any approximations such as a D. C. power flow, avoiding method induced inaccuracies. The power network losses are expressed in terms of individual power transactions. A transaction-loss matrix, which illustrates the breakdown of losses introduced by each individual transaction and interactions between any two transactions, is created. The network losses can then be allocated to each transaction based on the transaction-loss matrix entries. The conventional power flow analysis is extended in Chapter IV to combine with the transaction loss allocation. A systematic solution procedure is formed in order to adjust generation while simultaneously allocating losses to the generators <b>designated</b> by individual <b>transactions.</b> Furthermore, Chapter V presents an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm to optimize the loss compensation if some transactions elect to purchase the loss service from the Independent System Operator (ISO) and accordingly the incurred losses are fairly allocated back to individual transactions. IEEE test systems have been used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
