5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

In 1959, Arneil left South Africa, bound for Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|The 1868 {{convention}} {{witnessed a}} meaningful {{discussion on the}} topic of pulpit and altar fellowship, one of the Four Points in American Lutheranism. Although there were several dissenting opinions, most of the pastors and lay delegates realized that they could not in good conscience exchange pastors with non-Lutherans or <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> commune at their altar. They felt that the position the General Council took on this subject was inadequate. They resolved that, unless it changed course, they would withdraw from the General Council.|$|E
25|$|In early July it {{appeared}} that he had jinxed both their chances with Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent {{at the bottom of}} the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used to hammer out their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a reception at Number 10 to celebrate.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{celebrate}} {{the foundation of the}} club, Isaias White sent a letter to Recreativo de Huelva, to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> play a football match in Seville. That letter was published by the Spanish newspaper La Provincia. Huelva Recreation accepted the invitation and the match took place on 8 March 1890, being thus the first official match ever played in Spain. Sevilla FC won that historical match 2–0, with the first goal in an official match in Spanish football history scored by the Seville team player Ritson. Isaias lived at Calle Bailen 41 in Seville (the house still exists but has since been renumbered) making this the first home of Sevilla FC.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 1956, the French Cabinet decided upon {{military}} action against Egypt in alliance with Israel, and Admiral Nomy of the French Naval General Staff was sent to Britain to inform the leaders of that country of France's decision, and to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> co-operate if interested. At the same time, Mollet felt very much offended by what he {{considered to be the}} lackadaisical attitude of the Eisenhower administration to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. This was especially the case because earlier in 1956 the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had offered the French a deal whereby if Moscow ended its support of the FLN in Algeria, Paris would pull out of NATO and became neutral in the Cold War.|$|E

Cardinal Roger Mahony and other Roman Catholic Church officials of Los Angeles, angered that Satan does not <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the party, plan to call the fire marshal the night of the party to complain, thus ruining it. When they are unable to do so after discovering that the fire marshal was also invited to the party, the clergy decide to crash it. However, Satan's security make sure they do not get in at all.|$|E
25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E

[...] On June 22, 2010, Josef Adalian of New York magazine revealed that the reality show would not go ahead, due to Murphy's desire to concentrate on the main series, and fear that the distraction of the reality show may damage Glee. Adalian reported that the production team would still choose several winners from the entrants and <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> appear on Glee for at least one episode.
