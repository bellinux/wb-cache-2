40|$|The C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) is {{a forward}} {{chaining}} rule-based language. The requirements necessary for an expert system tool {{which is used}} for development, delivery, and training are examined. Because of <b>its</b> <b>high</b> <b>portability,</b> low cost, and ease of integration with external systems, CLIPS has great potential as an expert system tool for delivery and training. In addition, its representation flexibility, debugging aids, and performance, along with its other strengths, make it a viable alternative for expert system development...|$|R
40|$|The Virtual Immersive Learning (VIL) {{test bench}} {{implements}} a virtual collaborative immersive environment, capable of integrating natural contexts and typical gestures, which may occur during traditional lectures, enhanced with advanced experimental sessions. The system architecture is described, {{along with the}} motivations, and the most significant choices, both hardware and software, adopted <b>for</b> <b>its</b> implementation. The novelty of the approach essentially relies on its capability of embedding functionalities that stem from various research results (mainly carried out within the VICOM national project), and “putting the pieces together” in a well-integrated framework. These features, along with <b>its</b> <b>high</b> <b>portability,</b> good flexibility, and, above all, low cost, make this approach appropriate for educational and training purposes, mainly concerning measurements on telecommunication systems, at universities and research centers, as well as enterprises. Moreover, the methodology can be employed for remote access to and sharing of costly measurement equipment in many different activities. The immersive characteristics of the framework are illustrated, along with performance measurements related to a specific application...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{demonstration}} of an innovative coupled neutronic/themo-hydraulic tool, for which the models and algorithms were already presented in a com-panion report [1]. The novelty of the tool resides in its versatility, since many different systems can be investigated and different kinds of calculations can be performed. More precisely, both critical systems and subcritical systems with an external neutron source can be studied, and static and dynamic cases in the frequency domain (i. e. for stationary fluctuations) can be considered. For each situation, the three-dimensional distributions of the static neutron fluxes, all thermo-hydraulic parameters, their respective first-order noise are estimated, {{as well as the}} effective multiplication factor of the system. The main advantages of the tool, which is entirely MATLAB based, lie with the robustness of the implemented numerical algorithms, <b>its</b> <b>high</b> <b>portability</b> between different computer plat-forms and operative systems, and finally its ease of use since no input deck writing is required. The present version of the tool, which is based on two-group diffusion the-ory, is mostly suited to investigate thermal systems, both Pressurized and Boiling Wate...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to show our {{experience}} in the design of an extension to an XML native database in order to add in a native way version features. Due to the lineal nature of time, XML timestamped solutions for the management of XML versions have difficulty in supporting non-lineal ver-sioning, and their implementations are scarce and not very portable. From our technique described in [22, 23], which allows us to manage branch versioning, we have developed our versioning system focusing on <b>its</b> <b>high</b> <b>portability</b> and platform independence properties. To achieve this, our ver-sioning system is based exclusively on XML technology. The system is composed by XQuery modules, so that this allows its use not only in an XQuery engine but also in an XQuery-support XML native database. In order to test it, the mod-ules have been integrated in an eXist XML native database, an XML difference tool is used to observe the changes made between versions, and the eXist web interface has been ex-tended to make the management of XML versions easier...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide evasion from {{inland waters}} such as lakes, {{rivers and streams}} {{represents}} a significant component of the global carbon cycle, yet {{in many parts of}} the world, relatively little is known about its source. Radiocarbon dating of aquatic CO 2 has the potential to provide new insights into C cycling in the terrestrial–aquatic–atmosphere continuum, and whilst a range of methods are available for the collection of samples for 14 C analysis, they all have limitations or disadvantages (e. g. slow collection rates and potential non-equilibrium). These issues are further compounded in remote field sites. Here, we describe a new method for the field collection of CO 2 samples from low-pH waters (pH < 7) for radiocarbon analysis, which involves a scaled-up version of the widely used headspace equilibration technique coupled with syringe injection of samples into molecular sieve traps for convenient and stable storage. We present the results of laboratory and field tests to verify this ‘super headspace method’ and discuss its advantages compared with existing techniques, particularly for sampling in remote locations. This includes <b>its</b> <b>high</b> <b>portability,</b> speed of use and absence of any special sample preservation requirements...|$|R
