5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It {{was necessary to}} wait {{more than a year}} before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to stop Slobodan Milošević's Serbian-led {{crackdown}} on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma, while saying {{nothing in his}} memoirs about his personal role in the battles. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, 1847, he {{was wounded in the}} thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> flag to his friend, Lt. George E. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit.|$|E

5|$|Borsa's {{successor}} Ladislaus Kán went {{even further}} by usurping royal prerogative during his voivodeship between 1294 and 1315. He arbitrarily assumed {{the titles of}} count of Bistritz, Hermannstadt and the Székelys to expand his authority over Saxon and Székely communities exempted from voivodal authority. He set up a tax-collecting body, seemingly covering the entire province. He captured Otto of Bavaria, a claimant to the Hungarian throne and seized the Holy Crown of Hungary from {{him in the first}} half of 1307. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> royal diadem to King Charles I in 1310, but continued to rule Transylvania de facto independently until his death in 1315. His son of the same name declared himself voivode, a title even used by the monarch when referring to him in a charter of August 12, 1315. Dózsa Debreceni, the voivode King Charles I appointed in 1318, defeated some rebellious minor lords, but royal authority in Transylvania was only restored by Thomas Szécsényi in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{chaired the}} government's Industrial Development Advisory Board from 1973 to 1980. In this {{position}} {{he found himself}} frustrated by Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn's decision to ignore the board's advice and found workers' co-operative schemes at struggling firms Triumph Engineering and Fisher-Bendix in the early 1970s. Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post {{for more than a}} year before the company, beset with strikes, nationalised and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> chair to Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors in an attempt to get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the Land Rover name.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying to get ahead. This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E

25|$|The first {{succession}} came in 1943 when Joseph Gillain, {{known by}} the pen name Jijé, was given charge of the character. In 1944 Jijé introduced a new character, Fantasio, who would become Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer. Holding many artistic commitments at Spirou magazine, Jijé sought to delegate much of his work, and in 1946 <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> series to his understudy, the young André Franquin, {{in the middle of}} the production of the story Spirou et la maison préfabriquée.|$|E

After the battalion returned to Gallipoli <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> unit back to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Plugge on 20 November, and then took command of the Canterbury Battalion where he was confirmed as a substantive lieutenant colonel. Young was placed in charge of all New Zealand Infantry Brigade rear parties as the New Zealanders withdrew from the Gallipoli Peninsula {{in the early hours of}} the morning on 20 December 1915.|$|E

25|$|Anticipating a confrontation, legislators {{began to}} stake claims to key {{physical}} {{positions on the}} stage of the Legislative Palace in the days leading to December 1. On Tuesday, November 28, 2006, the members of the lower Chamber engaged in a confrontation as members of Calderón's PAN and López Obrador's PRD shoved each other off the stage. Later in the week, the impasse appeared to take a less hostile tone. As Fox's term came to an end at midnight on Thursday night, he held an unprecedented and largely symbolic ceremony in which <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> presidential sash and presidential residence over to Calderón.|$|E
25|$|He became {{coach of}} Warwickshire after the war, a {{position}} which he held {{until the end}} of 1955 and which saw the county win its second County Championship in 1951. He also umpired a few further first-class matches until 1953, mostly involving Warwickshire against non-county sides, such as Cambridge University or Combined Services. However, he continued to supervise the local indoor cricket school right up until the early 1970s when <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> reins over to younger personnel. He was always renowned for his fighting qualities {{both on and off the}} cricket field and for his razor-sharp sense of humour which made him popular throughout his association with the game of cricket.|$|E
25|$|He {{initially}} nationalized foreign-owned {{firms and}} forced European investors {{out of the}} country. In many cases <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> management of these firms to relatives and close associates who stole the companies' assets. This precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced by 1977 to try to woo foreign investors back. Katangan rebels based in Angola invaded Zaire in 1977 in retaliation for Mobutu's support for anti-MPLA rebels. France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan paratroopers into the country and repulsed the rebels, ending Shaba I. The rebels attacked Zaire again, in greater numbers, in the Shaba II invasion of 1978. The governments of Belgium and France deployed troops with logistical support from the United States and defeated the rebels again.|$|E

25|$|Vanderbilt {{eventually}} had to {{sell his}} ferry service to Law after a franchise battle. After the battle, Vanderbilt lost interest in the transit operations on Staten Island and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> operations of the ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob H. Vanderbilt, who {{was the president of}} the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law's ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company. In 1865, the railway took over the operation of the New York & Richmond Ferry Company and would later assume direct responsibility for operating the ferry service to Manhattan too. Under the leadership of Jacob Vanderbilt, the Staten Island Rail Road took over the Perth Amboy Ferry and the Staten Island Ferry, and train service was increased.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Mick McCarthy, Robson emerged in January 2003 as the bookmakers' favourite to become the new Republic of Ireland manager, but the job went instead to Brian Kerr. In November 2003 Robson was set to become Nigeria's national coach, but the appointment was blocked by the Nigerian sports minister due to doubts that Robson's wage demands could be met. Later that month, Robson did make his football comeback—more {{than two years after}} leaving Middlesbrough—when he accepted the manager's job with Division One strugglers Bradford City. Robson won his first game in charge as Bradford fought back from 2–0 down to beat Millwall 3–2. But he recorded just six more wins as Bradford took only 22 points from 27 games under Robson and were relegated in 23rd position. Robson's short-term contract was not renewed and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> reins over to his assistant Colin Todd.|$|E
25|$|The battles {{continued}} to rage behind the leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and was right behind Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also going through, this time doing the job cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new set of tyres and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E

25|$|The Staten Island Railway {{opened in}} stages in 1860. It was {{necessary}} to have a direct connection between the new railroad trains and the infrequent ferries to and from Manhattan, but {{this turned out to}} be difficult during the beginning of operation. The ferries serving Vanderbilt's Landing were owned by George Law, who operated the rival New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry. Afterwards, Vanderbilt tried to operate a ferry service between Manhattan and Staten Island that would compete with the ferry service owned by Law. Vanderbilt started construction on his plan for a central dock on the island, but he abandoned the scheme after a storm destroyed the timber work. Only the large stone foundation remained; this was still visible in 1900 at low tide. A long franchise battle ensued, resulting in Vanderbilt selling his ferry service to Law in 1862. Vanderbilt subsequently lost interest in the transit operations on Staten Island and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> operations of the ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob Vanderbilt, who was the president of the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law's ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company.
