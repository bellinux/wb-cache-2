5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used <b>in</b> <b>solving</b> <b>the</b> structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E
