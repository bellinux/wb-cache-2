5|$|A shock came on 6 February, when Bill Shankly's Workington {{earned a}} 2–0 win at Borough Park – {{the only time}} in the season Vale lost by more than one goal. Seven days later Scunthorpe & Lindsey United left Vale Park with a point as the home side came close to finding the net on {{numerous}} occasions without success despite one shot from Hayward partially injuring goalkeeper Norman Malan after he struck the ball <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> Malan's jaw. Following this short run of poor form they next recorded a win against York City, securing a 1–0 victory at Bootham Crescent. On 27 February, Chesterfield became the first away side to score at Vale Park since September, as they fought back from a two-goal deficit to win a point. Vale had previously conceded just one goal in 20 home games over an 11-month period, and had last conceded twice in a home league game on 30 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his {{success as a}} pinch hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and a pinch runner.|$|E
25|$|By {{this stage}} of her career, Ronstadt had {{established}} her niche {{in the field of}} country-rock. Along with other musicians such as the Flying Burrito Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Swampwater, Neil Young, and the Eagles, she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> singing more rock and roll.|$|E

25|$|Earnhardt started 8th in the Budweiser Shootout, led {{for several}} laps, and {{finished}} 20th after being {{caught up in}} a six-car crash on lap 55 that also involved Matt Kenseth, Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick. In the Gatorade Duel, Earnhardt performed strong, starting on the outside pole in the first duel race. He led a few laps {{in the early part of}} the race before finishing second to Tony Stewart after his Nationwide Series teammate Danica Patrick smashed <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the inside wall in a last lap crash on the back straightaway. In the postponed Daytona 500, he finished in 2nd place behind Matt Kenseth, after passing Greg Biffle on the last lap. At Phoenix, Earnhardt's car struggled most of the race and came out with a 14th-place finish.|$|E
25|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was closely fought, with many drivers vying {{for a place}} in Q3 by only a few hundredths of a second, and the exact running order was only resolved in the final few seconds when Pastor Maldonado spun at the final chicane and glanced against the outer wall. Maldonado pushed too <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the chicane. He managed to keep his car from ploughing into the outer wall, but damaged his right rear wheel and suspension and ultimately finished seventeenth. Romain Grosjean narrowly avoided elimination, but his teammate Kimi Räikkönen finished twelfth, behind Kamui Kobayashi. Despite setting the early pace, Nico Hülkenberg qualified thirteenth, with Daniel Ricciardo alongside him in fourteenth, a full second quicker than teammate Vergne. Sergio Pérez was fifteenth, admitting to having locked up his front tyres at the hairpin on his final flying lap. Bruno Senna qualified sixteenth overall, narrowly ahead of Maldonado.|$|E

25|$|After scoring 100 not out for Gloucestershire's Second XI in 1964, Shepherd had a {{reasonably}} successful, though late-starting, first class playing career for Gloucestershire, stretching from 1965 to 1979, {{and though he}} never came close to international selection he was popular both with his team-mates and the Gloucestershire supporters. He started with a bang, scoring 108 on debut against Oxford University in April 1965, and made eleven more hundreds over the years, though only twice (in 1969 and 1975) did he average over 30. Mainly a middle-order batsman, and never the slimmest of men even in his younger days, he relied more on his fine shot placement than speed across the ground, and his bowling was almost non-existent: he took only two wickets in his entire first-class career. One famous incident at the Gloucestershire Cricket Club saw Shepherd hitting the ball so <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the crowd that it knocked out a spectator reading a newspaper. The spectator was taken to hospital and recovered with only minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana, Ortiz faced former title {{challenger}} Lamont Peterson on December 11 at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. Peterson {{went down}} {{for the first time}} from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch and he grabbed on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. But when the fight resumed, Ortiz was on Peterson again and knocked him <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the ropes, which held him up and caused referee Vic Drakulich to call the second knockdown of the round with about 30 seconds to go. One judge who brought his own juicer with him scored the bout a win for Peterson and the other two remaining judges scoring the bout a draw; the fight will go down on record as a draw. This was despite those who were in attendance saying that Ortiz clearly won the fight.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1994, Shamrock {{returned}} to the octagon at UFC 3 in an event that was marketed by the UFC as the ultimate rematch between two-time champion Royce Gracie and #1 contender Shamrock. Shamrock's first fight, now allowed to wear his shoes, was against top ranked judo practitioner Christophe Leininger. Leininger engaged for a takedown, but Shamrock blocked and got on top, unloading hard punches and headbutts until the tap out. Shamrock crossed faced Leininger so <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the mat that Leininger admitted to being knocked out for a second, and he later was revealed to have suffered a mild concussion. Shamrock's next fight was in the semifinals against kickboxer Felix Mitchell. Shamrock took Mitchell down and forced him to tap out due to a rear naked choke. With this win, Shamrock advanced to the finals of UFC 3. However, Shamrock refused {{to compete in the}} finals after he learned Gracie had dropped out of the tournament after his win over Kimo Leopoldo, combined with a knee injury he suffered during his match with Leininger.|$|E

500|$|Friday's {{technical}} ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike. The Reading Evening Post report of Reading's 4–1 victory over Exeter City on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as a professional, described his performance as [...] "sheer magic" [...] as he scored twice. The report also called Friday's first {{goal of the}} day [...] "glorious": he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the opposite corner {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing shin pads, and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue.|$|E
500|$|After a 37-minute {{red flag}} period, the race resumed; Gordon {{was able to}} hold off his challengers over the final three laps to take his {{eleventh}} win of the season.

Valls was then able to put in his own attack and pass Van Garderen in the final part of the stage, going on to win by five seconds. It was his first victory in five years and gave him a 19-second lead in the overall standings. Van Garderen was frustrated after the stage, having also finished second on the same stage in the 2014 race behind Chris Froome. He said afterwards that he had [...] "underestimated" [...] Valls, who had not been considered among the favourites for stage victory.|$|E
500|$|On 3 September 1944, Emil Lang {{was killed}} in action when his Fw 190 A-8 (Werknummer 171 240—factory number) [...] "Green 1" [...] hit the ground and {{exploded}} in a field at Overhespen. He had experienced mechanical trouble on the runway when {{he and the other}} aircraft of his flight took off at Melsbroek at 1.20 pm. Ten minutes later, Lang was still having difficulties raising his landing gear. Flying at an altitude of , his wingman, Unteroffizier Hans-Joachim Borreck, called out P-47 Thunderbolts to their rear. Lang broke upward, to the left. Leutnant Alfred Groß saw Lang's Fw190 diving in flames, its gear extended, but he lost sight of Lang when his own craft was hit and he had to bail out. Examination of both German and American records suggests that Borreck and Groß misidentified their opponents. The P-51 Mustangs of the 55th Fighter Group's 338th Squadron intercepted a flight of three to six Focke Wulfs. Lieutenant Darrell Cramer took a high deflection shot at the Focke Wulf on the left, which fell upside down in a steep dive and crashed <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the ground; this undoubtedly was Emil Lang.|$|E
500|$|This late-season {{competition}} for the AL Central title included a four-game series between the two teams from September 29 to October 2. The series, played at the Tigers' home field Comerica Park, started with a day-night doubleheader caused by a rainout the night before when the series was scheduled to start. The {{final game of the}} series featured moments of contention between the two teams. In the third inning, Nate Robertson hit Denard Span. Minnesota starter Scott Baker hit Marcus Thames with a pitch the next inning. Thames responded by sliding <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> second base to break up a potential double play that inning. Twins' reliever Jose Mijares then threw behind the Tigers' Adam Everett in the eighth inning. Umpire Angel Hernandez warned Mijares and the Tigers bench, Tigers' manager Jim Leyland argued with Hernandez, and he was ejected. Despite the warning Minnesota's Delmon Young was hit in the knee with the first pitch in the ninth inning by Jeremy Bonderman. Bonderman was immediately ejected as was Tigers' catcher Gerald Laird who argued with Hernandez and the benches cleared, though there was no brawl. Bonderman was suspended for three games, and Tigers' hitting coach Lloyd McClendon—who had been acting as manager following Leyland's ejection—was suspended for a game. [...] McClendon, Leyland, and Laird were all fined.|$|E

500|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops began on lap 199; Johnson stopped on lap 203, while Earnhardt made a pit stop on the {{following}} lap. After the pit stops, Kahne retook the lead. Johnson drove to the track's inside at turn three and passed Kahne for the lead on lap 211 and started {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field. Bowyer drove to his garage on lap 216 for a transmission change because he lost the use of third gear. Jeff Gordon had closed the gap to Kahne by lap 229. Green-flag pit stops started six laps later when Kahne made a pit stop from second place. Johnson took on four tires at his stop on lap 239, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon, who ceded it to Earnhardt two laps later. Martin's pit crew dropped a lug nut which resulted him remaining stationary for 21.7 seconds. Burton stalled his car which required his crew to push him to the end of pit road. An eighth caution was triggered on lap 242 when Yeley attempted to drive down pit road, and Martin was approaching him. Martin tried to avoid Yeley by steering left onto the turn four apron but made contact with him. Martin then spun and went <b>hard</b> <b>into</b> the tri-oval wall; his car got airborne in the process. Robby Gordon could not avoid the melee and hit Yeley. Gordon consequently spun into the front stretch grass but continued.|$|E
