5|$|Later, {{while at}} home, the Smoking Man {{receives}} an urgent {{phone call from}} <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat,</b> who meets him {{near the site of}} a UFO wreck. An alien from the UFO is alive. <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> and Smoking Man reminisce about the multiple times they changed the course of history. They flip a coin over who is tasked to kill the alien survivor. <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> loses, and thus reluctantly shoots the alien.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season of The X-Files, <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> {{provided}} Mulder and Scully with information {{they would have been}} otherwise unable to obtain. As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he {{was in a position to}} know a great deal of information. <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{has made}} a name for himself working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is {{appointed}} a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.|$|E

Mulder initially believes that Druce's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO, but discovers that Deep Throat's photo is a fake. When Mulder confronts <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat,</b> he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine. He also divulges that the truck is being used to transport an extraterrestrial biological entity, or E.B.E., that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site.

5|$|Series creator Chris Carter, {{who called}} the episode one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, created the episode as a way to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father.

Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial black oil with which he was infected three years previously; because he is infected with the virus, Mulder is proof of alien life. Skinner, who has been looking for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed {{him out of the}} hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to an unfamiliar neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> (Jerry Hardin). <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the Syndicate, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same.

5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduced}} main {{characters of the}} series, including Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, and recurring characters <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat,</b> Walter Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man.

5|$|At FBI headquarters, Scully meets a man {{who appears}} to be Smith, who has come to turn himself in.

5|$|Boys in the Sand is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys in the Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat</b> by nearly a year.|$|E

Despite this result, Regusters' conclusions about this tape were later challenged by Mackal, who asserted that the Mokèlé-mbèmbé did not have a vocal call.

5000|$|In February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news {{columnist}} John Dean, {{reported that}} Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that [...] "Deep Throat" [...] was ailing and that Bradlee had written <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat's</b> obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of The Washington Post, Leonard Downie, denied these claims. Felt {{was something of}} a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999.

5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat,</b> Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat,</b> who {{explains}} that the COS is an artificial intelligence developed by Wilczek, and that the Department of Defense is trying to acquire it.

Scully doesn't accept Mulder's belief that the COS is sentient, but later discovers the machine hacking into her computer. She joins Mulder at the Eurisko Building to help him destroy the machine.|$|E
5|$|The venue {{became an}} adult cinema in the 1970s.

However, the rise of video cassettes and cable television led to a decline in cinema attendance, and by the 2000s, the Maizels family had sold all of their properties except for the Oregon Theatre. Gayne Maizels still owns the theater, which continues to operate as the city's longest running pornographic cinema.|$|E

After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation.

5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat.</b> In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

2500|$|Speculation about Felt's {{motives for}} leaking has varied widely as well. Some {{suggested}} that it was revenge for Nixon's choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI. Political scientist George Friedman argued that: [...] "The Washington Post created a morality play about an out-of-control government brought to heel by two young, enterprising journalists and a courageous newspaper. That simply wasn't what happened. Instead, {{it was about the}} FBI using The Washington Post to leak information to destroy the president, and The Washington Post willingly serving as the conduit for that information while withholding an essential dimension of the story by concealing <b>Deep</b> <b>Throat's</b> identity." ...|$|R
