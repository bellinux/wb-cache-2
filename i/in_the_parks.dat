5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks.</b> Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
