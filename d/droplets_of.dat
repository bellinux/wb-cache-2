5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).|$|E
5|$|In a 2016 study, a {{team from}} Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research {{announced}} that the main cause for mass extinction was a severe drop in global temperatures caused by concentrations of large amount of <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Freezing temperatures lasted {{for at least three}} years.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E

5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E
5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That {{is to say that}} when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E
5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when {{the two sides of}} its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} jetting a <b>droplet</b> <b>of</b> an electrically conductive fluid. In the method, a Lorentz force is generated in the electrically conductive fluid. The Lorentz force is directed into an actuation direction. The actuation direction is a direction opposite to the droplet ejection direction. The present invention further relates to a jetting device for printing a <b>droplet</b> <b>of</b> an electrically conductive fluid...|$|R

5|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis, {{commonly}} known as the Mt. Baker waxy cap, the brown almond waxy cap or the tawny almond waxy cap, is a species of fungus in the Hygrophoraceae family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy cap is brown in the center and cream to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 2,000fragments of lead were found, 940of {{which were}} <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> melted metal, {{some of these}} being a {{consequence}} of the fire in 1236. One of the earliest artefacts was a papal bulla dating from the rule of Pope Clement III (1187–91). Two other possible seals were discovered. A total of 15lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in leaded windows), ventilator grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17thcentury. Another find was a small gemstone, a cabochon (polished) sardonyx.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E

5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains <b>droplets</b> <b>of</b> beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
