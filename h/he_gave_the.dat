5000|$|Several non-Jewish authors share Wiesel's {{concerns}} about God's nature, including Salman Rushdie (The Satanic Verses, Shalimar the Clown) and Anne Provoost (In the Shadow of the Ark): Why would you trust a God that doesn't <b>give</b> us <b>the</b> right book?

Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region.

5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters.

Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
