50|$|Although {{the genus}} Pantholops is {{currently}} monotypic, a fossil species, P. hundesiensis, is {{known from the}} Pleistocene of Tibet. It was slightly smaller than the living species, with a narrower skull. In addition, the fossil genus Qurliqnoria, from the Miocene of China, {{is thought to be}} an early member of the Pantholopinae, which diverged from the <b>goat-antelopes</b> around this time.|$|R
60|$|The most {{interesting}} and suggestive feature connected with these Formosan mammals is the identity or affinity {{of several of}} them, with Indian or Malayan rather than with Chinese species. We have the rock-monkey of Formosa allied to the rhesus monkeys of India and Burma, not to those of South China and Hainan. The tree civet (Helictis subaurantiaca), and the small flying squirrel (Sciuropterus kaleensis), are both allied to Himalayan species. Swinhoe's deer and <b>goat-antelope</b> are nearest to Malayan species, as are the red and white-breasted flying squirrels; while the fruit-bat, the wild pig, {404} and the spotted deer are all allied to peculiar Japanese species. The clouded tiger is a Malay species unknown in China, while the Asiatic wild cat {{is a native of}} the Himalayas and Malacca. It is clear, therefore, that before Formosa was separated from the mainland the above named animals or their ancestral types must have ranged over the intervening country as far as the Himalayas on the west, Japan on the north, and Borneo or the Philippines on the south; and that after that event occurred, the conditions were so materially changed as to lead to the extinction of these species in what are now the coast provinces of China, while they or their modified descendants continued to exist in the dense forests of the Himalayas and the Malay Islands, and in such detached islands as Formosa and Japan. We will now see what additional light is thrown upon this subject by an examination of the birds.|$|E

5000|$|The Tibetan {{antelope}} is {{the sole}} species in the genus Pantholops, named from the Greek for [...] "all antelope". It was formerly classified in the Antilopinae subfamily, but morphological and molecular evidence led to it being placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae, closely allied to <b>goat-antelopes</b> of the subfamily Caprinae.

40|$|There {{is not a}} {{consensus}} on classification of musk deer. Nowak (1991) includes Moschus in the family Cervidae (true deer), but suggests that the genus may warrant its own separate family. Zhiwotschenko (1990) places musk deer in a subfamily (Moschinae) of true deer, while MacDonald (1995) and Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) give musk deer full family status (Moschidae). Green and Kattel (1997) report that Moschus comprise a separate family, somewhere between the Mouse Deer (Tragulidae) and the Cervoids (<b>goat-antelopes</b> and true deer). This is due to having both “primitive” ruminant characteristics such as tusks and an absence of antlers, and more advanced features such as a four-chambered stomach. Unlike {{other members of the}} Cervidae, musk deer have gall bladders. Sokolov and Prikhod’ko (1997) consider all musk deer differences to be subspecific as they are karyologically monotypic...|$|R
50|$|Two {{orders of}} mammals, the colugos (2 species) and {{treeshrews}} (19 species), are endemic to the Indomalaya ecozone, as are families Craseonycteridae (Kitti's hog-nosed bat), Diatomyidae, Platacanthomyidae, Tarsiidae (tarsiers) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). Large mammals characteristic of Indomalaya include the Asiatic lions, tigers, wild Asian water buffalos, Asian elephant, Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, Malayan tapir. The other endemic Asian families include Ursidae (giant panda), Calomyscidae (mouse-like hamsters) and Ailuridae (red pandas). The Asian ungulates include bharal, gaur, blackbuck, the wild yak and the Tibetan antelope, four-horned antelope, ox-sheep (Ovibovini), takin, kting voar, {{several species of}} muntjac, Bubalus and others. The <b>goat-antelopes</b> (Rupicaprini) are represented by the goral and the serow. Asia's tropical forests accommodate one of the world's three principal primate communities, about 45 species including lorises, tarsiers, leaf-eating langurs, the orangutan of Borneo and Sumatra, and the gibbons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountain}} goat is an {{even-toed ungulate}} {{of the order}} Artiodactyla and the family Bovidae that includes antelopes, gazelles, and cattle. It belongs to the subfamily Caprinae (<b>goat-antelopes),</b> along with 32 other species including true goats, sheep, the chamois, and the muskox. Notably, the takins of the Himalayan region, while not a sister lineage of the mountain goat, are nonetheless very closely related and almost coeval; they and the mountain goat are a case of parallel evolution from an ancestral goat. Other {{members of this group}} are the Pseudois [...] "blue sheep", the true goats and the Himalayan tahr. The chamois and true sheep lineages are also very closely related, while the muskoxen lineage is somewhat more distant. The mountain goats probably diverged from their relatives in the late Tortonian, some 7.5 to 8 million years ago.|$|R

2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl {{is perhaps}} the only living owl widely {{reported}} (if not commonly) to kill the young of ungulates. At least nine species {{have been identified as}} their food. It is possible that some ungulates are eaten as carrion but this species, like most owls, normally kills its own food, unlike many eagles many of which consume carrion regularly. Among the ungulate prey recorded are three species of deer and five species of <b>goat-antelopes,</b> in addition to piglets of wild boar (Sus scrofa).

5000|$|The {{subfamily}} Caprinae are ruminants, {{consisting of}} mostly medium-sized bovids. its members also {{are known as}} caprids. The domestic sheep and goats have both been well known in China. Other Caprinae known in China are types called [...] "antelopes", or [...] "goat-antelopes" [...] since they are not true antelopes (a true antelope is a bovid with a cervid-like or antilocaprid-like morphology). Most <b>goat-antelopes</b> are gregarious and have fairly stocky builds. The lifestyles of caprids fall into two broad classes: 'resource-defenders', which are territorial and defend a small, food-rich area against {{other members of the}} same species; and 'grazers', which gather together into herds and roam freely over a larger, usually relatively infertile area. Species in the area of China include the urial (Ovis orientalis) which occupies a largely infertile area from Kashmir to Iran, including much desert country characteristic of the historic Western Regions. The European mouflon (Ovis musimon) is thought to be the ancestor of the modern domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and was historically herded by the Xiong Nu, and other population groups located in or near China. The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. Another species historically found wild in parts of China include the serow and the goral.|$|R
