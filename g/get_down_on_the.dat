2500|$|According to {{testimony}} {{offered on}} behalf of the prosecution, several minutes later the group of four men decided to rob the three, with Winfrey testifying that Gray said he [...] "felt like hurting somebody." [...] They returned and Gray told Cummins that [...] "This is a robbery. <b>Get</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground." [...] The two girls were grabbed and held on the ground. Richardson held Julie down while Clemons raped her and then the two swapped positions. Gray, Richardson, and Clemons then alternately raped Robin and Julie. Cummins was then robbed of his wallet, wristwatch, cash, and keys, and the three victims were forced down the manhole cover to the concrete pier. The two Kerry sisters then were pushed, and Cummins jumped as instructed. Medical witnesses testified that Cummins and Julie Kerry survived the [...] fall to the water below. Cummins testified that after surfacing, the current pulled him over to Julie, but then she drifted off after he began to drown. Cummins swam to shore and survived. The body of Julie Kerry was found three weeks later near Caruthersville, Missouri; the body of Robin Kerry was not found.|$|E

60|$|What {{struck the}} ship-keeper most was the absent, unseeing {{expression}} of the captain, striding after the girl. He passed him, the ship-keeper, without notice, without an order, {{without so much as}} a look. The captain had never done so before. Always had a nod and a pleasant word for a man. From this slight the ship-keeper drew a conclusion unfavourable to the strange girl. He gave them time to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wharf before crossing the deck to steal one more look at the pair over the rail. The captain took hold of the girl's arm just before a couple of railway trucks drawn by a horse came rolling along and hid them from the ship-keeper's sight for good.|$|E

25|$|The primary work {{is between}} mother and therapist. It is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> notion of the infant as {{initiator}} in infant–parent psychotherapy. For half the session <b>the</b> mother <b>gets</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor with the infant, observes it and interacts only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|R

But I don't know if you are aware that his family are all Plungers, and that he is himself tainted with the wicked heresy of that sect. So it is. He is, as one might say in secular metaphor, 'on the fence' between their grievous error and the pure faith of your church.

60|$|There {{could be}} a {{relation}} to familiar things that was astounding in its revelation. To get off a horse that had tortured her, to discover an almost insatiable appetite, to rest weary, aching body before the genial warmth of a beautiful fire--these were experiences which Carley found to have been hitherto unknown delights. It struck her suddenly and strangely that to know the real truth about anything in life might require infinite experience and understanding. How could one feel immense gratitude and relief, or the delight of satisfying acute hunger, or the sweet comfort of rest, unless there had been circumstances of extreme contrast? She had been compelled to suffer cruelly on horseback {{in order to make}} her appreciate how good it was to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Otherwise she never would have known. She wondered, then, how true that principle might be in all experience. It gave strong food for thought. There were things in the world never before dreamed of in her philosophy.|$|E

Your bark could be heard {{throughout}} the land. Well, what did this handful of pale- faces? It drove your fathers before them, until they got all the best of the hunting-grounds. Not an Injin of you all, now, ever <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shores of the great salt lake, unless to sell brooms and baskets, and then he goes sneaking like a wolf after a sheep. You have forgotten how clams and oysters taste. Your fathers had as many of them as they could eat; but not one of YOU ever tasted them. The pale-faces eat them all. If an Injin asked for one, they would throw the shell at his head, and call him a dog.|$|E

60|$|Washington, Monday forenoon, Dec. 29, 1862. DEAR, DEAR MOTHER--Friday the 19th inst. I {{succeeded in}} {{reaching}} the camp of the 51st New York, and found George[1] alive and well. In {{order to make}} sure that you would get the good news, I sent back by messenger to Washington a telegraphic dispatch (I dare say you did not get it for some time) as well as a letter--and the same to Hannah[2] at Burlington. I have staid in camp with George ever since, till yesterday, when I came back to Washington, about the 24th. George got Jeff's[3] letter of the 20th. Mother, how much you must have suffered, all that week, till George's letter came--and all the rest must too. As to me, I know I put in about three days of the greatest suffering I ever experienced in my life. I wrote to Jeff how I had my pocket picked in a jam and hurry, changing cars, at Philadelphia--so that I landed here without a dime. The next two days I spent hunting through the hospitals, walking day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information--trying to get access to big people, etc.--I could not get the least clue to anything. Odell would not see me at all. But Thursday afternoon, I lit on a way to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Government boat that runs to Aquia creek, and so by railroad to the neighborhood of Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburg--so by degrees I worked my way to Ferrero's[4] brigade, which I found Friday afternoon without much trouble after I got in camp. When I found dear brother George, and found that he was alive and well, O you may imagine how trifling all my little cares and difficulties seemed--they vanished into nothing. And now that I have lived for eight or nine days amid such scenes as the camps furnish, and had a practical part in it all, and realize the way that hundreds of thousands of good men are now living, and have had to live for a year or more, not only without any of the comforts, but with death and sickness and hard marching and hard fighting (and no success at that) for their continual experience--really nothing we call trouble seems worth talking about. One of the first things that met my eyes in camp was a heap of feet, arms, legs, etc., under a tree in front of a hospital, the Lacy house.|$|E
