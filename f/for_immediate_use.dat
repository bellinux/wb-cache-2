5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, they spread their pincers {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use.</b> Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E

5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E

25|$|Because {{unsaturated}} alanes are oxygen- and moisture-sensitive, {{they are}} most often prepared <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> without isolation. However, the method of preparation determines {{the configuration of the}} intermediate unsaturated alane, which {{is directly related to the}} configuration of the product (transfer of the alkenyl group occurs with retention of configuration). Thus, an understanding of available hydroalumination methods is important for the study of reactions of unsaturated alanes. This second describes the most common methods of hydroalumination, and subsequent chemical reactions that the resulting alkenylalanes may undergo.|$|E
25|$|Once {{separated}} from the stalks, the grain was used {{in a number of}} ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use.</b> Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make gruel and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.|$|E
25|$|When first purchased, most bats are {{not ready}} <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> and require knocking-in to allow the soft fibres to strike a hard new cricket ball without causing damage to the bat, and {{allowing}} full power {{to be transferred to}} the shot. Knocking-in involves striking the surface with an old cricket ball or a special mallet. This compacts the soft fibres within the bat and reduces the risk of the bat snapping. The bat may also need raw linseed oil, which fills in the gaps between the fibres.|$|E

25|$|Since Android {{devices are}} usually battery-powered, Android is {{designed}} to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with {{those that have been}} inactive for longest. Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killers were doing more harm than good.|$|E
25|$|Luas {{tickets are}} sold at newsagents and other shops, mostly in the {{vicinity}} of Luas stops. Joint Luas and Dublin Bus tickets can be purchased from Luas vending machines <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use,</b> as well as from Dublin Bus ticket agents. Tickets bought at Dublin Bus agents must be validated on a bus before being valid for a tram (since Luas does not use ticket validation systems upon boarding the tram). Certain tickets are cheaper in shops than at ticket machines. Tickets cannot be purchased on board the trams.|$|E
25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local codes of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E

A and B were stored {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters, on either side of number1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Shorthand {{was used}} more widely in the past, before the {{invention}} of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered {{an essential part of}} secretarial training and police work, as well as useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes are typically temporary, intended either <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> or for later typing, data entry, or (mainly historically) transcription to longhand, although longer term uses do exist, such as encipherment: diaries (like that of the famous Samuel Pepys) being a common example.|$|E
25|$|In June 1949, the House Committee on Armed Services {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} charges, emanating unofficially from Navy sources, of malfeasance in office against Secretary Johnson and Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington. The hearings also looked into the capability of the B-36, the cancellation of the supercarrier United States and JCS procedures on weapons development, and ultimately examined the whole course of unification. In addition to disparaging the B-36, Navy representatives questioned the current U.S. military plan <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use</b> of atomic weapons against large urban areas when a war started. The Navy argued that such an approach would not harm military targets, and that tactical air power, ground troops, and sea power were the elements necessary to defend the United States and Europe against attack. The Air Force countered that atomic weapons and long-range strategic bombers would deter war, but that if war nevertheless broke out, an immediate atomic offensive against the enemy would {{contribute to the success}} of surface actions and reduce U.S. casualties. Strategic bombing, the Air Force contended, provided the major counterbalance to the Soviet Union's vastly superior ground forces.|$|E

500|$|The new battery was {{constructed}} during 1799 on marshy ground {{a short distance}} south-east of St Catherine's Church. It took {{its name from the}} nearby Coalhouse Point, which was named for a coal wharf that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year. It was equipped with four 24-pounder (pdr.) cannon mounted on traversing carriages, which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional garrison carriages. The battery faced the river with a semi-circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted. A walled-off area to the rear enclosed a barracks, magazine and shot kiln (for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire). The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water-filled ditch. It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine where ammunition was stored <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>use.</b> The French did not test the Thames defences, despite an invasion scare in 1804, and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon's final defeat in 1815.|$|E
