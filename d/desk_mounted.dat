50|$|The {{resulting}} designs {{followed the}} English model, but differed in its more {{extensive use of}} asymmetry, which had been a growing aspect of English furniture since the work of Edward William Godwin had become popular. He often used asymmetry to advantage, for example combining several pieces of furniture into one unit, such as an open bookcase over a slant-front <b>desk</b> <b>mounted</b> on a chest of drawers flanked on one side by a low cupboard.|$|E
50|$|To {{accompany}} the new look, BBC World swapped sets with BBC News 24, so that BBC World now used thusemall newsroom {{that had been}} used previously by News 24.

50|$|Nameplates {{are usually}} sold as two {{separate}} components: the manufactured nameplate insert and the nameplate holder. This setup allows the nameplate insert {{to be used}} {{in a variety of settings}} depending on the specific holder—the same plastic, wood, or metal nameplate insert can usually be removed and reinserted into another holder style with minimal effort; thereby creating a new nameplate application. Various nameplate holders range from wall and door <b>mounts,</b> <b>desk</b> holders, to cubicle hangers.|$|R

50|$|All masking {{systems are}} {{composed}} of several basic components. The primary component {{is the source of}} one or more random electrical signals. Typically the source may create either pink or white noise. These particular spectra are seldom acceptable to listeners when converted to masking sound, so a spectrum equalizer is needed to create the proper sound spectrum a listener hears. Most professionals recommend the equalizer cover at least the speech frequency range from 160 Hz to 8000 Hz in 1/3 octave bands; most products cover a broader range. Auxiliary signals, such a paging and music, can be added from an outside source. Those electrical signals are seldom proper when converted to sound, so a more limited spectrum equalizer should be added. All signals are added in a mixer to set their relative levels and then sent to one or more power amplifiers. From the amplifiers, the mixed signal is sent to devices that control the overall level in various areas called zones and thence to either loudspeakers or vibration devices to create sound.Many newer masking systems enclose all components up to the amplifier in one reasonably small cabinet, which can be rack, shelf, or <b>desk</b> <b>mounted.</b> There may be more than one of each component in any system and than one system in a large facility. Most recent system designs have incorporated the ability to control many of the components by software, either locally or remotely. See the dashed lines in the figure. The advantage of such controls lies in the simplicity with which the settings of the various components can be altered. The disadvantage is the added cost to add these controls, especially if system changes are infrequently required.|$|E
50|$|An unwelcome side-effect of {{the modern}} {{lightweight}} materials used on these and all later models was that the handsets were too light. Not only did they not reliably hold down the tiny micro-switch, which now served as the switchhook, but users {{did not like the}} feel of them. They felt like 'toys'. They lacked 'gravitas'. This was addressed by the simple inclusion of a steel bar in the handle of the handset to give it weight and make it feel a 'serious' piece of equipment. The telephones could be <b>desk</b> or wall <b>mounted</b> without any modification.|$|R
50|$|These {{telephones}} {{are able}} to operate on both loop-disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (tone) and a switch {{on the base of}} the telephone chooses the method. The volume of the ringer could also be changed to High, Low or Off ('off' did not actually disconnect the bell but merely locked the clapper in position so that it could not strike the bells). The Relate is shown on the left, the React has a squarer styling, without the pen-holder tray. Note also that {{on the underside of the}} Relate there is a mount that can be fitted in two positions. One makes it a <b>desk</b> telephone and <b>mounting</b> it the other way round turns it into a wall telephone - very ingenious. On the React, the only modification required, for wall mounting, is the reversal of a tiny tab, in the receiver recess. This prevents the handset falling on the floor. A similar tab is molded onto the top of the case, to provide an 'Off Hook' parking position.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{the first}} time, this paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of the}} performance of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 low power, low data rate wireless standard in relation to medical sensor body area networks. This is an emerging application of wireless sensor networking with particular performance constraints, including power consumption, physical size, robustness and security. In the analysis presented, the star network configuration of the 802. 15. 4 standard at 2. 4 GHz was considered for a body area network consisting of a wearable or <b>desk</b> <b>mounted</b> coordinator outside of the body with up to 10 body implanted sensors. The main consideration in this work was the long-term power consumption of devices, since for practical reasons, implanted medical devices and sensors must function for at least 10 to 15 years without battery replacement. The results show that when properly configured, 802. 15. 4 can be used for medical sensor networking when configured in non-beacon mode with low data rate asymmetric traffic. Beacon mode may also be used, but with more severe restrictions on data rate and crystal tolerance.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{document}} is {{an investigation into}} the tools and processes used by artists and designers to convert their mental ideas into three dimensional space. Limiting itself to the field of sculptures using the human figure as the central subject, this research covers the techniques and tools used and the potential for recent engineering technologies to offer some advantage. The paper makes two major assertions: that a number of identifiable criteria are used by artists to control the forming of space, and that the recent emergence of haptic devices and additive fabrication may offer a relief from the constraints of some of these criteria. The research involves the creation of artworks using two separate sculpting techniques and cross analysing the processes used and the results being produced. The first sculptural technique involves organic clays formed using manual hand tools, compared to the second technique of utilising computer generated virtual clays formed using specific software applications and a <b>desk</b> <b>mounted</b> haptic feedback device as substitute for the manual tools. The research concluded with an exhibition of the works created and the submission of this exegesis...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{validate}} a new miniaturised, open-field wavefront device {{which has}} been developed with the capacity to be attached to an ophthalmic surgical microscope or slit-lamp. SETTING: Solihull Hospital and Aston University, Birmingham, UK DESIGN: Comparative non-interventional study. METHODS: The dynamic range of the Aston Aberrometer was assessed using a calibrated model eye. The validity of the Aston Aberrometer was compared to a conventional <b>desk</b> <b>mounted</b> Shack-Hartmann aberrometer (Topcon KR 1 W) by measuring the refractive error and higher order aberrations of 75 dilated eyes with both instruments in random order. The Aston Aberrometer measurements were repeated five times to assess intra-session repeatability. Data was converted to vector form for analysis. RESULTS: The Aston Aberrometer had a large dynamic range of at least + 21. 0 D to - 25. 0 D. It gave similar measurements to a conventional aberrometer for mean spherical equivalent (mean difference ± 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02 ± 0. 49 D; correlation: r= 0. 995, p< 0. 001), astigmatic components (J 0 : 0. 02 ± 0. 15 D; r= 0. 977, p< 0. 001; J 45 : 0. 03 ± 0. 28; r= 0. 666, p< 0. 001) and higher order aberrations RMS (0. 02 ± 0. 20 D; r= 0. 620, p< 0. 001). Intraclass correlation coefficient assessments of intra-sessional repeatability for the Aston Aberrometer were excellent (spherical equivalent = 1. 000, p< 0. 001; astigmatic components J 0 = 0. 998, p< 0. 001, J 45 = 0. 980, p< 0. 01; higher order aberrations RMS = 0. 961, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The Aston Aberrometer gives valid and repeatable measures of refractive error and higher order aberrations over a large range. As {{it is able to}} measure continuously, it can provide direct feedback to surgeons during intraocular lens implantations and corneal surgery as to the optical status of the visual system...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest and {{debate about the}} value of video games. There are researchers that suggest that video games are useful tools for engaging learners in engaging and authentic learning experiences (Gee, 2003; McGonigal, 2012; Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, & Gee, 2005; Squire, 2008; Steinkuehler, 2005). However, there are researchers that suggest that video games are harmful, addictive, or exploitive (Chan & Rabinowitz, 2006; Fisher, 1994; Spain & Vega, 2005; Phillips, Rolls, Rouse, & Griffiths, 1995) and disruptive to the learning experience (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2003). There has been considerable research on the educational value of educational video games, and the findings have found that the educational video games are very engaging and interesting. However, as the organisations that make the educational games lack the production budgets results in the video games not being widely adopted by the target consumer. Furthermore, many of these video games incorporate what Bruckman (1999) referred to as ‘chocolate covered broccoli’ approach. This is when a video game is presented as a reward for completing a learning outcome (Bruckman, 1999). Through a review of the literature, gaps in the literature on the educational value of commercial video games were identified. Therefore, this research sought to undertake an empirical study into what types of learning transpires while using a commercial video game. As the process of learning is typically an internal process, the task of identifying if and when learning transpired is sometimes challenging. Although traditional methods of assessments and verbal reflection provide some indicators that learning may have transpired, this research sought to obtain additional evidence through using observational methods. This additional method was possible through advances in video based eye tracking cameras. The availability of high-resolution <b>desk</b> <b>mounted</b> video based eye tracking camera made it possible for this research to obtain quantitative data on potential indicators of cognition or problem solving; endogenous eye blinks and fixations that lasted longer than 600 milliseconds (ms). Ponder & Kenned (1927) suggest that the endogenous (having an internal cause or origin) blink is an indicator of human cognition. This theory has been supported by more recent researchers (Stern, Walrath, & Goldstein, 1984; Orchard & Stern, 1991; Tanaka & Yamaoka, 1993). The other indicator or cognition is when the eye fixates on a specific object or stimuli. The duration the eyes are fixed on a particular object can potentially indicate the amount of processing that is taking place (Just & Carpenter, 1976; Just & Carpenter, 1980). This study used a desktop video-based eye tracking camera to monitor and record the endogenous eye blinks and eye fixations. While the studies into the value of educational video games have provided a valuable contribution to knowledge, very few investigated the transferability of the learning that took place within the game to an external context. To address this limitation, the study conducted in this paper measured pre and post exposure to the learning principles embedded in the treatment. Furthermore, this study observed any improvements in the embedded learning concepts through a physical exercise that replicated the in-game learning concepts to an out-of-game test. The research questions are: RQ 1 : What learning takes place when playing the video game World of Goo? RQ 2 : Does problem solving ability improve through playing video games? RQ 3 : Do the participants that played the video game World of Goo learn tower construction from playing the game? This study identified that conceptual learning did transpire through exposure to a commercial video game. The adult participants exhibited this learning through in-game performance and how to play the game. The children exhibited this learning through demonstrating an advanced understanding of the embedded learning concepts within the game to the out-of-game tests. Furthermore, the children exhibited improvements in in-game performance and reductions in cognition and cognitive problem solving after they were exposed to additional treatment. These findings will be valuable to educators who find it challenging to educate twenty-first-century learners. These learners have grown up with Internet-connected multimedia devices and the pedagogical concepts embedded in traditional media (books, video) may not provide a complete learning experience that they are familiar with. Further, these findings will be valuable for video game developers as the method employed could be used by developers to help identify the parts of the game that the user is struggling with. These findings could also be used by developers or regulators in helping identify the most appropriate target age group for the game. These findings could also be used in future research as this research validated a method for collecting empirical data on individual cognition...|$|E
