5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and hands it to}} her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

Officers approached {{to speak with the}} two men while appellant Carroll stood with his hands inside <b>his</b> jacket <b>pockets.</b> Police asked Carroll to remove <b>his</b> hands <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and Carroll turned and fled. Carrol ran into an alley, but tripped and fell. Packets of cocaine fell <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Carroll was arrested and a search incident to arrest yielded more cocaine. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County suppressed the drug evidence and the Superior Court reversed.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E

He was a match referee for the International Cricket Council.

25|$|Also {{known as}} The Finger Guy, Stephen (Pender) {{is a man}} who pretends to be pulling an object <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> but in facts flips off the person, {{followed}} by oohs and aahs. He generally performs this act to a figure of authority such as a bus ticket collector, a police woman, or a judge. Sometimes these sketches break character continuity. The character is generally depicted as {{a young man in a}} gray hoodie but has also been portrayed as a politician and a medieval knight.|$|E

Before leaving Paris on Monday evening, {{the day after the}} race finished, the winner paid a visit, out of politeness, to Henri Desgrange and, in a gesture without precedent, pulled a sheet of paper <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> It was an article 'in order to simplify the interview', he explained! There he gave his feelings during the race, gave his opinion on the formula by which the race was run, gave a word of congratulation to his rivals.|$|E
25|$|This section deals {{primarily}} with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money {{so he can}} run away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fianc√©e Katerina and will believe {{himself to be a}} thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. This mad dash for money takes Dmitri from Grushenka's benefactor to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his father Fyodor and marry him because he already has the monetary means to satisfy her. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor's home, but quickly discovers she deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father's home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> Then, there is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his father's property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results.|$|E
25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, ‚Ä¶ had a liking and a ‚Ä≤flair‚Ä≤ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. ‚Ä¶ We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, ‚Ä¶ finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. ‚Ä¶ To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf‚Äôs suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. ‚Ä¶ He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy‚Äôs skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he ‚Ä¶ suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ‚Ä≤like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,‚Ä≤ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

500|$|Following Spoletta's departure, Tosca imposes {{the further}} {{condition}} that Scarpia provide a safe-conduct out of Rome {{for herself and}} her lover. While he is signing the document, Tosca quietly takes a knife from the supper table. As Scarpia triumphantly embraces her, she stabs him, crying [...] "this is Tosca's kiss!". As Scarpia falls dead, she declares that she now forgives him. She removes the safe-conduct <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> lights candles in a gesture of piety and places a crucifix on the body before leaving.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the artwork}} for Year Zero {{was created by}} Rob Sheridan, art {{director}} for Nine Inch Nails, who is also credited for artwork on With Teeth, among other Nine Inch Nails releases since 2000. The album features a thermo-chrome heat-sensitive CD face which appears black when first opened, but reveals a black binary code on a white background when heat is generated from the album being played. The binary sequence translates to [...] "exterminal.net", the address of a website involved in the alternate reality game. Reznor displayed displeasure at the extra $10 added to the CD's price in Australia for the thermo-coating, saying it only cost an extra 83¬¢ per CD and that the extra cost came <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
500|$|He {{commanded}} the company's 1st Battery at Fleurbaix, Messines {{and on the}} Somme until 5 August, when he was wounded in a duel with a German officer at Pozi√®res. He and a German officer‚Äîwho was leading an attack against Cherry's position‚Äîwere exchanging shots from neighbouring shell-holes. Eventually, they both rose, firing simultaneously. The German officer hit Cherry in the neck but was mortally wounded by Cherry in return. Cherry approached the dying man, who pulled a package of letters <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> and asked Cherry to have them censored and posted. Cherry promised {{to do so and}} the German handed over the letters, with the words; [...] "And so it ends". He died shortly afterwards. As a result of his wounds, Cherry was evacuated to England for treatment.|$|E

500|$|The {{impression}} of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 {{was one of}} an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom {{was one of the}} first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him [...] "gigantically horrible", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports [...] "so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Loughner {{proceeded}} to fire apparently randomly at {{other members of}} the crowd. He reportedly used a 9√ó19mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol with a 33-round magazine. A nearby store employee said he heard [...] "15 to 20 gunshots". Loughner stopped to reload, but dropped the loaded magazine <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> to the sidewalk, from where bystander Patricia Maisch grabbed it. Another bystander clubbed the back of the assailant's head with a folding chair, injuring his elbow in the process, representing the fourteenth injury. Loughner was tackled to the ground by Bill Badger, a 74-year-old retired United States Army Colonel [...] who had also been shot himself. Loughner was further subdued by Maisch and bystanders Roger Sulzgeber and Joseph Zamudio. Zamudio, a concealed weapon (CCW) permit holder, had a weapon on his person, but arrived after the shooting had stopped and did not draw his firearm. Thirty-one shell casings were found at the scene by investigators.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Jim, an expert chauffeur, is discharged from a garage, for insobriety. Penniless and being unable to obtain a new situation, he takes to the road, a common tramp. At one house where he applies for food, he is harshly refused, {{and is about to}} turn away and try his luck elsewhere, when little Marie, the daughter of the house, comes to his assistance and orders the butler to at once give him the food he requires. She also picks a rose for him from the garden. Jim strolls into a nearby park and sits on a bench to enjoy his lunch. He is about to take a drink from the ever-present flask, which he takes <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> when the sight of the rose, which the sweet-faced little girl gave him, inspires him with a desire to reform. He throws the flask from him, and refreshed by the lunch, he starts out with a new ambition to face the world." ...|$|E
