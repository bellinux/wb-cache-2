40|$|Peatland {{ecosystems}} {{have been}} important global carbon sinks throughout the Holocene. Most {{of the research on}} peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum -dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the <b>jointed</b> wire <b>rush,</b> Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134. 7 to 216. 9  gC m − 2  yr − 1, owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161. 8 to 244. 9  gCO 2 –C m − 2  yr − 1). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14. 2 to 21. 9  gCH 4 –C m − 2  yr − 1), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11. 7 to 12. 8  gC m − 2  yr − 1. Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E.  robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands {{sequester}} carbon (C) through CO₂ uptake and, ultimately, storage as peat. Carbon is {{lost from}} peatlands though gaseous pathways (as CO₂ and CH₄) and water pathways as dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), particulate organic C (POC) or dissolved CO₂ and CH₄. Many {{studies have shown}} that the loss of C through DOC export is an important component of the annual C budget, but there are very few published studies where atmospheric fluxes of CO₂ and CH₄ and waterborne fluxes of DOC are measured at the same time. Also, little is known about the spatial variations in DOC concentration within peatlands and the processes leading to the delivery of DOC into rivers. The research described in this thesis focuses on understanding the ways in which vegetation, temperature, peat quality and hydrology interact to determine variability in DOC concentrations and export, both seasonally and spatially, at Kopuatai bog. DOC concentrations were measured at 14 sites across the bog for a year. At each site peat pore water was sampled from three different depths and represented three different vegetation types dominated by Empodisma robustum (<b>jointed</b> wire <b>rush),</b> Leptospermum scoparium (manuka) and Sporadanthus ferrugineus. There were no strong seasonal trends in DOC concentration, possibly due to the small seasonal range in temperatures. DOC concentrations varied spatially, with highest concentrations found under L. scoparium vegetation, likely due to differing chemical properties of plant materials leading to higher decomposition rates. DOC concentration did not vary significantly with depth. DOC export was estimated using a water balance based approach where evaporation (E), precipitation (P) and change in storage were measured to determine water discharge (Q) from the eddy covariance (EC) footprint. Discharge was then multiplied by average DOC concentrations within the EC footprint to derive DOC export. This method had not been directly applied in the literature. It was estimated that 11. 7 ± 0. 82 g C m⁻² of DOC was exported from the EC footprint from the year 1 February 2012 to 1 February 2013, which is at the lower end of the range when compared to literature values. DOC export had strong seasonal variation with highest export during the winter due to high rainfall and lowest in summer due to low rainfall. A simple method to estimate DOC export was proposed using the strong correlations between DOC export and monthly P and P–E. When annual DOC export was compared to annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at Kopuatai, DOC export was equivalent to only 6 % of CO₂ sequestered in a year. This is in contrast to the literature where, on average, DOC export is often equal to around 25 % of NEE. Preliminary analyses shows that NEE values are significantly higher at Kopuatai than NEE published for Northern Hemisphere peatlands and this is likely an effect of the dominance by vascular plants and the year-round growing conditions at Kopuatai...|$|R

50|$|The species resembles two {{relatives}} - Juncus effusus (the Soft Rush) and Juncus articulatus (the <b>Jointed</b> <b>Rush).</b> Soft Rush (Juncus effusus) is {{a member}} of the Juncus genus found growing in wet areas such as the purple moor-grass and rush pastures and fen-meadow plant associations in the United Kingdom. It is native to most continents. This species resembles it in its height. Juncus articulatus is a species of rush known by the common names 'Jointed Rush' and 'jointleaf rush'. It is native to Eurasia and much of Canada and the United States. It grows in moist areas, such as wet sand, and thrives in calcareous soils. This is a perennial herb producing a mainly erect stem from a short rhizome. The stem may root at nodes, and it generally has one or more cylindrical leaves up to 10 centimeters long. It resembles this species as the leaves appear same, but the tepals are completely different. They are almost blackish-brown, and the main branches are often almost horizontal in the <b>Jointed</b> <b>Rush.</b>|$|E
