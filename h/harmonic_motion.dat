First Wilson associates a bivector with an ellipse. The product of the bivector with a complex number on the unit circle is then called an elliptical rotation.

The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe simple <b>harmonic</b> <b>motion,</b> which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of uniform circular motion.|$|E

The algorithm uses functional eigenanalysis to learn <b>motion</b> <b>harmonics</b> from demonstrated <b>motions</b> {{and then use}} the <b>motion</b> <b>harmonics</b> to compute the optimal trajectory that resembles the demonstrated motions and also satisfies the constraints. The algorithm has been tested on five real human motion data sets to obtain <b>motion</b> <b>harmonics</b> and then generate motions of each task for a NAO robot.

25|$|Vertical <b>harmonic</b> <b>motion</b> results, {{producing}} an impulse that travels {{the length of}} the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back {{from the end of the}} basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{determination}} of molecular structure by geometry optimization became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives {{of the energy}} with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if <b>harmonic</b> <b>motion</b> is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies {{are related to the}} eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.|$|E

Generally, two simple <b>harmonic</b> <b>motions</b> with different fixed phase angles are added in varying proportions to provide an output motion that is variable in phase and amplitude.
