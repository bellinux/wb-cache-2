50|$|The <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Pension</b> (GMP) is {{the minimum}} pension which a United Kingdom {{occupational}} pension scheme has to provide for those employees who were contracted out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1997.

The commission issued its final report in July 2006, and in March 2008 Bachelet signed the bill into law. The new legislation established a Basic Solidarity Pension (PBS) and a Solidarity Pension Contribution (APS), <b>guaranteeing</b> a <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> for the 60% poorest segment of the population, regardless of their contribution history.

50|$|The {{complexity}} arises because different {{increases are}} applied to the various elements of the pension. Supposing the scheme rules allow for annual increases of 3% and the Retail Prices Index increases by 4.5%. The scheme would pay an additional £11.70 in respect of the excess pension (3% of £390), but nothing on the pre 1988 GMP. They would be liable to pay 3% of the post 1988 GMP - in this case £1.50 per month. The individual is, however, entitled to an increase of 4.5% on his total <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Pension,</b> which amounts to £4.95 (4.5% of £110). Therefore, an additional amount of £3.45 would be paid by the state, {{in addition to his}} State Pension (£4.95 less £1.50).|$|E

The existing workforce, {{many of whom had}} very long service and were close to retirement, faced losing their entire pension, including their so-called <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Pension,</b> which was introduced by the Government to replace some of their state pension entitlement, but {{which turned out to be}} neither guaranteed nor a minimum. The BBC's Panorama programme asked Altmann to go to Cardiff to explain to the workers what had happened to their pensions.Altmann was the obvious choice. [...] "She has vast experience in the field, having managed institutional investment portfolios for 15 years, including pension funds, insurance funds and unit trusts."Believing that once the facts were established, the government would recognise its mistake and provide rapid compensation, Altmann spearheaded the Pensionstheft Action Group encouraging members to lobby their MPs for compensation and write to local newspapers. She used her political and press contacts to ensure PAG appeared regularly in news bulletins and newspapers and devised the banner [...] "Stripped of our pensions".

Because DC plans expose individuals to investment and inflation risk, governments mandating such accumulations often provide {{some form of}} guarantee on pension fund benefits. This government support influences not only the accumulation strategy, but also the choice of retirement product. This paper uses a stochastic numerical simulation approach to investigate a number of retirement income instruments {{in the presence of}} two alternative forms of government support: a “pension guarantee”, which is withdrawn dollar for dollar for the private payout; and a flat rate “first pillar” which is provided irrespective of the value of private retirement resources (a universal pension).

This mandatory “retirement insurance” has become under severe pressure, mainly from population aging and from incentive effects that have reduced labor supply. This paper argues Germany needs a pension reform with three main elements: (1) A reformed pay-as-you-go pillar which is actuarially fair, features a transparent notional account set-up, and freezes contribution rates at the current level; (2) A second funded pillar {{which is based on}} US 401 (k) -style grouped accounts that finance the impending aging burden; (3) Augmented by redistributive features that <b>guarantee</b> a <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> and strengthen human capital formation.

The two schemes can be arranged to customize more complex needs, for example the targeted money purchase (TMP) in which is <b>guaranteed</b> a <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> payment plus any upside potential {{in the value of the}} fund assets that exceeds the target level.

40|$|In Chile, {{all covered}} workers must place 10 % of monthly {{earnings}} in {{a savings account}} with a highly regulated intermediary that manages a single fund and provides survivors and disability insurance. Workers pay a commission charge, {{in addition to the}} mandatory 10 %, to finance this insurance and to cover the costs and profits of the intermediaries. On becoming eligible to receive benefits, a worker can choose between a sequence of phased withdrawals and a real annuity. In addition, there is a sizable <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>pension.</b> Unlike the purchased annuities, the minimum pension is not indexed, but adjusted by the government from time to time. The Chilean reform gets high marks for defending the system from political risk and for its effects on capital accumulation and on the functioning of the capital market. The Chilean reform gets low marks for the provision of insurance and for administrative cost. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Chilean reform is the high cost of running a privatized social security system, higher than the 'inefficient' system that it replaced. Valdes-Prieto has estimated that the average administrative charge per effective affiliate while active is U. S. $ 89. 10 per year (for 1991) which is 2. 94 % of average taxable earnings. This is close to 30 % of the 10 % mandatory savings rate. The cost per person is not far from costs observed in other privately-managed pension systems, such as defined- benefit private pensions in the U. S. However, it compares unfavorably with administrative costs in well-run unified government managed systems. The issue here is the administrative efficiency of reliance...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} started process {{of social security}} reform in Turkey is widely argued {{to have a significant}} potential to affect the direction of further development of financial markets in the country in the years ahead, particularly through the planned introduction of privately managed defined-contribution (or money purchase) retirement plans. This paper aims to evaluate the prospects for the emergence and growth of a demand for these plans by analyzing investment risks and associated benefits facing employees purchasing them and to assess the effectiveness of various risk-reduction strategies that might be pursued by individuals as well as the government. Within this framework, a money purchase pension plan, supplementary to the basic state scheme, is considered. Possible variations in a member's pension income, arising due to stochastic increases in salary earnings and investment returns under alternative portfolios, are captured using an actuarial simulation model designed for this purpose. The cost to the government of providing <b>guarantees</b> on <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> incomes and the effects of changes in individuals' investment strategies, retirement ages, and career patterns on the retirement benefits obtained are investigated, and the results are related to various aspects of social security reform-financial market interaction in Turkey. © 2002 M.

40|$|Pension systems’ {{reforms are}} often {{related to a}} shift towards (fully or partially) defined {{contribution}} systems, in which the pension distribution reflects to a larger extent the wage distribution. Additionally, relatively shorter working lives of those that have lower earnings, {{increase the risk of}} receiving lower benefits. The aim of the paper is to present the changing role of <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> as a tool of redistribution in Poland after the pension reform. The new mandatory pension system covers workers born after 1948 and is based on two components – notional and funded defined contribution (NDC and FDC). It replaced the old defined-benefit PAYG system, which had a significant redistribution through the pension formula. The formula itself served as a tool of low income protection, that was additionally strengthened by the <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> <b>guarantee.</b> The new system aims at actuarial fairness, which means that the only mechanism of redistribution is the <b>minimum</b> <b>pension,</b> financed from general taxes. As a result of this change, grater income inequalities of pensioners following those of people in working age are expected. This means a change {{of the role of the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> from one of the tools supporting redistributive policy to the main tool of social policy preventing poverty among elderly persons. The <b>minimum</b> <b>pension</b> is expected to fall compared to average wage. The decision on its level and evolution becomes one of the most important policy questions.
